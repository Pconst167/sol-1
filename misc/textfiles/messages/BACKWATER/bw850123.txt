22   She did not mean it, not then, she was too frustrated, I never trusted her, not enough.
23 
24   I sat down in the chair, softened it for my body, wrapped myself in a blanket til I was only uncomfortable. And too warm.
25 
26   The radio was playing, the lyrics rose and fell, one rose while the other fell, it disappeared forever, til next played.
27 
28   lLyrics buffted me, they tired me. They should be more noble, something ought to be noble now. They simply played and no one
29 said a word to me.
30 
31   I was crying, mourning my loss of beauty, I saw none. The curves of a breast meant only sex to me, and not simply to watch.
32   I was scared, and yet, something awesome was being born inside me, and I was scared of it.
33 
34   A lonely feeling, I admitted, a feeling two months old within me. A feeling of loss, or pathetic cries, never sure which, I
35 remembered, the bronchitus in her, the delirium of worry, worrying about my feelings when she discarded me.
36 
37   The sense of trust ended there, again I was isolated, and my face started showing signs of perpetual worry, selfish worry,
38 and no one said a word to me.
39 
40   Another drop slid over my eyelids, fell down my cheeks. I was counting. Twenty-two so far, and still, no said a word to me.
41 
42   Niot a word.
43 
44   Another feeling, decision was discernable, if I wanted too. At one moment, I would want tto discern the decision, and at the
45 other moment, I would retreat into a frightened evaluation.
46 
47   And It was there, and since I was mature I ought to take it and enact this. And a moment after I thought this, I still did.
48 
49   A sense of terrible purpose had filled the space where indecision was, and I was going to do this thing.

51   One-thousand-one tears.

74 (UPI Portland)  Several thousand dollars worth of damage were done to a local
75 home early this morning.  Police were investigating the home of Mike Day, who
76 had early been arrested on several counts of espionage, when several sounds
77 "exactly like a .357" (according to one officer involved) were heard.  The
78 Multnomah County Sheriff admits that his men "may have over-reacted" by open-
79 ing fire.  The police, according to a neighbor, "let loose with everything
80 with they had.  I haven't seen that kind of firepower since 'Nam".  Day,
81 according to neighbors, was noted as a brewer, and one eyewitness suggested
82 that the "gunshots" were actually only a couple of bottles popping their caps,
83 since home-brewed ales are noted for their yeast content and expansiveness.
84 Another neighbor said that Day had a room "made up just like an Inn.  He liked
85 to stand behind the bar, pour drinks, and listen to stories his friends told
86 him."  While the Sheriff's office had no comment on whether the ale was indeed
87 the cause of the shooting, an additional charge of brewing without a license
88 has been lodged against Day.

91      Hmmm, Been a while...
92 Guardian, Out of curiosity, how might you have met "My long-haired friend", and how did you know that I knew her?
93 But regardless, I will ask her tomorrow.
94 Mark, If I may be so bold, starting ann argument with tilean is highly inadvisible, as he has an almost Klingonoid
95 air about himself when he gets into conflict.
96 Prometheus, I'll have the monitor for you  tomorrow, so you needn't worry about not getting your credit.
97 CaTammy, Are you still in existance? 
98 IfZZZZZZZZZZZZ
99      Consciousness slowly returned to me as I rolled over. Bad move, I thought as the pain from the open wound on my 
100 shoulder arced across my chest. I barely managed to sit up as the memories of the previous evening's fun came back to
101 me. "HI rI looked around at my surroundings: A decidedly feminine bedroom. I was lying on a decidedly feminine be
102 with decidedly feminine pink sheets ; I hate pink. Painfully, I propped myself up onto my elbows. Just then, the door 
103 gave opened, and a breathtakingly beautiful woman entered the room. She was about 5'4", with long, dark flowing hair 
104 that danced on the blue silk blouse that she wore. Somehow, she looked quite familiar, as if from a previous life. She
105 carbent down next to me and began to help me up. I r"I'm ok. I can move." I lied as I started my doomed attemt to rise. 
106 Fortunately, the bed was still beneath me as my leg rudely told me to go bug somebody else. The girl, who couldn't have 
107 been more than 17  or 18, again started to help me up, this time with an "I-told-you-so" sort of grin on her face.
108 This time I let her. For the first time, I saw her face close up; she was evn more beautiful than before. Painfully, we 
109 made our way to the bathroom, which was abnormally large, with an equally oversized bathtub, w
110 which the woman then told me to get into. Slowly I complied. Getting my clothes off gave me a a chance to survey my 
111 damage: I was a wreck. I had skin missing from both legs, and what looked like a bullet wound in my left shoulder.
112 I didn't remember getting shot, but the memory of being flung from the Greyhound was inescapable.
113 The tub was almost full as I  stepped in. The woman was still in the room, and giving me a look that made me long for 
114 my Mr. Bubble. 
115 TheI realized with a start that I still didn't know exactly who this person was.
116 "Ummm, If I may be so bold, Ummm, Who exactly are you?" I asked.
117 "My name is Christine Leason." She said in a trilling voice. "You are Dr. Alexi Danforth, aren't you?" Hmmm, I thought, 
118 How did she know that?? "How did you know that?", I asked, suddenly feeling stupid as I remembered a little something 
119 that had been in existance for a long time: identification; commonly found in one's wallet.
120 "It's called Identification", She said, "Commonly found in one's wallet.", she continued, lifting a hand to reveal my 
121 pilot's liscense. "But seriously,  My father and I have been looking for you for some time now. We need your
122 expertise.". "What expertise might that be?" I asked, now wishing desperately for my Mr.Bubble. "Later." She said,"right
123 now we have to get you  patched back together" She picked up a scrub-brush and started toward the tub.
124 I wasn't so sure I wanted my Mr. Bubble anymore...
125 ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
126 Hmmm, My first attempt at BW fiction... What do you think? Should I bother continuing?? Please let me know...

134     Long night this night
135 
136 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137 
138   I slowly lifted my head, enjoying for a few seconds more the feathered pillow that softened this mattress.  No, not seconds,
139 more like moments, which are more easily twisted into hours when you do not want to wake up.
140 
141   Soft things filled my room, from the pillow to the soft animals I pet and worried over as a child, and many other things.
142   And not a single one of them did I care about, I looked around and there was nothing that I would not delete if it became a
143 useless thing.
144 
145   I do not care about these things, I told myself, and I beleived myself about this. The reason I do not destroy them is that
146 it would be stupid, shredding something simply to be shredding something makes no sense.
147 
148   It was strange, to feel this, and deep inside I was shivering, to know what I seemed to have become while I slept. I have no
149 part of me left from the night before! Is this what it is like to be a grown-up?!?
150 
151 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
152 
153   A startling sense of purpose came over me, as I realized that I was going to this thing.
154 
155   My fingers sslid between the holes. I pulled back to dial the other well practiced numbers. Often I had dialed there, and
156 hung up quickly, scared of her.
157 
158   My fingers grasped the loops, and wrapped them beneath each other, pulled tight. Shoes were tied, pockets held what they
159 should, and my coat was on.
160 
161   I fell into the bench, pleased to be simply sitting again after the jog to get to the stop before the 4:20 am bus went by.
162 
163   I extened my wrists, hand gripped the bar, fingers dripped the coins, eyes met the driver's, shame averted my eyes from his.
164   She still laid there, crying, perhaps she knew what was happening, what would.
165 
166   I tugged at the wire, letting go soon after, soon Amy would come to the door, soon I would nestle with her. Would she hold
167 Or would she force her tounge into my mouth?
168 
169   I pushed the proper bell, waited for the chime, this house ought to have a chime, perfect for one I thought. I heard Amy
170 stumbling down her stairs and start to turn the knob.
171 
172   The overwhelming presence of this moment as a here and now amazed me, as I looked at her beauty and realized what I had now
173 committed myself to. What I had done, and was going to do.
174 
175   She shushed me, told me to be quiet, the neighbors and all, and led me up stairs to her bed room, which added to my tention.
176   To my suprise, she sat down on the terrace floor, looking out from her bedroom. Sitting on the cement, suddenly still, I
177 could not but think thoughts that were to me, profound, to other's foolish.
178 
179   I extended my arms, she took them and held me tightly, seemingly in defiance of Lana. We held each other for a long time,
180 her face hidden from my sight by her hair.
181 
182   She started weeping, or I noticed her weeping, I am not sure, and she sobbed "I do not care about the," She sobbed back yet
183 another series of shudders and continued "soft things in my room, I do not care any more about their beauty." A startled look
184 of amazement crossed my face.
185 
186   I sat her up, straightening her beautiful back, and held her soft cheeks so that she looked at my eyes, and told her the way
187 I had been feeling for the past two weeks. And we both cried.

192      The fourth Allen brother was Stewart, who had a temper every bit as quick
193 to ignite as his flame-red hair indicated.  Although he was accepted as a 
194 brother by the others, he had come home with Jeff one day--and had stayed with
195 the Allens thereafter.  He wouldn't ever speak of his origins, but the others
196 noticed how upset he would get whenever he saw a child mistreated.  He'd had
197 several fist-fights with men he had seen abusing their horses, but his fists
198 weren't quite so quick as his anger, and it had taken interference by one or
199 another of the brothers to save him from a couple of bad beatings.
200     The last of the brothers was Mickey, and no-one was quite sure why he was
201 so much larger than the rest.  Although he wasn't "taller than any tree I
202 ever seen", as Mike said once, at 6'7" he towered over his brothers by at 
203 least six inches.  He had shoulders and strength to match, and had repeatedly
204 beaten all comers in the wrestling matches at the county fair.  We was the
205 most gentle of the brothers, his size ensuring that few would dare provoke 
206 him.  A ragged scar ran down his face, a reminder of the one fight he had l
207 been losing, where his opponent had been putting the boots to him before 
208 Mickey had realized, that big as he was, he was in a fight for his life.  
209 After he'd understood that, well, then he'd reached up with those massive 
210 hands and broken the man's arm.  Afterward, he tried to apologize for hurting
211 the other man, but the man's friends wouldn't let Mickey anywhere near him.
212      A tough lot, the Allen brothers, the forman thought to himself as he
213 moved on up the hill, and yet there was no-one he'd rather have on his side
214 when things got rough, or when the work needed to be done.  He would ask Mike
215 if they wouldn't mind helping him build a new home for his wife and son.  The
216 company quarters given to a foreman were fine for a man on his own, but were
217 too dirty and dingy for a woman, especially a woman like Kim.  Besides, she 
218 was determined that Jinkin would go to school regularly.  The foreman doubted
219 the use of schooling, but when Kim got her mind set, it was always easier--or
220 at least more peaceful--to do things the way she wanted.  Like his boy's name:
221 what kind of name was Jinkin for a man?  He didn't care that it was the name
222 of his wife's maternal grandfather, and he doubted anyone else but she did
223 either.  Well, it was over and done with, no use crying over spilled milk.  At
224 least she wasn't lazy, which was more than he could say for more than most of
225 the people from Ireland.
226      Billy Cleary was a perfect example of why the Irish shouldn't be allowed
227 in America; almost as big as Mickey Allen, he didn't do half the work.  He was
228 probably up in the fog somewhere, sitting on his butt and smoking a cigarette.
229 If only the foreman could catch him doing that, then Cleary'd be practically
230 rode out of town on a rail!  There was nothing more dreaded in the huge pine
231 forests than fire, and all smoking was strictly forbidden by every timber com-
232 pany.  All Cleary, and his best friend and fellow lay-about Bob Starbuck, 
233 cared about was the rotgut whiskey and whores they got in town.  Well, as
234 careless as the two of them were, maybe they'd fall out of the tree they were
235 topping and end the foreman's problems...

238    As the sun sank low in the evening sky, the piper stood watching the 
239 celestial light show -- waiting to see that pure flash of lambent green
240 that legend says follows the tropical sunset.  The tropical sun was bloated
241 and red near the horizon, swelled and cooled by the invisible mists in the
242 depth of atmosphere the light traversed before reaching the island.  The
243 piper shivered slightly, then chuckled thinking of the chill weather back
244 at the inn.  A shiver in 70 degree weather?  The misty rains of his native
245 climate might kill him, if this was cold.
246   He felt a small hand steal into his palm.  He could not see her face in
247 the shadows with eyes narrowed to follow the glory of the sun.  As the
248 bottom rim of the sun began its plunge into the deeps, she spoke.
249   The piper did not recall the exact words she used -- the tone and intonation
250 and marshalling of argument and counter-argument -- but he felt himself
251 swayed by her purpose.  By the time the green flash swept over the heavens,
252 he had agreed to postpone his departure for several more weeks.  He had 
253 acknowledged his debt long ago and she was starting to call it due.

329 Being around the Inn for some time now, both as a lurker and a participant,
330 I've come to appreciate it as a place where people can express what they are
331 thinking and feeling. There's an aspect of the interaction here that I feel
332 is worth noting. Please understand I'm not presenting this as some sort of
333 fact so much as merely a way of looking at things. Some people view others in
334 what I would call 'acceptance mode'. No matter what they have to say either
335 pro or con there as air of acceptance of the other person's viewpoint. On the
336 other hand are those who get into 'judgement mode' where a determination of
337 the quality of the other person's viewpoint is made. There will be some of
338 each of these modes in most any ongoing interaction. It's not always easy to
339 indicate or detect which mode is in effect.

346 Well, if poems are the thing, I guess I might as well join in...

361        DEATH IS A THIEF.

384 Well well.  Backwater is going through a phase I've not seen much of before -
385 all the Harlequin Romances.  Not to mention the poetry.  I myself am waiting for
386 the return to the fantasy (remember Oz?  The Bolos?).  
387 A few more turns of the wheel, I suppose.  Waiting is.

389 ONCE HOOKED TO THE MACHINE, THE ATTENTION WAS FIRMLY RIVETED.  HE COULD NOT TEAR AWAY, DESPITE THE CRIES OF HIS CHILDREN AND 
390 WIFE.  THE BLOOD DRAINED FROM HIS EYES.  HE WAS DECIDEDLY FOREVER WITHIN THE
391 OTHER WORLD BEHIND THE SCREEN.  "GIVE ME THAT", SHE HOLLERED.
392 
393 I GUESS HE DID....

397 Quickly, I moved through the massive door.  Shots were fired again, this time by automatic weapons.  It sounded
398 like a full-scale invasion.  What had NET done that warranted this?
399 The man (who was this guy, anyway?) quickly told me that we were under full attack, and that few agents were around
400 to hold them back.  We were evacuating.
401 The man led me farther and farther, through a twisty maze of passages until I felt sure we were lost.
402 Suddenly, we burst into sunlight.  Our flight had covered several blocks underround.  Off to my left I saw the man
403 who called himself L'homme, carrying several weapons and scanning the area behind us.  He threw me my chrono and Betsy
404 as we kept going.  'I wonder where to now?', I thought.

407 To: Mr. MacHinery
408 From: John K. O'Hara, District Supervisor, North American continent
409 Subject: Common problems
410 Yes, Mr. MacHinery, we do seem to have some personnel problems.  Harry "Sluggs"
411 Foster, one of our operatives, has a nasty habit of hiring teenage punks to do
412 dirty work.  Of course, the intelligence level of the work itself decreases as
413 a whole.  Measures have been taken to insure that similar happenings do not
414 occur in the future.  But we, it seems, are not the only agency with troubles.
415 YOUR agents, Minsky and Flemming, have problems just checking in regularly.
416 I do hope you'll be able to correct the situation soon.  Oh, by the way, I just
417 heard about the assault on one of your holding areas.  Tough break, I would
418 say.  One would think that someone has assumed command of the Bajkneeshies and
419 ordered them to attack.  You don't have any enemies that would want to do that,
420 do you?

423 To: All UNDERGROUND operatives
424 From: John K. O'Hara, District Supervisor, North American continent
425 Subject: Current NET harassment
426 It has come to my attention that certain of our agents have in their employ
427 high-school thugs.  This, in itself, is of no concern to this agency- but the
428 juvenile acts of vandalism that have been committed in the name of UNDERGROUND
429 certainly go against the grain of our policy of 'kill them with wit'.  Pure 
430 violence will NOT do, despair and a few other similar emotions should be 
431 encouraged in the victim beforehand.  Any further such actions done by agents
432 or their employees will be considered to be an application for removal from
433 UNDERGROUND.
434 You do, of course, realize just HOW you are removed.

437 To: Elizabeth Ryan
438 From: John K. O'Hara, District Supervisor, North American continent
439 Subject: Further orders
440 Miss Ryan: Your orders, as of January 24th, 1985 are as follows:
441   1.  You are to find and log any NET strongholds in the Portland Metro area.
442       Reports are to be broadcast via radio at the predetermined frequency.
443       Of course, scramble them.
444   2.  You are to find the whereabouts of the lost ID card with the microdot on
445       it.  The identity of the man carrying it has now been discovered: the
446       man is Eugene F. Farley, of Portland, OR.  This card MUST be recovered,
447       and as soon as possible.
448   3.  Concerning Mr. Farley, again:  He should be driving an unusual car.
449       Decode the following sequence and recite it to the car, then drive it
450       back to UNDERGROUND's Porland branch.  It seems to be the only model
451       FD-78 that didn't explode after 5 days.
452 That will be all for now, Miss Ryan.  Do not forget to begin broadcasting your
453 reports.

460 (UPI Washington)  The trial of Mike Day, of Portland OR, will begin tomorrow
461 here.  The Attorney General's office expressed their confidence in obtaining
462 a conviction quickly, one attorney saying that the government had an open and
463 shut case.  Day has been charged with releasing confidential information (by
464 means as yet undisclosed by the FBI or DIA) relating to a hijacking of a US
465 Army weapons convoy in Washington state.  Day's attorney, Ima Schmuck, said
466 today that their defense would rest mainly on Day's strength of character,
467 although he admitted that the defense was having trouble finding character
468 witnesses for Day.  Schmuck refused to comment on the news that further 
469 charges of attempted bribery were to be brought against Day for offering a
470 "whole case of ale" to arresting officers.

513    Police and Fire officials are still investigating the gun battle, 
514 explosion and blackout in a Southeast Portland neighborhood. Early reports
515 indicate that this chain of events started with a commando-style raid on a
516 home. Before parrived in response to calls that likened the fighting to "a
517 small war", there was an explosion.
518    The explosion was apparently in a sub-basement. This area was apparently
519 added in violation of both the building code and zoning ordinances,
520 according to city spokesman A. Nueman. 
521    FoThe explosion was followed almost immediately by what some claim was
522 a "local electromagnetic pulse". This "pulse" knocked out power in a two
523 block radius and damaged electronic equipment over a wider area. 
524    There has been no official word on what relation this has to the raid
525 and explosion. The ruins of the structure are cordoned off pending arrival
526 of federal experts. 
527    More on this story as it develops.
