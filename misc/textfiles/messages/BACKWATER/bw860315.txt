23 Mike: The "session" on No-Name that was uploaded on Drive B is not anywhere
24 close to being correct. The most likely method used was to EDIT a *real*
25 session that was downloaded by this twit. I say this because the log-on
26 msg is one that is at least a week old.... Also there are other errors that
27 I won't go into....
28 Nom de Guerre: I hope that you had nothing to do with that mess on DB.
29 I also wish that you would realize that your tirades against Destroyer &
30 Silverman are nothing but a waste of disk space. All of the "regulars"
31 have now heard your views at least 6 times. Since most of the responses
32 seem to be "shut up and let us read" maybe you aren't talking to the 
33 "right" people. 
34 If we don't agree with you the first 5 times you state your views, why
35 should we change our minds just because you repeat them *again*? (and
36 again and again and....)
37 Likewise if we *do* agree with you, why do you need to repeat the argument?
38 If you had something *new* to say that would be different. But you haven't
39 changed the *content* of your msg since the first one. 
40 Finally, you complain & make allegations. When people reply, or make
41 suggestions on how you can "avoid" the entries you dislike, or ask you
42 questions you ignore them. From this I can only conclude that (at best)
43 you are one *RUDE* S.O.B. or (at worst) you are a self-centered twit who
44 is only complaining because he can't do as well.

54 Milchar again drifted off to sleep, only to start awake at the sound of a
55 synthesized voice.  "..never kill a living thing, not even an insect..."
56 The mage was so stunned he didn't hear the rest.  Never kill anything?  Er, um,
57 did allowing one of those slugs to fall to their deaths count?  Milchar decided

76 Delta V: this quarter I took Numerical Computation, Compiler Methods,
77    Speech Communications, Short Story, and Ballroom Dance.  The first two
78    took up most of my time and frustrations, and the others helped
79    balance things a little.  this coming quarter though, I'll be taking
80    all computer related classes.  Sometimes I think I've masochistic

85 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Epilogue 2
86    The dawn was just begining to change the sky from deep blue to perple amd gold. The ocean roared against the rocks
87 below as it had since the beginning of time. Tariya dal-Silmarilyn stood at the window, watching. She had loved the
88 ocean since she had been tall enough to peer out of that window, but now it didn't make an impression on her. She felt
89 nothing would ever again.
90    She heard the door creak open behind her. "Tariya!" it was the voice of her sister Jaralla, her immediate senior.
91 "What are you doing out of bed? You're not nearly well enough yet."
92    "I don't care." she said quietly. Jaralla was right, though. Her stomach still ached miserably, but she was getting
93 better.
94    Instead or arguing, Jaralla went over and sat on the edge of the bed. "You will. Soon."
95    Tariya felt the tears begin again. "It's my fault. If I hadn't gotten him involved in Mother's God damned scheme,
96 he'd still be alive! I killed him."
97    "Oh, honey," Jaralla groaned, "you can't blame yourself for what Mother does. She's beyond anyone's control. If you
98 hadn't done it, she would have found another way. Knowing her, none of us would be alive then." Tariya continued to
99 stare out the window silently. "Guess who's here."
100    "Who?" she sighed.
101    "Quallas." Tariya turned to look at her sharply. "He's been at the guest quarters for the last two weeks waiting to
102 see you." Jaralla giggled "I think he's prepared to wait two years if neccessary."
103    Tariya walked stiffly over to the bed and sat down beside her sister. She sighed, "I know why he's here."
104    "So do I. I managed to worm the secret out of him three days ago. He wants to ask your hand in marriage." She
105 chuckled. "He's very handsome. If you weren't feeling so bad, I'd steal him away from you. He might be just what you
106 need, though."
107    "And I'm just what he needs." Tariya said bitterly. "He'll be marrying into the most powerful family on Kadan.
108 He'll be sitting quite pretty."
109    "Tariya!" she gasped, "You know better than that! You've known each other since childhood. He loves you." She
110 looked down at her hands. "I could see it written all over his face."
111    Tariya was silent for a long time, staring at the wall. Finally Jaralla asked "What was the D- what was he
112 like?"
113    She sighed, "He was mean-tempered, immature, obnoxious, self-centered, sarcastic... I never did like him that
114 much."
115    Jaralla looked at her sharply. "Who are you lying to, me or yourself?" Tariya's reply was to burst into tears. She
116 held her tightly, whispering, "Go ahead, baby, let it all out. You'll feel better."
117    Finally she cut back to just sniffles and Jaralla helped her back into bed. She pulled the covers up to her chin
118 and admonished, "If I catch you up again I'll tie you to the bed. I mean it. You need rest." Tariya just nodded
119 silently.
120    Just as she put her hand on the doorhandle, Tariya said, "I'm going to tell him yes."
121    "What?"
122    "When Quollas asks me, I'm going to say yes."
123    "That's your decision, Tari."
124    "James is gone, but I still have a life to live. I think it's what he would want me to do."
125    Jaralla asked sharply, "But is it what you want?"
126    Tariya thought about it for a long time. "Yes."
127    "Then I wish you the very best of luck. But if you get out of that bed again you'll find your luck has run
128 out."
129    Tariya grinned, "Don't worry. I'll behave."
130    Jaralla rolled her eyes, "That would be a spectacular change of pace." She closed the door quietly.
131    In the semidarkness, Tariya whispered quietly, "Goodbye, James. I did love you."
132    Outside, the sun had fully risen, spreading its warmth and promise of a bright new day and spirits renewed.
133                                                                        
134               The End.

137      Well, seeing that the pendulum has yet to swing (for all you BW users
138 too recent or too forgetfull, no one ever *said* this was a "story" or
139 "multi-authored fiction" board! It does have other uses...) purhaps I can
140 convert the remaining potential energy back to kinetic with some questions.
141      Back, back, back in the distant past, some of the ancients might 
142 remember my ramblings about 'The Shape of Things to Come' relating to the
143 future of BBS and, in particular (espically if you wanted to get nasty about
144 it) such promised systems UNICOM or MULTICOM.  Having grown increasingly
145 weary of the slow, featureless, and generally painfull-to-use BBS's out 
146 there I resurected from the grave some of my ideas, and in the interest of
147 evaluating them properly, set up a small system to test them effectively.
148 Be prepared to welcome "Smorgasbord' to the local arena this week; I have
149 already inflicted it on some local SYSOP's to get some ideas and feedback,
150 and could be swayed to give private demos as requested prior to turn up. 
151 Back to my original querry... Just what makes a usefull system? In thinking
152 about this I came up with the following features that I incorporated into
153 the Smorgasbord...
154   o     Individual, private, file areas for local storage
155   o     User definable command procedures for commonly repeated functions
156   o     User defined login command file [AUTOEXEC.BAT]
157   o     A screen editor, and a TERMCAP-like database
158   o     Diverse file t-fer protocols... XMODEM, KERMIT, PACED ASCII, etc...
159   o     Ability to UP/DOWNLOAD messages using file transfer protocols...
160   o     NET's to post to for messages for specific user interests...
161   o     A variety of UN*X-like tools for file manipulation
162   o     A concise, simple-to-use, yet generally extensible and versitile
163 message handling system, with unlimted length text capability.
164   o     Complete, on-line help for ALL facets of system operation.
165   o     Security, sending encrypted [by us OR you!] files OK!
166 These are things that were important to ME, so I put them in MY system. If
167 you were setting up a system that ran on hardware which had virtually no
168 imposed limits [we have more main memory than most systems have for
169 mass storage!] to interfere with your implementation, what features would
170 you incorporate? What would you leave out? 
171  PS: We have the ENTIRE BWMS archives on-line! Access arrangements are of
172 course dependent on the good-pleasure of the group-purchase archivists, and
173 has yet to be negotiated, but is potentially availiable.
174                                                               Aaron

180 Disclaimer: The following is not by me, though it originally was entered
181 with my name at the bottom, rest assured that it is not. BW is and will
182 remain as always. Even given the possibility that I would get tired of
183 dealing with twits, there is another who has specifically stated that
184 he would take over should that ever happen. So fear not, BW has a life 
185 of its own, I am but its caretaker.

189                       ATTENTION ALL USERS:
190 As of 3/19/86, Backwater Message System is going down for good. The
191 reasons for this are many, but the most prominant one is the number
192 of people that have ben abusing this system lately. I originally
193 set this system for messages, open debate, and, occasionally,
194 stories. There has been no debate for months, the twits are running
195 rampant, and, finally, Mr. John Silverman has apparently
196 appropriated this system for his own use. Rather than continue to
197 endure this abuse, I am disconnecting the system. I apologize to
198 all the old time users for this sudden decision, but I think it
199 will be the right one in the long run. I have especially enjoyed
200 running this system the last several years and hope to one day set
201 up a new one incorperating a password system that will better allow
202 me to control the twits. Thank you all for your support and I hope
203 to see some of you on the Blue Parrot and Le Nerd in the future.

210 Orson Wells this guy ain't. Normally I would just remove the offending entry
211 and ignore it, But for some reason this time I decided to let it go with
212 these surrounding comments. As Piper below states, the guy didn7t even
213 capture my style. It's a shame that he can't use the creative powers that
214 are evident in generating the above towards something positive instead of
215 attacking and attempting to destroy others. I feel sorry for him that he
216 feels he must use such means to gain attention and be noticed. You do have
217 ability, why not use it to create something that will make you feel good
218 about yourself? You have the ability, use it. Do something positive. You are
219 wasting your talents with this destructive type of action.

222   RE: message above (if it's gone, I'm not surprised.)
223 -- You did not capture Cistop Mikey's style or substance.  When attempting to
224 counterfeit another's writing, you should pay more attention to the substance
225 and tone of their writing.  Then (if you are ESPECIALLY good, and you aren't)
226 you might be able to slip one over on watchers.  It's unfortunate that there
227 are those with so little intellectual resource that they must resort to 
228 attempts at literary vandalism.  Of course, it's much easier to destroy than
229 to create, and MUCH less satisfying.
230 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
231   The piper listened to the strange, four-armed blue creature for a few moments.
232 Milchar stirred, turned over, then went back to sleep.
233   "I'm interested, but it's not my decision," he said.  "I can't survive in
234 this atmosphere.  If Bard hadn't rescued me, I'd have died painfully."
235   The piper shifted, causing a chain reaction of shifts and adjustments among
236 those sharing the limited space.
237   "The innkeeper," he continued, "Seems to have some sort of spell that allows
238 him to function -- whether or not it will continue to work, I don't know.
239 Milchar may have something on one of his 3x5 cards, but he seems to need to
240 sleep for a while.  I don't know if Cragmore's psi powers will let him visit
241 comfortably in a poisonous atmosphere, and I don't know how long the bard's
242 atmosphere suit s
243 is good for."  (change that "s<CR>" to "is" at front of line.  Drat E.O.)
244   The piper looked about at the small company.  The increased odor of burned
245 rosin with definite overtones of eau d'Allen Bradley was very definite in
246 the enclosed vehicle.
247   "Bard," the piper said worriedly, "Have you been experimenting in here?  
248 If not, we may be in trouble."

257 Bard was busy helping the Innkeeper up off the floor where he had been
258 sitting trying to adjust to the oxigen again. Using a towel to wipe the
259 yellow slime that had run down his chin and stained his shirt, he tried to
260 make himself presentable. 
261      I didn7t hear Piper's warning either, but it did not go unnoticed.
262 Not knowing what it ment, or even what I was saying, the voice inside
263 my head took over. -"Bard! The transdemensional stablizer! It's arcing
264 over! Quick! shut it down before we end up who knows where!"-
265      At that outburst, the occupants who knew the Innkeeeper looked on
266 in stunded silence. What did a medieval innkeeper know of transdimensional
267 stablizers, or that it was deteriorating at this very moment?! The Innkeeper
268 himself was even stunned at his outburst. 
269      Meanwhile, the air in the room quickly began to glow a shimerin
270 bluish green as the stablizer aproached the break down point. The smell of
271 ozone and burnt components filled the small space. 
272      Again the voice inside took over. -"There's too many people in here,
273 it can't compensate, it's overloaded."- As I reached out towards the
274 failsafe switch on the control panel, the emergency statis feild switched
275 on and frozen everyone in position. The high pitched screaching noise of the 
276 overloaded stablizer and the added low pitch hum of the statis field drowned
277 out the sound of the noise of the automatics attempting to handle th
278 overload. The transport began to vibrate and rock as the stablizer began to
279 fail. Would the auto return systems take effect before teh failure was
280 complete? Did this vehicle even HAVE an autoreturn circuit built into it?
281 Of course I had no idea what any of this ment. All I knew was that I had the
282 biggest headache I had ever had since my last drinking binge 20 years ago.
283 And still my hand tried to reach to the cutoff switch. What was going to
284 happen? At least my friends were here this time.

310     The Former placed a paw on the tough outer fabric.  The fabric had grown
311 over itself and that qualified it as a plant.  The chalky white fabric denied
312 the leafy green association he had with plants though.
313     In the folds of the fabric was a round opening.  It was secure and kept the
314 fabric from closing in around it.  Trusting the immense mushrooms to be at
315 least consistant, the Former squirreled through the opening and fell to the
316 floor below.
317     It too was of the mushroom fabric, though several char marks were on the
318 walls, evidence of previous experiments.  Electronics were set on the walls and
319 from the chars on the walls, they had often exploded on the walls too.
320     A few cabinets among the machinery held the scant personal effects.  A few
321 gloves, about three pair, none with fingers, some twine and pointy implements,
322 and a selection of knobs.  This was the home of an tinkerer indeed.
323     Around a corner or two, where mushrooms grew over one another, was the
324 culprit teleporter.  A long metal cylinder rested above a thick cable of wires
325 in every color.  The wires ended at a console.  Six panels were on the console
326 and it appeared, strangely enough, as if all the panels needed to be operated
327 in synchronicity.  Strange.
328     The Former found a bubble in the fabric of these, mushrooms.  Climbing it
329 as quickly as he dared, without ripping the fabric, he peered into the long
330 cylinder.  It was a tube, open at either end.  In the shades of different
331 lights though, it seemed as if-
332     The people gone to investigate the disappearences were appearing and
333 disappearing in the tube!  One second brought a phantom of the Innkeeper,
334 another brought the Piper, and the others too!  The phantoms were lighter and
335 lighter at every moment, though.
336     Assuming this might be fatal, the Former leapt down to the floor.  He
337 dashed to the console and inspected the equipment.  Indeed, each panel needed
338 to be set and ordered simultaneously.  If they panels had been left set for
339 a certain coordinate, perhaps a single panel could get the whole set of them
340 into the chamber at once.
341     The only panel of any urgent demeanor was the center one, with bleeps
342 and whirs at every glance.  There was a row of buttons.  The Former depressed
343 them one by one.  As one was set down, the others rose, and he had no idea
344 what he was selecting.
345     Then he looked up to see the phantoms out of the tube.  They were arranging
346 themselves and preparing to finish teleportation.  The console seemed to be
347 operating itself.  The gamble of letting the console alone had worked.  The
348 phantoms were solidifying, and they were distinguishable.
349     They would need air though.  He set his atmospheric generator to the
350 most industrios setting and cordoned off the room.  The air itself filled the
351 room as the phantoms did the same.

354      At Piper's call Bard started to turn towards the controls. When he
355 heard a voice call out something abou the stabilizer he realized that he
356 was heading in the wrong direction. 
357      He turned back towards the rear of the conveyer just as the crash 
358 field came on. As he waited for the inevitable he cursed the man who'd
359 designed this "safety" feature. The conveyor was going somewhere, but 
360 where?

365 Milchar snapped awake again, and despaired of ever getting the sleep he
366 desperately needed.
367 A mixture of ozone and burnt *something* scented the air which already had
368 little bits of clorine in it.  The air purification systems of Bard's craft
369 (Milchar had been shown such things on the Doctor's TARDIS, long ago) whined
370 at an ever-increasing pitch in its battle against the fumes.
371 NNot much mental energy was required to see that something was wrong.
372 The mage tried to rise-
373 And failed, as a force clamped down upon them all.  A stasis field, said a
374 stray thought, of Milchar's; a modern equivalent of a straightjacket, said the
375 rest of his mind.  The sensation was worse than the dampening field.  For
376 several eternal seconds, Milchar and what remained of his energy reserve were
377 trapped in a very tiny shell.
378 Imagine to be sighted one moment and blinded the next!
379 It is no wonder, then, that Milchar felt relief when finally the field was
380 gone...

385    When the body rebels against external stimulus, the mind takes over,
386 filling in the needed stimulus, providing the organism with its necessary
387 operation, and continuing to afford the human what ever else it demands
388 for existence.
389    Into this self-conscious mode Cragmore went. The crowded ship made him
390 very uncomfortable. The air made him nauseous. And worst of all, the
391 appearance of the alien brought a pain to Cragmore's head like nothing he
392 had ever felt before.
393    Some people consider psi a gift. Some people don't know what it's like
394 to have that third eye under siege. The alien made the hair on Cragmore's
395 neck stand on end. He felt as though someone were scratching a giant 
396 metal glove over a vast chalk board, and piping the resulting sound
397 directly into his brain. Cragmore had met many different life forms in
398 his travels across the cosmos, but never, ever had he felt such tortuous
399 pain.
400    Confusion was Cragmore's first feeling. He could not understand what
401 the alien could have to do with these waves of psi-anguish he was enduring.
402 Necessity soon moved him on from confusion to the need for confronting the
403 problem. He could not stand the torment much longer, but he couldn't leave
404 the ship before the condition of the Innkeeper, piper, and the rest of
405 his friends was more secure. He had to somehow contact the alien, on the
406 psi plateau, and attempt to find some sort of resolution.
407    Cragmore sat down at the foot of piper's couch, made himself as 
408 confortable as possible, gritted his teeth, and set his mind in motion.
409 Initially the screech in his open mind was almost too excruciating to
410 continue, but continue he did. He could not stop. It was too late to
411 go back.
412     Outward his mind flowed. Throngs of mental pain continued to shoot
413 through Cragmore's mind, but the will to make contact over-rode the body's
414 pleas to stop.
415     #...me? Can you hear me? Do you... Do you understand me? Uh... Please
416      listen. I... uh... must get... through to you....                   #
417    Bard's ship shuddered due to causes beyond Cragmore's sphere of
418 knowledge, and in the same moment, Cragmore's body shuddered, and in the
419 next moment, the mind-flow stopped. Cragmore had fainted.

424   More appropriate use?  Unfortunatly, a DiskWriter is far too light to make
425 an efficient boat anchor, and isn't readily combustiable, and thus can't be
426 used to start a fire in a fireplace [unlike the archives, which are readily
427 combustible, and burn with such pretty colors! The same of the free person-

429 have yet to even turn mine on, so BW is certainly better than any of the
430 other potential uses...
431   And by the way, Milch, free fall in 1 "gee" [sic] feels the same as free
432 fall in ANY gravitational field, and in an Einsteinian universe, is un-
433 distinguishable from a non-accelerating frame outside of any gravitational
434 influence...

440      A long time ago there was a person that picked up a telephone and dialed
441 an odd looking number.  The terminal replied "CONNECTED" and a fresh, new
442 horizon had been opened up to him.  He had stumbled upon the Inn at its best.
443 There were a couragous band of characters dealing with what I believe were
444 the blue devils in the Ruby Valley.  It suprised me to find that when one
445 person left off a Different one carried on.  Aside from that, there were some
446 marvelous souls left behind at the Inn -- discussing a wide variety of topics.
447 The person that dialed the odd looking number caught a bit of the fever of
448 what it might be like to actually write something that wasn't an assignment,
449 but rather a personal project.  He even went so far as to start something.
450 When he started BW was haveing a great time, but this wasn't his place to do
451 his writing.  He wrote anyway.
452      Now the time is right to continue, but it isn't the same place anymore.
453 This is not the same benevolent system where the young Master West took his
454 first steps.
455      I thought it would be exciting to be back.  Instead I just stand in the
456 shade, unrecognized, scarcely remembered.
457      What's the old saying?  "The show must go on"?

469      Straxi had been resting and telling the aliens about xhis homeworld.  Then
470 , suddenly, and without warning, he felt someone trying to mentally contactt  
471 him.  
472      The voice was vague, and almost like a whisper.  It sounded as if the
473 sender was experiencing terrible pain, and with each labored word, the voice
474 continued to fade into nothingness.
475      "I.>.. I must get through to you."  Then txehe voice fell silent, and an
476 alien fell.  Some of the aliens cried "CRAGMORE!" and rushed to their fallen
477 friend.  Straxi looked on in confusion, waiting to`see what the aliens did.

497    Milch:  Physics often takes a back seat to art. Ask Escher.  As for
498 Smorgasbord, it will be up briefly later this week, and then up for an
499 extended test through most of the following two weeks. Unfortunatly, the
500 computer Smorgasbord runs on isn't mine, and if I decide to continue the 
501 project, I will have to find a host for it.  If you are interested in an
502 early demo, leave me a note and we will set up a time for you to call in, an
503 offer which is open to the other BW users as well. The public mail system 
504 dosen't seem to want to release public messages, and the nets are plagued
505 with concurency problems, but as a whole the system is reasonably functional
506 and robust. Our standard procedure for new users is to let them call in on
507 a 'monitored' line, so that we can see what they have on their screen, and
508 guide them by voice while they are exploring. Helps, obviously, if the user
509 has two phone lines so that they can explore and ask questions without 
510 logging off.  Not really much of a problem, as you can drop carrier (either
511 intentionally, or accidentally) and the system saves your exact context for
512 you to continue EXACTLY (were talking to the character, here folks...) where
513 you left off prior to the abnormal disconnect. Needless to say, we scrounged
514 most of our functions from the resident OS...
515    Mr. Tricorder: Smorgasbord is not a "promise". It is a private system, 
516 set up purely for the purpose of testing the feasability of such a project.
517 I make no promises as to it's future availiability, only suggest that if a
518 significant user base develops, I will consider maintaining the system as
519 a publicly-accessable BBS. And by the way, Mr. Tricorder, even if L-5 wasn't
520 in it's peculiar orbital perspective and gravitational state, A BODY IN THE
521 MIDDLE OF IT WOULDN'T CARRY WEIGHT "AROUND HERE", EITHER. I knew someone was
522 going to get nasty about it...

564 We also seem to have another person coming in.  It looks like the tour of
565 the chlorine world is indefinitely postponed.  How does the alien feel about
566 an involuntary off-world trip?  You've established a generally peaceful

570   The piper was confused by the action his caution called.  Almost at the 
571 same moment, Cragmore moaned and began to slump, held up by the pressure
572 of bodies in the crowded interior of the bard's vehicle.  Bard began to turn
573 to the control panel, and at the same time the innkeeper was reaching for
574 the controls.
575   The piper wondered vaguely what the innkeeper intended, as everyone in
576 the vehicle was suddenly frozen in place.  The glow of other realities
577 filled the vehicle, the scream of tortured machinery was drowned out in a
578 pervasive hum, and through the windows the surrounding world seemed to 
579 lurch and shift.  Out of the corner of his eye the piper caught a glimpse
580 of a small figure, seen as through the wrong end of a telescope, moving
581 about what seemed to be control panels.  He tried to turn, but found himself
582 caught, prevented from moving by the velvet trap of the stasis field.

589 Hello Aaron,

590      And welcome back (I know it's a bit belated, but the feeling is still 
591 there).

592      That sounds like quite a system you have.... planned?  (In the works, 
593 already running, fill in the blank.... sorry, I'm working from memory here, 
594 and my brain's RAM is a little TOO random at times.)  What's the hardware 
595 you're going to be using for that beast?  It must be rather extensive.... no 
596 C-64 apparently.  And is it going to be designated for a specific use, or is 
597 the use to be defined by the users (a dangerous proposition to say the 
598 least.  Just look at Nom de Guano).

599      On the same note, what has brought you back to these parts?  I had 
600 begun to think that you had forever joined the ranks of the modemless.... or 
601 had at least become extremely selective about your modem use.  Slumming?  
602 Or, (say it softly, quietly ...) did you actually.... miss us?  Nah, 
603 couldn't be, you college boys have much better things to do with your time, 
604 right?  (Don't mind me, I'm just jealous about your opportunities for higher 
605 education.)

606      Oh yes.... certainly the archives rank a bit higher than Scientologist 
607 literature.  I would hope so anyway.  They are, after all, admitted and 
608 honest fiction.

609      And don't be so nasty to the poor ol' Diskwriter than runs BW.  She's 
610 old, she's just a bit retarded, she's cranky, but she works hard and does 
611 what she is supposed to do as well as she is able.... and has done it for a 
612 long time without calling in sick.  Most of humanity can't make that claim 
613 (myself included).

614      Hmmmm..... some welcome, right?  Here I am, berating you.  Sorry about
615 that.  I'd start again, but we're forever locked into Enter Only, and I
616 don't want to be accused of wasting space, so I guess I'll just let it stand
617 as is.  I'm sure you won't mind (wishful thinking).
