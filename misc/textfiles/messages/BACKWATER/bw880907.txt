 70                  GLOWING OUTLOOK FOR FOOD IRRADIATION BUSINESS
 71  
 72           The food industry is going high-tech with a seemingly innocent
 73      procedure called irradiation -- a process that delays ripening by
 74      exposing food to radioactive materials that kill insects, mold, and
 75      bacteria.
 76           Critics point out that irradiation may produce food products that
 77      at best have lower nutritional value; at worst are carcinogenic.
 78      Irradition also poses significant health threats to workers and the
 79      public in transportation, storage, and disposal of radioactive waste.
 80      And there is real concern over the safety of radioactive devices used
 81      in food, beverage, cosmetic, and drug industries.
 82           While spices are the first irradiated edibles marketed in the
 83      U.S., the Food and Drug Admnstration (FDA) also has approved
 84      irradiation for use on produce and some meats. Interestingly, the FDA
 85      regulates irradiation not as a process but as an additive.
 86           The question, of course, is exactly what is "added" to irradiated
 87      food? Irradiated food looks and smells better for an extended time,
 88      but little is known about the chemical changes induced by the process.
 89           One science writer posed the complex issues when he asked "What
 90      do you get when you irradiate an apple with 100,000 rads of gamma
 91      rays.  Is that irradiation a process or an additive?  Who should
 92      control it?  Does it pose a carcinogenic threat to humans? Since it
 93      reduces food spoilage and replaces dangerous pesticides, is it a
 94      blessing for the world's hungry?"  And then he asked, "Why are there
 95      no answers to these questions?"
 96           Meanwhile, the track record in irradiation facilities is anything
 97      but reassuring.  The Radiation Technology plant in Far Rockaway, New
 98      Jersey, was closed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for
 99      willfully supplying false information about repeated safety
100      violations; the NRC also shut down International Nutronics in Dover,
101      New Jersey, after workers reported a coverup of a radioative spill of
102      a tank of water containing cobalt-60 rods; and workers in Isomedix
103      Co., Parsippany, New Jersey, were told to clean up leaks by pouring
104      radioactive water down bathroom toilets and sinks.
105           Earlier this year, the NRC suspended the use of an industrial
106      air-purifying device that leaked tiny particles of radioactive
107      polonium at plants around the nation. The NRC also order 3M to recall
108      for inspection all 45,000 of the ionizing air guns used to control
109      static electricty and remove dust from product containers. Of 828
110      plants inspected so far, contamination was found at 118 sites; of
111      those, the radiation exceeded the reportable limit of .005 microcuries
112      in 39 plants. Subsequently, the NRC recalled 2,500 3M units used in
113      the food, beverage, costmetic and drug industries.
114           Given the potential problems, one would expect to find the
115      irradiation issue on the national media agenda; but it isn't.
116      Meanwhile, as serious questions go unanswered, the government has
117      proposed federal regulations that would allow more irradiation.

129 I've been reviewing the entries of the abortion debate here, and I 
130 would just like to say that I'm impressed (with a couple of exceptions).
131 For an issue that is as emotional as this is, that emotion was well 
132 contained and the debators went to great effort to clearly and concisely
133 state their veiw point. No attempt was made to "win" the argument or
134 convert others to their veiwpoint. Rather it seemed to be more of a
135 heartfelt desire to express that viewpoint in a way that others could
136 understand. And, more importantly, an acceptance of the existance of
137 that view point by the others. As I say, I'm impressed, and it makes me
138 feel just a little better especially after seeing the two canidates
139 one of whom will most likely become our next president try to bash
140 each others brains in and run off in an emotional tiff. "Mommy! He hurt
141 me! He Hurt me! Whaaaa!" It's frightening to think that one of the 
142 most important countries in the world will soon be run by one of these
143 two intellectual morons. Their only intent seems to be to avoid discussing
144 issues at all costs for fear that someone might find out that they
145 don't have any answers. 
146 As I say, after reading the debate messages here again I felt a little 
147 better. Maybe there's hope yet...there really are intellegent and
148 concerned people out there who's vision goes beyond the short term
149 lust for power at any cost. People who wish to express their views
150 as clearly as possible and having a strong desire to know and understand
151 the views of others. There are times when begin to think that is 
152 non-exsistant these days. It's nice to find it still alive and well.

162 I'm coming to the conclusion that good people just don't make it that far in
163 politics. You have to have a real lust for power to put up with the garbage
164 that goes on.
165  
166 Unfortunetly the avoidance of issues is as much a reflection on we the 
167 people of this country as it is on the candidates. The feeling is (And the
168 media supports this.) that we are all to imature to be able to make an
169 educated decision about the candidat's, and must instead rely upon some sort
170  of mistake being made. 
171  
172 Perhaps we are so self centered that we cannot stand to think that the 
173 candidate we are voting for has some opinions that we do not agree with.
174  
175 I read through a posting on another board that put Dukakis down because he
176 had supported gun control bills. Interestingly enough I recently heard that
177 Bush is the only of the two candidats to have actually voted for a
178 gun control bill. (This be the 1968 gun control act I believe.)
179  
180 But because of Dukakis's supposed stance on gun control the poster s not
181 going to vote for him. Gee, I suppose being involved in selling arms to 
182 terrorists and helping to cut back on social programs that help people get
183 out of poverty is alright under those circumstances.

203    Grunt.  Groan.
204  
205    I pulled myself back into Beta-Space.  My vacation over, I knew that
206 my life must continue on...with sorrow, I left P-Space (my PRIVATE and
207 isolated universe) to come back to the Inn.  I had found 'mail' left for
208 me;  I opened the Eye for a moment; the vision I recieved pleased me,
209 one of many people of different beliefs peacefully existing and
210 sharing private thoughts amoung themselves; the Eye closed, my eyes
211 re-opened to the 'world'; and I watched Kurfur debate with a keg
212 of ale in his own, private way.  Kurfur was winning (or losing,
213 depending on your beliefs) against the keg; yet I knew that the ale
214 would triumph in the end.  How strange it seemed, knowing a mighty
215 warrior from many a battle losing against a single, yet inanimate
216 enemy.  Oh well.  At least this enemy brought some cheer and
217 relief for his life.  That, plus it didn't possess a bladed
218 weapon pointed at me.  It was not that he was doing something
219 "wrong" in my eyes.  It just seemed to be an irony, a passing
220 thought that read like a simple story.  I myself have had the
221 delight in sampling alcohol, in many different forms; but I have
222 yet the courage to find enough to make me spin as I float.  Maybe
223 that was why the Mighty Warrior drank;  it was his courage coming
224 through, showing, nay, even yelling, that he was a warrior, and
225 not someone claiming to be one.  I smiled - a rare thing for me,
226 unless in revelry - and gave Bhudda's Blessing to him (which
227 meant no hangover the next day) of mind, which would
228 last a meger 24 hours (only a Master Guru could bestow more
229 than 24 hours - and I mean a GRAND MASTER).  A gift for the
230 warrior, after his long and tiresome travels.  He did
231 not notice me for the moment, instead, he continued talking
232 to others over a time stream in his realm.  I floated to him,
233 weary, tired, and hoping for a sample of the ale he had.
234 It smelled wonderful in its own, 'Earthy' way, the hops
235 climbing just slightly about the powerful smell of 
236 alcohol.  (Ah, well, I guess a short party wouldn't hurt...)
237 so I summoned a keg from the Cellar (yes, the Inn now possesses
238 a cellar!), punched the tap into the keg, and drew a
239 hearty draft into my own stein (in P-Space, where my home
240 is).   I made a simple broadcast to the Crossroads, where
241 it would be picked up by Temporal Sensitives.  Eye, a short
242 party (ack-I always had a low tolerence) Inn the in.

264 and I'm just tired & upset from my trip home.  My True One
265 lives 106 miles from Beaverton, in Springfield.  Every two weeks
266 I venture down to see her, for a meger 12 hours.  Sunday was
267 a special day for me.  I had the day off (I always work weekends,
268 so I had to do some juggling to get this), and spent a wonderful
269 36 hours with her.  And, I'm offically engaged, as of Sunday night,
270 with a somewhat definite wedding time arranged two years from now.
271

374 Nice date, Hagbard. The 132'nd birthday of Oregon. Now for some personal
375 and prying questions:
376  
377 What is the name of your spouse to be?
378  
379 How long have you known each other?
380  
381 Who's nose do you think the children will get?

400    Two answers to two questions I shall give:
401  
402    We have been dating for 6 years, straight out of high school, throug
403 and out of college, to the present.  It was not always nice; it was also
404 not always bad, either.
405  
406    Her first name I shall give (and no more than one): Novia.
407 Pronounce it "Nova".  She hates that name.  I call her by another
408 but it would take too much time to explain that one.  Please, be
409 happy with just Novia.  Besides, our names mean little to each other.
410 What means more we share between us.  What else matters?

492    A "wormhole" was forming in Beta Space.  This worried me, even
493 though my mind had the consistency of tapioca.  So, like any other
494 drunk Guru, I "oozed" towards the door to look through the archway and
495 into the entry wormhole.
496  
497    "Ooze" is a correct description.  It's so much easier to be a liquid
498 than it is to be a solid - ...oh, sorry.  You want to know that I saw...
499  
500    I saw a large Mole, conversing with Wonderer.  (Ok.  This is to
501 be expected)... and so I wandered back in, after floating a few steins
502 their direction - a kind of going-away gift for Wonderer, who was off
503 to another adventure.  Sooner or later, though, he would return, and
504 be with his friends to recount the tales of his travels.

728 Bagging A Quayle-10/21/88-
729  
730  Vice President George Bush has wrapped himself in the
731 flag during his campaign for the presidency -- and in the Pledge of Allegiance.
732 According to Harper's magazine index, Bush recited the
733 Pledge of Allegiance about 25 times in the month following his nomination.
734 But the number of times he recited it while a student at
735 Greenwich Country Day School was zero.
736 Harper's also notes that Dan Quayle has a 25 percent
737 chance of being elected president in the next eight years if
738 Bush becomes president.
739 In addition, there was a 39 percent increase in video
740 rentals of the movie Hoosiers following Quayle's acceptance speech.
741 And the average number of golf rounds Quayle played each
742 week last year was three.
743 For those of you who don't golf, that totals up to about
744 20 hours of playing time each week. Good work if you can get it.--M.D.

747 Dukakis Outdressed Bush-10/21/88-
748  
749  If clothes make the man, then Michael Dukakis would
750 become the next president of the United States.
751 So says Canadian clothier Saul Korman.
752 He claims Dukakis simply dresses more presidential than George Bush.
753 According to Korman, Bush's Brooks Brothers suits hang
754 on his lanky 6-foot-2 frame like a gunnysack.
755 He also says Bush is making a mistake by wearing white
756 short-sleeve shirts on the campaign trail.
757 In fact, he says Bush probably prefers a very
758 sophisticated French cuff shirt, but his advisers won't let him wear one.
759 Still, Korman says Bush's presidential dress is improving.
760 As for Dukakis, Korman claims that his suits sport more
761 of a European cut, and the Massachusetts governor wears a
762 nice assortment of ties.
763 He says the only drawback is Dukakis' sloping shoulderline.
764 But his advisers have been padding them up as of late.--M.D.

773 Why yes, them nasty dirty scumbag smokers should be thrown in jail and the

776 Why the problem is much much worse than a simple case of rape or murder.
777 After all, those are just poor misguided individuals that only need a littl
778 loving to set them on the good road. But a Smoker...Oh lordy me! There's
779 nothing that can straighten one of them out! Once a smoker always a smoker!
780 The only good smoker is a dead smoker! (Given enough time that's a problem 
781 that'll solve itself).
782 Fining them isn't good enough, they should be horse whipped, and thrown in

791      Since it is near time for Holloween I thought a |ittle story
792 in keeping with the season would be appropriate.
793      
794      After a very hectic Holloween, Count Dracula decided that he needed 
795 a vacation. After thinking about it, he decided to take it in Italy.
796 He rented a nice0bemode castle and settled in for a comfortable 
797 and relaxing vacation.
798      Every night he would pop out and capture a lovely Italian maiden, 
799 suck the blood from her body, and throw her off the ramparts into 
800 the moat. 
801      This wend0on for a while until he noticed that there was 
802 no splash after he threw the body. So, the next night he watched 
803 carefully as the body fell towards the dark water. Instead of 
804 hitting the water though, it landed on an alligator which `roceuded
805 to chow down. 
806      In fasination, the Count watched the alligator swollow the body 
807 in only a few bytes. After a healthy belch the alligator, to Dracula's
808 surprise, broke into song.

826                           Unanimity of the Graveyard
827  
828                                Commentary by Owl
829  
830  Unless you are living in a coma, you must certainly know that one of the
831 central "issues" of this presidential campaign is the Pledge of Allegiance.
832 The argument is whedher or not teachers should be required by law to lead
833 their classes in the Pledge.
834  
835 George Bush has repeatedly said that, if he had been governor of
836 Massachusetts in 1977, he would have signed the bill forcing teachers in the
83'0Com}onwealth to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Michael
838 Dukakis vetoed that bill on the advice of the Supreme Judicial Court of
839 Massachusetts and his own attorney general.  That advice was based on the
840 landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in West Virginia State Board of
841 Education vs. Barnette in 1943.
842   
843 This case involved a group of Jehovah's Witnesses, whose faith bars them from
844 reciting the Pledge.  In the late 1930's and early 1940's, hundreds0of
(45 Jehovah's Witnesses were expelled from elementary schools for refusing to
846 recite the Pledge.  In 1943 the Jehovahs finally took their case to court.
847 Excerpts from the Supreme Court's majority opinion written by Justice Robert
848 H. Jac{con (New York Times, August 27, 1988):
849  
850      Struggles to coerce uniformity of sentiment in support of some end
851      thought essential to their time and country have been waged by many
852      good as well as by evil men.  Ultimate futility ov such attempts to
853      compel coherence is the lesson of every such effort from the Roman
854      drive to stamp out Christianity as a disturber of its pagan unity,
855      the Inquisition, as a means to religious and dynastic unity, the
85&0   0 Siberian exiles as a means to Russian unity, down to the fast
857      failing efforts of our present totalitarian enemies.  Those who
858      begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves
859      exterminating dissenters.  Compulsby unification of opinion
860      achieves the unanimity of the graveyard.
861  
862      It seems trite but necessary to say that the First Amendment to our
863      Constitution was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these
864      beginnings.  There is no mysticism in the American concept of the
865      state or of the nature or origin of its authority.  We set up
866      government by consent of the governed, and the Bill of Rights
867      denies those in power any legal opportunity to0coerce that consent.
868  
869      The case is made difficult not because the principles of its
870      decision are obscure, but because the flag involved is our own.
871      Nevertheless, we apply the limitations of the Constitution with no
872 0   0fear that freedom to be intellectually and spiritually diverse or
873      even contrary, will disintegrate the social organization.  To
874      believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies
875      are voluntary and spontanees ynstead of a compulsory routine is to
876      make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to
877      free minds.
878  
879      We can have intellectual individualism and the rich cultural
880      diversities that we owe to uhcepdional minds only at the price of
881      occasional eccentricity and abnormal attitudes.  When they are so
882      harmless to others or to the state as those we deal with here, the
883      price is not too great.  But freedom to differ is not lymidud to
884      things that do not matter much.  That would be a mere shadow of
885      freedom.  The test of its substance is the right to differ as to
886      things that touch the heart of the existing order.
887  
888      If there is any fihud star in our constitutional constellation, it
889      is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be
890      orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of
891      opinion or force citizens to confess by word or qct their faith
892      therein.

916    This will be one of few messages, due to lack ov cbuative writing,
917 name bashing, politics, prisons, ex-cops in prisons getting high from
918 nicotine while hiding it from their supervisors, stupid speeches that
919 you must give in high school or be forced into some obscene punishment,
920 reliwious furvor without cause, and just plain sillyness.  It seems to
921 me that the regulars have let the outside in, but not much of the inside
922 out.  That is to say, there is much debate, but little creative writing.
923 If you wish to debate, please d so, but DEBATE your points, rather than
924 stuffing them down my throat.  Besides, apathy is GOOD for you, when taken
925 in small doses.  It calms the mind, pleases the spirit, and relieves the
926 body, as well as doing the same for friends around you.  Much of American
927 life is literaly burnt from young American bodies, trying to struggle to
928 be themselves, while being crushed into conformnity.  All that is
929 left in later years is an empty, unfeeling, unintelligent husk that was
93 0oncu a happy, loving person.  With small (read:infrequent) doses of
931 apathy, the stress from American living goes away for a short while.
932 The mind is relieved from the burden of multiple responisbilities, as
933 well as from trying to deal with q rapidly changing environment that does
934 not slow down as you become older.  The body feels good in apathy, simply
935 because it wishes to rest and not exert itself (which it would normally do
936 in filing paperwork, riviting a building at 40 heiwhts< or flipping burgers
937 for money on the side) into exhaustion.  The "spirit" (or subconscience,
938 the term I prefer) "feels" the absense of tension and worry, and invites
939 the adventureous attitude that comes from being apathetic in an
940 unvironment that frowns upon it.
941  
942    To make that paragraph short for you, LIGHTEN UP!  If you would simply
943 take your head out of the hole and look around, I think you would fin
944 real problems all around you.  People tend to ignore these< hoping that
945 they will vanish with time.  Couple this with the past events from 
946 World War II to the present, and I think you might understand what
947 I'm trying to say: that it REALLY is out of your hands, that is, there's
948 nothing you ca~ do0for American society except keep to trying to improve
949 it.  Wheather or not someone is elected, it does not matter.  Politicians
950 and Beauracrats have locked most of society out from the ruling position.
951  
952    And remember, the populqb vde does not count for squat.  The
953 electorial college ultimately decides who shall be in the white house.
954 Sounds strange to me, as we live in a so-called "democracy", or rule
955 by the PEOPLE for the PEOPLE, and not for OFFICALS.
956  
957    Cure Reagan beat Mondale with 49 states, but did you know that he
958 only beat Mondale by a few million votes, and not the total landslide
959 that the press had announced?  That landslide was the electorial college
960 pushing Reagan back into the0White House, not the popular vote of
961 the masses in America.  Because my vote does not mean anything, then
962 I choose not to vote at all.  It is a waste of my time and efforts.
