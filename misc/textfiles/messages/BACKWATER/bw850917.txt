26    Breath Deep. Gathering gloom away. Rest now. Regain strength. Illusion gone.
27 Reality here. I am awake!
28    Cragmore was always faithful to the lessons he had learned when he first
29 was told of his special talents. Expenditure of psi energy had to be tendered
30 with rest and recovery. While Cragmore wasn't completely rejuvenated from his
31 recent exertions, he realized he couldn't take any more time now; besides, 
32 there would be plenty of opportunity later.
33    Tayree, the lady from ZEB, and Tin Man were no where to be seen. Bard
34 still lounged in the far corner. Emu could be heard working the controls
35 and calling out numbers to Trainor, who sat next to Piper.
36    Cragmore knew Piper was in bad shape. His rest was no rest at all, but 
37 rather a tumultuous ordeal on the inside that showed on the outside with
38 soft cries and convulsions and a coating of sweat that glistened with the
39 light of the Pell-mell's interior illuminators.
40     Cragmore approached Trainor and spoke in hushed tones. "It is not his
41 wounds is it? It is something much deeper in his body. I can feel the
42 conflict as if thousands of pins were prickling my skin. Piper is
43 emanating a great deal of energy."
44     Trainor looked up from wiping Piper's forehead with a towel. "He has been
45 this way during the entire time you were resting. None of my medicines can
46 help. I thought it best to make him as comfortable as possible here rather
47 than a private room, even if he does not feel our company."
48     "I am sure you have done the right thing. The best thing we can do now
49 is to continue to make him comfortable and hope he emerges from this state
50 be himself. Any interference from myself or anyone else could mean disaster.
51 There are times when even psi is useless. It is very frustrating."
52     Trainor appeared comforted by the dialogue with Cragmore. He had been
53 taking care of Piper alone for over an hour. "Why don't you see how Emu is
54 doing with the ship. We still need to find a way out of here."
55     Just as Trainor finished his sentence, Emu cried out from the control
56 room. "Somebody come quick! We are starting to drift, and the controls of
57 the Pell-mell aren't responding! We're moving towards the place where we
58 found Piper and the young lady!"
59     As Cragmore rushed off to see for himself, Trainor looked towards Piper's
60 traumatized body and thought, We haven't seen the end of this place or the
61 horrible secrets it holds.

65      To  AlI                                 I have a question on Practifile 
66  that I need answered.  If there 
67   is anyone out there who has that 
68   program please contact me through 
69   E-mail.  I was in Batch Entry and 
70     was merging and at the end it gave 
71   an error message and said that it 
72    didn't have enough room for the files 
73   (which it did).  It, therefore, left 
74    the sequential database file open and 
75   I have apparently lost all my mailing

77   about this is urged to respond!!        Sincerely,

88 John - I do visit other boards in town.  I'm a user on Le Nerd and CBBS/NW.  NW

92     Emu was explaining to Cragmore how the Pell-Mell had started drifting
93 when Cragmore's face went blank.  Knowing that it was a psi contact that
94 stole Cragmore's attention, Emu said nothing in the interval.  He did
95 wonder, though, who could be contacting Cragmore; surely no one in the
96 ship could.  Then Emu remembered the scarlet lion's abilities, and
97 figured that she was exercising her mind.  "What a time for mental jumping-
98 jacks," Emu sighed.
99     Suddenly, Cragmore was back.  Well, only partly.  He was holding
100 contact, and giving Emu instructions.
101     "Take relative altitude to plus 200 meters."
102     "What?  What are you ..."
103     "NOW!" Cragmore commanded.  "Now set course to relative angles..."  He
104 resubmerged into the psi contact, then "... relative angles theta 219
105 degrees, phi 19 degrees, and rho ... rho is 137 degrees."
106     "Cragmore, that will put us right..."
107     "Don't talk, just do it!"
108     As Cragmore seemed insistant, Emu obeyed, despite the uncomfortable
109 feeling he had about the course that had been given to him.  The Pell-Mell
110 was now aimed directly at ...
111     "Now, with no time or reality jump, set a physical speed of eighty
112 knots, following the course that I just gave you.  Don't argue, just do
113 it."  At that, Cragmore grabbed the intercom mike and held it to his
114 mouth.  "Okay, everyone, hold tight, we're going to hit some bumpy
115 weather.  Hit it, Emu!"
116     The Pell-Mell lurched forward, and Emu shut his eyes and prayed.  The
117 course that Cragmore had recited took a line directly through the growing
118 spot where they had picked up the piper and the ZEB entity.  With his eyes
119 closed, Emu didn't see the "ground" open up to receive them, nor did he see
120 bright patterns that flashed on the visi-screen, showing the mental wormhole
121 that the Pell-Mell was travelling through.
122     Passing from one reality to another, using conventional methods was
123 hard enough on a traveler's system, but taking a mental tunnel, held up by
124 simple will, was like riding the New York subway through an earthquake.
125 Trainor held onto the wall with his feet and hands, pinning Piper between
126 himself and the wall.  Tayree had enough time to strap ZEB down, and grab
127 those straps herself.  The others did as best they could in the galley and
128 in the restroom.
129     Suddenly, it was over.  Emu shut the engines down, and looked at 
130 Cragmore.  From the back hall, he could hear Fencer sputtering about in-
131 flight bathrooms.  He said quietly, "All right, we're here.  Now, where
132 exactly is 'here'?"
133     As an answer, a form materialised next to Cragmore.  "Allow me to
134 introduce myself."  the forming mist said.  "I'm Milchar."

152    I pawed at the machine, attempting to bring about some other message.  The 
153 system looked easy enougxh to use.  There were two buttons..a red one marked "Send" and a green one 
154 marked "Read"..easy to use, yes... there was also a keyboard and a small button marked "Keyboard Mode"
155 along with a dup,
156 (ch-Dup=duplicate) one marlked "Voice"...I padded the latter, hoping 
157 to contact Lady Tayree and the "adventurers" as Innkeeper called them.
158 The machine sputtered to life and words began to flash across the screen...

165 ...and it made a beeping sound.. I proceeded to begin the message. 
166 
167 Lady Tayree,
168   Fine. Will stay here and await your return with much hope.  Please take good care of Piper and
169 Ms (Mrs?) Zeb..(Mistress?).as well as
170 the rest..Good luck and may all the Gods be with you..

172  ...the machine began to sputter and wheeze, I jumped backwards, scurrying 
173 under the table, cowering..what if it should explode? Did I make a mistake? Will the Inn be destroyed?
174 
175  ..the machine stopped it's insane sounds and words began to flash across
176 the screen:

179 Thank's for writing!

181 ....
182    Somewhere....far, far away from the Inn, in a small craft called a Pell-Mell
183 drifting in a void, a scanner blinked to
184 life...a shrill sound, like a siren, pierced the confined of the ship, and 
185 on a screen next to Emu, words formed..
186 Message Recieved....Message Recieved..
187   Closer examination of the message by Emu and the group revealed it to be a 
188 large amount of "animal" squeaks and tapping sounds....which the computer
189 identified as LuLapine (rabbit) in it's nature, though it could not decipher
190 them...
191 Emu and the rest: If you would likem, you can examine the message, or at least 
192 acknowledge it's existance on the monitors...I'd appreciate it very much!

199 The craft drifted closer to the convolution, aligning itself perfectly with
200 the shaft.  Now for the hardest part of all.
201 What I did next cannot be described to someone whose senses cannot be expanded
202 by spell or device or personal effort.  A rough physical analogy would be that
203 I took firm hold of the edges of the convolution and then pushed them apart.
204 Pain shot through my skull, or at least through my mind.  I could sense my
205 supply of argentium dwindling rapidly under such demands.  I watched the craft
206 move closer and closer to the entry point; every moment the pressure became
207 greater, more painful.  I threw my pain into the effort, and concern for the
208 people inside, too.
209 Abruptly, a sharp pain shot through my entire non-corpreal body.  They had
210 passed through the membrane, and were into the convolution itself.  I nearly
211 blacked out, but the last of the argentium sustained me.
212 One problem solved- to be faced with another!  The end of the convolution
213 frayed with my brutal twisting and expanding.  It snapped away, following the
214 craft down the twisting passage that was itself.  I pushed against the end,
215 tried to slow it.  My efforts seemed to be just enough- the craft shot out
216 into normal space just as the far ends of the convolution met and annihilated
217 each other.  That passage was gone forever.
218 My mind hurt- somewhat similarly to a headache, but all over.  I could feel
219 my physical body shuddering, enclosed in the TARDIS just a few thousand
220 kilometers away.  Despite my pain, I managed to move my psi-body into the
221 craft which was called the Pell-Mell.
222 I entered, and realized no one could see me.  I decided to use the old 
223 telekinetic dust-gathering trick to make SOMETHING visible before them.  Bit
224 by bit, I gathered the minimal amounts of dust within the craft and began to
225 build a shadowy form of myself.  Long moments passed before I was through.
226 "Allow me to introduce myself," I forced the air molecules to vibrate at them.
227 "I'm Milchar."  My dust-form lost its
228 cohesiveness for a moment, causing a few seconds time to reconstruct.  "Oh,
229 what a lu-lu of a migraine I'm going to have for a few days.  Is everyone all
230 right?  I can't really see you in a physical sense in this form, so just call
231 out mentally."

234 just checking in... the story is really rolling now!  Hope that ZEB can
235 survive the ordeal.  A question, should she and Piper be put before
236 a commitee to examine their "crimes".  I can see that Piper is innocent,
237 due to the fact that he was "sucked" into the plain (sp?) but how did
238 ZEB get there, or did I miss important information?

253   we lead a double life.  so easy would it be to live life as simPly as it is
254 given to us.  if one becomes aware that within their mind lIes an expanse of
255 unused potential, they may respond in one of three ways.  a Positive respose
256 is best, looking forward to examine a whole new world.  to be nEutral is
257 another alternative, to do nothing and to siffice at only knowing theRe is an
258 unused channel of awarness -- or perhaps to be ignorant of it.  the last way
259 one might respond would be negatively.  in this case i became aware that i was
260 somehow born with a talent.  my inner mind laid quietly for Years until it
261 would have a chance at awakening.  when that chance came, i rEsponded.  and oh
262 how i responded!  had i not been in a desparate situation, my reactionS would
263 probably have been to jump at cragmore and say it was all some wicked ploy.
264 i wanted to believe that it was all a hoax, a prank.  it wasn't.
265   now alone, only having to contend with both this other being and my nagging
266 mind, i began to relax and re-evalute the situation.  after having applied
267 several compresses to the zeb's wound, i had the ridiculous concept that her
268 body should soon begin to regenerate its damages.  yet why was the cheek that
269 had been the course of so many saline rivers still so cold to the touch?
270   reluctantly, onward with my new toy, my puzzle, my mind.  depending on how
271 cragmore would take my outburst while outside the safety of the pell-mell, he
272 might consider the options open between us.  would he prompt me to a higher
273 level of understanding?  or would he say he understood how i felt, that he 
274 would leave it at that?  moreover, i didn't know which of the two i wanted for
275 myself.  maybe i would decide for myself.
276   once i had entered a state of total relaxation, i began to feel the burdens
277 of my choice to go on alone lift from my shoulders.  who needed help with this
278 mind-game stuff anyway?  the mind isn't all that difficult to understand, is
279 it?  relaxation brought peace, and peace allows for the fulfillment of
280 opportunities.  now that i'm so relaxed, i don't know if there is anything to
281 do or not to do.  i feel tired and the lights with in the compartment seem to
282 be getting rather bright.  with my eyes only half open now i think i almost
283 see this girl before me begin to stir.  it's probably just my imagination.
284 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&  the scarlet lion  &&&&&&&
285 transplanar communication service?  what total hogwash!  (rabbitwash?)

314      Despite my waiting, the large machine made no sound.  I toyed with it 
315 in an attempt to get it to do SOMETHING, but it ignored my touch.  Sneezing,
316 I went back to my little table in the corner of the Inn, where the Innkeeper
317 was staring at a picture on a wall.  I curled up after hopping to the table
318 and tried to sleep, hoping that the machine would wake me up.  But no sound
319 or action followed.  
320      Suddenly, my enose caught an unfamiliar scent, one that had not been
321 here a few seconds ago.  It smelled vaguely of expensive perfume and other
322 things..txe sort of smell that mucks up your sense for a half hour.  I shook
323 my head vigorously to try and keep the smell from messing my nose up, but t_
324 no avail.  
325      The Door to the Inn swung open, and a woman entered.  I recognised her 
326 as the person who came and went most often, who kept muttering "3moredays" 
327 or such, and who seemed to be a person who was not easy to describe, for all
328 my senses scrambled when she was here.  The people here called her Kathyd.  
329 hOh, how many times had I wished that I could speak to her, to tell her how
330 much we enjoy her company, and how I wished she would stay and say more
331 and tell more tales.  Ah, but the species difference makes that a true
332 impossibility.

346 THE TIN MAN sat at the small work bench in the shop just a room away from the 
347 bridge (at least thats what it looked like it should be called) and tried to
348 repair the damage to his storage batteries, or more precisely, prevent any 
349 further damage.  One of the cells had a rupture in the outer casing and had
350 leaked acid into his chest cavity.  A fail safe had neutralized most of it, but
351 the resulting mixture was quite a mess, and extremely uncomfortable.  A second
352 battery didn't seem to be ruptured at all, but refused to give any power 
353 reading.  He wondered if it would hold a charge, but wasn't going to try 
354 charging it with his only remaining cell.  He could run off the one for quite
355 a while without too much trouble, just no hundred yard dashes for the moment.
356 All of this was complicated by the fact that he didn't have a mirror, and it
357 was giving him a stiff neck trying to stare into his chest to do the work.
358    Tin heard someone grumbling about zero-g toilets and suddenly remembered
359 that he STILL hadn't replaced the service cover on the gravity control.  Must
360 get to that first thing.  Just a little more clean-up here and then.... darn
361 how long had that been stuck to his shoe???

367   i've just run across something that is devilishly close to what is going
368 on around here in a short story written almost seenty(!) years ago.  a small
369 portion of it could be read as follows...
370      "...  men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp
371       distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all things
372       appear as they do only by the virtue of the delicate individual
373       physical and mental media through which we are made conscious
374       of them...."                                              -l.
375   i thought of the waters as soon as the meaning popped into my head.  gads,
376 but that man can write!
377 trainor:  temptation would like a definite answer.  let me know what you think.
378           "does she, or doesn't she?"

385   She lay unconcious, her face pale against the grey of her robe.  The
386 only sign of life that showed was the slight rise and fall of her chest, 
387 and the occasional flutter beneath her eyelids as here eyes moved following
388 the actions in some unseen realm.  A slight motion -- then stillness again
389 as she lay there, looking somehow even more vulnerable.
390   Seated near her, in a position of full relaxation, another woman looks
391 carefully at the recumbent figure, trying to discern any hint of motion 
392 under the warm blankets that the lady Tayree used to protect her charge
393 against the encroaching cold that awaits us all.
394   The lady Tayree's face gave little hint at the turmoil and uncertainty
395 that filled her.  The powers of the mind are awesome indeed, but can
396 certainly be mastered -- indeed once the talents have been uncovered,
397 must be mastered for the safety of the person and all those around her.
398   The unconcious woman she knew only as "zeb" stirred once again, a more
399 definite movement, and a feather soft cry from a short expulsion of breath.
400 Deep within, the wounded woman was fighting a desparate battle for survival.

454 Milch had assumed that 'twilight zone' look, staring off into nowhere.  He'd
455 neglected to say what I should do at this point- perhaps intentionally.  Grann
456 looked over one of Milchar's dusty old tomes, mumbled to himself, and kept
457 constant watch on his mentor.
458 It wasn't an interesting show- until the pile of carefully collected argentium
459 began glowing softly golden and disappearing.  It vanished faster and faster,
460 at last disappearing entirely.
461 The violent shift of the TARDIS that soon followed afterwards marked the 
462 beginning of the wild events to come.  Arcs of energy sprang out from the Time
463 Rotor to strike Milchar's hands.  More bolts lept from hidden conduits in 
464 the walls of the control room.  Milchar's robes began smoldering slightly.
465 And that wasn't all.  Lesser sparks flew from the console, wisps of smoke
466 waifted up from several unlikely-looking places.
467 At last I knew what was happening.  Milchar needed more energy, and was tapping
468 any source he could to get it.  I wondered at such a gigantic need for power.
469 The next time he says he needs two kilos, I thought, I'm getting three.
470 The arcing stopped abruptly.  Grann cautiously looked over the chair he had
471 been using for cover.  The view was not impressive.  Several systems had been
472 fused into a blob of metal, I found after a quick inspection.  At least four
473 days of repair, probably five or six.
474 Grann examined Milch.  "Burns all over his body, Doc.  He's still in trance,
475 though, so he won't feel much of it until he returns.  Is there any place we
476 can take him?"
477 "Autodoc.  Medical section two, seventy-fourth door to your left.  I'll help
478 you lug him.  All we have to do is put him in and close the hatch."  I wondered
479 aloud.  "I *DID* fix that thing last week, didn't I?"
480 ??????????????????? The Doctor ???????????????? 21 Sept 85, 3:13pm ?????????
481 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
482 I hope the Doctor won't mind the entry in his name.  He's packing for other
483 parts: Eugene.  Such is college life.  I'll have to keep him up to date.  Not
484 that he's been terribly involved in BW for the last two months or so.

499 I can hardly believe it!  I haven't been on BW since the 17th due to my
500 computer going bonkers and I come back thinking that I missed a few disks
501 and only a few lines have been typed since I was last on!  What is it
502 coming to???  We need more entrys!!  If I had more time I would enter
503 something but alas I do not.  Also,  I have noticed that almost everyone
504 has been represented as to coming into the Inn and been given a description
505 such as "The door blows open and a stranger walks in with a gun ect." but
506 none of this has even mentioned me... I know that this might sound as if
507 I crave attention but could SOMEBODY PLEASE include me (In a small way) in
508 the future descriptions??
509 Adventurers: I compliment you on your writings!  Many times have I been

558 Well, I am finally telephone line capable, even if I can't spell.  Just 
559 a quick note to let you know that I have figured out how to get this
560 b*****d to work.  See you later,
561 *****from RHD*****
562 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
563 What makes you think you figured out how get this bored to work?
564 I haven't seen anyone yet who could figure out this thing.
565 
566 Hey, what's going on around here anyway? It's so quiet around here 
567 you could hear a pin drop. <ping>     What happened to everybody?
568 Did they all die? All I see is a bunch of lines saying that they
569 are lurking. How do you expect anything to happen if your all lurking?!

572 HEY, YOU WRITERS, NOW'S THE TIME TO GRAB HOLD OF THE SYSTEM WHILE
573 ALL THE TWITS ARE OFF FIGHTING WITH THEIR HOMEWORK. 
574 HELLO? ANYBODY OUT THERE??? DON'T TELL ME THE TWITS CHASHED YOU ALL
575 OFF? BRAACKKK! YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF SISSYS! YA LET A BUNCH OF

577 COME ON, I DARE YAH TO TRY SOMTHING! I DOUBLE DARE YAH!! I TRIPLE
578 DARE YAH!!! YA BUNCH OF LILLY LIVERED SISSYS! 
579 OK, BE THAT WAY, LET THE TWITS TAKE OVER. GO CRAWL BACK IN YOUR
580 LITTLE HIDDY HOLES AND SUCK YOUR LITTLE THUMBS OFF.
581 BLAHH! YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN THE TWITIES. YOU HAVEN'T GOT

585 Coming was an empty promise, you have gone and left no footprint.
586 The moonlight slants above the roof, already the fifth watch sounds
587 Dreams of remote partings, cries which cannot summon,
588 Hurrying to finish the letter, ink which will not thicken.
589 The light of the candle half encloses kingfishers threaded with gol
590 The smell of musk comes faintly through embroidered water-lilies.
591 Past Fairy Hill, range above range, ten thousand mountains rise.
592 The east wind sighs, the fine rains come.
593 Beyond the pool of water-lilies, the noise of faint thunder.
594 A gold toad gnaws the lock. Open it, burn the incense.
595 A tiger of jade pulls the rope. Draw from the well and escape.
596 Never let your heart open with the spring flowers.
597 One inch of love is an inch of ashes.
598 Bite back passion. Spring now sets. 
599 Watch little by little the night turn round.
600 Echos in the house; want to go up, dare not.
601 A glow behind the screen; wish to go through, cannot.
602 It would hurt too much, the swallow on a hairpin;
603 Truly shame me, the phoenix on a mirror.
