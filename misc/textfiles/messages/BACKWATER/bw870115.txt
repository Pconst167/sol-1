58 St. Mary's Home for Boys runs a treatment program for teenage
59 sexual offenders who are ordered by the court to participate.
60 
61 Part of that treatment involves the use of a machine called
62 the penile plethysmograph. The plethysmograph is a device that
63 measures erections.
64 
65 The boy is placed in a room, the measuring device is attached
66 to his penis with a rubber band, and he is shown a series of
67 pictures of naked men, women, boys, girls, and children. The
68 plethysmograph measures what turns him on.
69 
70 If he gets turned on by little boys, for example, a treatment
71 program is set up to help him reduce this response. After
72 treatment is completed he is tested with the machine again to
73 measure if his responses have changed.
74 
75 What bothers me most about the use of this machine is that no
76 one has ever tested it on "normal" teenage boys. I suspect
77 that most adolescent boys are so naturally horny that just
78 about anything might turn them on.
79 
80 It doesn't seem fair to me that St. Mary's is trying to measure
81 how "abnormal" these kids are when they don't even know what a
82 "normal" response is.
83 
84 On a more personal level, I'm appalled at the thought of anyone
85 being held responsible for what their penis does. It's been my
86 experience that the little beastes have a mind of their own. I
87 know I'd sure hate to be held accountable for when the little
88 guy decides to raise his head.
89 
90 Besides, I think the whole plethysmograph thing sounds kinky. 
91 It makes me wonder what kind of a psychological effect the
92 procedure has on a boy already suffering from severe sexual
93 problems.
94 
95 On the other hand, I know how you people felt about our old
96 friend Frank Jones. You hated him. The kids in the sexual
97 abuser treatment program at St. Mary's are the Frank Joneses
98 of the future. Do you feel that the way they are being 
99 "evaluated" is justified?
100 
101 Knowing your opinions about ol' Frank I'd be intrigued to 
102 hear what you think of the plethysmograph. Is it justified
103 in light of the kind of adults these boys might grow into
104 with out it?

121 Well, it beats the hell out of a technique I've heard of. (note that I do 
122 *not* know if this is actually used or just the product of someone's
123 deranged mind).
124 You use the same setup as Grand D. described except for a couple of 'minor'
125 differences. The subject is strapped down, and the measuring equipment is
126 connected to carefully placed electrodes. 
127 Any response to the "wrong" stimulus gets immediate negative feedback.
128 
129 Yeah... I hope it *is* only a horrid thought, rather than an actual
130 practice.
131 
132 So I have no objection to the measuring device. What I worry about is the
133 use to which the measurements could be put.

243 To my horror, I discovered that the incantations upon the scroll I had set
244 upon the table had a flaw in them!  The letters began to rise from the vellum
245 sheet, growing and glowing, threatening to explode forth violently.
246 My reactinon was instinctive.  Years of training in magic had taught me many
247 things about incantations, spells, runes, and other written magics, and the
248 big principle involved was simple:  If you make a lettering mistake, you're
249 in trouble.  You're lucky, at that point, if the spell simply consumes itself
250 and leaves a dark smudge upon the table.  At worst, a powerful spell might
251 disintegrate a house before the energies bound in the scroll dissipate.
252 As I said, my reaction was instinctive.  I have at my disposal a spell for
253 just such emergencies, prepared long ago when I first determined the danger
254 existed in the written spell.
255 The scroll and I flowed out of the room as I willed the escape- it was of
256 paramount importance to get the scroll away from the Inn as soon as possible.
257 I briefly imagined what my departure looked like to other patrons... the
258 letters leapt from the page, I start, and both scroll and I flow to a point
259 just before where I had been sitting...  the point disappears with a bright
260 flash.  Conversation continues, some wonder... Innkeeper returns, sees me gone,
261 wonders but does not comment.... the thought faded out.
262 I flowed through a corridor of light, away and toward nothing, moving with
263 apparent high speed  (relative to what?).
264 An explosion.  The scroll expended itself in the tunnel, somewhat ahead of me.
265 A sudden and violent jump in my orientation confuses me, and blackness engulfs
266 all....

306 Listen though to the sufferings in mortals -- how I found them all helpless
307 at first, and made them able to reflect and use their wits. I shall tell the
308 story, not from any grudge to men, but simply to declare the kindness of my
309 gifts. They, then, at first had eyes, but all their sight was vain; they
310 had ears, but did not hear.....They lived in burrows, like the light and
311 nimble ants down in the deep sunless recesses of their caves.....And then
312 I found for them the art of using numbers, that master science, and
313 arrangement of letters, and a discursive memory, a skill to be mother of
314 muses....I taught the interpreting, and I clearly defined omens met in the way,
315 the flight of crook-clawed birds, which ones were of the lucky sort, and the 
316 others unlucky, and the way of living each kind had, what enmities there were 
317 between the different kinds, what bonds of friendship and what associations

328 almost had me.  Very well presented.

337 Leonard - The technology you referred to was the use of the
338 plethysmograph on adult offenders. The description you gave,
339 however, was a bit too extreme.
340 
341 I don't think they strap adult offenders down. They just 
342 let them know that cooperation is the only hope they have of
343 ever seeing the outside of a prision. Inmates are particularly
344 brutal towards perpetrators. They want out.
345 
346 I don't think electro shock used much. If it is it's only
347 used in low voltages and is never applied to the genitals.
348 The preferred method appears to be to put a mask over the
349 nose of the perpetrators nose and give him a shot of 
350 ammonia when he registers the wrong way.
351 
352 These methods are only used on adult offenders, under court
353 order, when they are considered a danger to society. The
354 plethysmograph is only used on adolescent offenders as a
355 measuring device. They are not gassed.
356 
357 KathyD - I admit there's a certain prankster quality to some
358 of my writing but this one is for real. I have to admit, 
359 though, that if you can look at it from a distance it is
360 pretty funny. Though I doubt Frank Jones'd get much of a
361 laugh out of it.
362 
363 Devo - Don't forget that the plethysmograph is attached to
364 a computer and printer. You wouldn't want to forget to 
365 include those. After all, an ejaculation print out is a
366 real conversation grabber at a party. Particularly if you
367 have color.

388 I stopped and pulled the blanket up over Piper, as it had slipped down
389 to the floor.  I carefully picked up the kitten, and took it back to the bar with 
390 me, to get it another saucer of milk.  I noticed a scar on its tummy,
391 and thought that strange.  I wondered what strange adventures such a
392 small kitten had been through, at such a young age.  I must ask Piper
393 when he awakens.  Whatever it was had not affected the kitten's 
394 appetite in the least.  It finished the one saucer, and immediately
395 began mewing for another.  I poured it out, and it drank it up.
396 When that one was done, I carried the kitten back to Piper's chair
397 and set it down on the blanket.

404 to, Oh no. Wait." Cragmore sat back in his seat, furrowed his brow, clasped his
405 hands together, and closed his eyes.
406      "Cragmore?" Milchar looked at his friend. "Cragmore? What is wrong? Oh
407 well, I guess I'll continue to work on my spells while you drift off and do
408 whatever you are doing."
409      Milchar did just that. And Cragmore continued to sit, oblivious to the
410 activity in the inn. He missed the flying letters, and the flight of the
411 mage, who moments before had been carrying on a conversation with him. The
412 flash of light and the soft popping sound of Milchar's unorthodox exit, even
413 by Backwater's standards, went completely unnoticed.
414       The psi specialist was far away from the inn, yet near by time and space
415 standards. His mind had seen something, two beings merged into one. A glowing
416 ball, of incomprehensible origin. A man, a friend. The Innkeeper. Seeing this,
417 Cragmore went into mindsearch, a state where the physical gives way to the
418 mental, and all the psyche assembles for a single goal. The search. The
419 Innkeeper and the ball, a being, had merged. Cragmore saw in his search the
420 choice made by the innkeeper. Vistas passed by his mind's eye as if he had
421 been there to witness them the first time. But was there deceit in the
422 air when the Innkeeper and the entity fused. Yes, Cragmore's mind said, the
423 Innkeeper has entered this extraordinary agreement by his own choice. No,
424 Cragmore's mind countered, choice misled by falsehood is no choice at all.
425 I must look further, deeper, for the truth. The mind agreed.

429 Are all entried berating the anti-net faction automatically attributed to
430 NET personnel? Hardly. Backwater has seen many a time where one character
431 deemed it necessary, for whatever reason, to play both sides of the fence
432 and create controversy and attention. The Bear, PEN NAME, Zepher, J.D.
433 Silverman/Nom de Guerre are among the more notable. It's a common practice
434 and one best ignored. So look before you leap or you might find your
435 landing zone occupied by some very sharp thorns.

442      This may strike you as being unusual (as I do not know what sort of
443 customs exist on the boards you frequent), but the users of Backwater
444 entertain and enjoy their right to express their opinions. Although my
445 intention is not to condemn you for expressing your own, I would like you
446 not to make accusations of the sort in your above message. You mention
447 "playing both sides of the fence." Is this a crime where you come from?
448 This might be new to you, but peoples ideas change from time to time. You may
449 view this as good or bad, depending on which side of the "fence" you stand on,
450 but yet it exists and you can neither deny nor condemn it. Please try to be
451 less naive in future comments.hanks in advance.

455 What do you mean it's aceptable to change your mind about a subject? What kind
456 of way to operate is that? Don't you have any convictions, any close held
457 beliefs? Anyone who has any stability in their existance must hold closely
458 to what they believe. Without it life is but chaos. Of course that doesn't 
459 mean that you must hold so close to your ideas that you cannot accept new ones
460 when they prove to be more accurate than current beliefs. You must be flexible
461 enough to adapt and adjust to a changing world. Anyone that has a closed mind
462 to new ideas will stagnate and die within their own excrement.

468 Finding out that the few friends that haven't gone off to another town are

495 of my life, somebidy forgot to tell me what it means when people put *'s around
496 the words that they write (or type as the case may be), so, could somebody take

499   Well, Larry, we use it here for *extreme* emphasis.  We're limited in
500 what we can do with the type you see -- no underlines, italics, or bold
501 face type, no font changes.  The other convention that we've adopted is
502 surrounding telepathic interchanges by #'s (although we don't do too
503 much of that and the custom isn't rock solid).  Other groups have faced
504 the same problem -- the usenet for example indicates underlining like
505 _this_ -- put an underscore fore and aft of the word indicated.

555 Friar, my STB boarder denotes Strange But True, for I have experienced Out of
556 Body travels. The first time, I can barely remember, but I was around nine
557 years old. I was living with my parents of Sacramento California. I lay in my
558 bed one night during the summer. The bedroom windows were open, and the soft
559 white curtains blew quietly in a summer breeze. I remember looking out and 
560 seeing the moon cast eerie shadows on the trees outside my window. I guess I
561 went to sleep then. I awoke with a start, for I was outside my window, on a
562 large tree branch, looking in at my room through the open window. I remember
563 thinking I must have sleep walked, for I didn't have my slippers on. Then I
564 looked in the window at my bed more closely, and lo and behold I saw myself
565 laying there, resting peacefully. You can imagine what a start the situation
566 gave my 9 year-old mind. I tried to move off the branch through the window,
567 but what ever will I envoked was simply returned as a null effort. I could
568 not move, yet I didn't feel paralyzed. It was as if my body, or whatever, was
569 incapable of movement, but my brain did not realize the fact. I simply was
570 not capable of locomotion, yet I knew that I should be able to move. Except
571 for other OOBEs I have had, I have never had a feeling quite like this.
572 Suddenly, I felt my grip slipping. I realized for the first time the squating
573 position I was in was held tenuously by both my arms on outgrowths on the
574 tree from the branch I rested on. I could move my eyes to see my hand slipping
575 off the branch. Yes there was no feeling save a tiny tingle that first
576 notified me of what was happening. I fell from the branch, yet I still could
577 feel no strong sensations. Now I know this sounds strange, but I landed, or
578 whatever you call it, in my bed. I sat up in my bed, and looked out the 
579 window. The curtains blew and the moon cast shadows as before. There was no
580 evidence of my tree visit. I lay my head back down and went to sleep. The
581 next morning I had to thing rather long about what happened to determine that,
582 no, it wasn't a dream. I was really out there looking in, like an outsider
583 to my own experience, peeking in, and being dropped away. I never told anyone
584 until years later during a Jungian interpretation seminar. Do you want to hear
585 more about my experiences. For now, I will continue to use the Strange But
586 True moniker. I hope I have helped you.

589 SBT - Yes, I want to hear more.  And more about your other OOBEs
590 as well.  Did you have a distinct feeling during your first OOBE that
591 this was not a dream ?  What caused you to drop back into your body ?
592 Were the later OOBEs induced ?  I am very curious, and quite serious.
593 Thanks very much for being open with me.
594 (And what is a Jungian interpretation seminar ?  I only deal in 
595 statistics for my Psychologist clients.)

598 How do you know it was an Out of Body Experience, and not a dream?
599 It's difficult to tell that you *are* dreaming, usually.
600      +Dante-
601 Easy, you go to your favorite well done over medium and ask her if it
602 was an OBE or a dream. Then spend an additional $15 to get it translated
603 into what it all means. Which is a heck of a lot cheaper than $60/hour
604 for a shrink to tell you something about as accurate. Better yet, make
605 your own deductions and save your money. After all, no one else has the
606 information base to make that sort of interpritation.
