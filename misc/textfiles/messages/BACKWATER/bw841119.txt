29      Young Master West was not feeling all the better for having left
30 home on too short of notice, but after what had happened as he had 
31 spyed on his father's wizard giving another one of those secret
32 lessons to an apprentice, and of all things  GETTING CAUGHT!  How did
33 Eldric know I was watching? and what was it that he did when he 
34 slowly lifted his gaze from that other boy straight into the eyes
35 of mine?
36      Time seemed to stand still...  For the next thing I knew, that
37 other young boy had stood up and disappeared as if through a mist of
38 the time passages.
39      Edric, having kept his eyes on me, oh, those dreadful eyes! As he
40 did, his hands moved in slow but certain circles, making odd gestures
41 and uttering words not in a tounge that was common to my fathers
42 family. I tried desperatly to turn and run, but it was of no use, for
43 I somehow knew that I could not until Edric wished it.
44      And then his words faded as if by distance, and my sight of him
45 before me became fogged. Was he to dissapear from me the same way he
46 had sent away his young conjurer? Somehow I felt that the answer was
47 that he was not, but that it was I that was falling through time and
48 distance, but to where?
49      The mist cleared from my eyes and I found myself running along
50 a path that was familiar to me, it was the court road leading away
51 from my fathers home. I was leaving my home! I now realized that it 
52 was the wizard that had set my feet on this journey, and that I 
53 would not be able to return until it was completed to his favor.
54      What journey? Where was I to go, what was I to do, and how was
55 I to know if the path I was to take would be the right one? I could
56 kick my self for not understanding what my father meant when he said,
57 `curiosity killed the cat...  But not the BLACK one!,' and sent his
58 gaze to the smiling wizard.
59      As I ran, thoughts began to tumble in my mind... There sure is 
60 a lot of open space here! But where do I go from here? Although I'm 
61 inside, I know I can't go just anywhere... It's got to be 
62 ``somewhere...,'' but nowhere to hide...
63      My thoughts? Something was wrong, I'm not INSIDE anymore, I 
64 could thank Edric for that, that cursed mage! But it WAS my fault...
65      On down the way, I could now see the township I would often  
66 visit with my father, his castellan, and captains of the guard when
67 they were in need of supplys for my fathers home. Though on the edge
68 of the township the buildings were more seperate, they all had the 
69 feeling of being a part of `one big happy family.'
70      My father always said that you always got your moneys worth at
71 the Inn, and the castellan's men would always return that with sighs
72 and soft smiles. 
73      Although uncertain of my path, I thought it would be safe to 
74 give my feet a rest at the Inn although I only had the few coins I 
75 was sent away with. That would be enough for a stew and cider before
76 I would have to leave...

106 To the Random Deleter,
107      Mikey is a kind soul who certainly would never reveal your identity to 
108 others if he felt you didn't want it revealed.  If he truly knows who you
109 are, then it is "guts" that prevents him from announcing your name, since I
110 am sure he is well aware that there are many users of this system who might
111 take stronger action against you than you would enjoy.  Mikey is a keeper of
112 the peace here, and is probably protecting you by not revealing you
113 identity.  As to "wasting" disk space, it can always be returned to us.  The
114 wasted protoplasm that went into your construction cannot be returned, and
115 that is the true waste.
116      If "guts" is the issue, why do you not reveal your identity yourself?
117 I submit that your anonymity is a result of your fear of what might occur if
118 people knew who you are, as well as a prop for a fragile self-image that
119 might be irreparably damaged if your veil was lifted.  The guise of the
120 masked bandit is certainly an attention getter, and I've probably done
121 exactly what you wanted by paying attention to you, but I've found that 
122 vandals are often highly creative people who have yet to properly channel
123 their energies.  Why don't you use that energy to give us something to
124 read and admire?  You're probably capable.  Show us the side of yourself
125 that can create as well as the side that can destroy!  We can always use
126 another friend and companion.

144 The following story is a continuation
145 of the last book in the Hitchhiker's
146 Guide to the Galaxy...
147 
148      Arthur Dent, having tired of life
149 of the planet Krikkit, desided to see
150 if he could catch up with his friend
151 Ford Prefect.  Unluckly, he had heard
152 nothing of him or the others since he
153 had been dropped off.  He still had
154 the towel from his small navy blue
155 tote bag.  He tried waving it.  Almost
156 instantly, he noticed a strange couch
157 a small distance away.  He ran to it.
158 Unlike the last couch he had tried to
159 catch, this one did not run from him.
160 When he reached it, he remembered what
161 had happend the last time he had got
162 on to a strange couch.  After thinking
163 about it for awhile, he also recalled
164 just how bored he was here.  He jumped
165 on to it.  The next thing he knew, he
166 was onboard the Heart of Gold.  He was
167 inside one of the cabins.  He moved
168 into the hallway.  He didn't remember
169 ever being in this part of the ship
170 before.  After getting quite lost a
171 few times, he desided to see if he
172 could raise anybody on the ship's
173 intercom system.  The only one he was
174 able to contact was Eddie, the ship's
175 onboard computer.  It seemed that he
176 was the only on the ship.  The others
177 had gone.  He told the computer to
178 wakw him up when they returned, and
179 went to sleep.

199 Max: could you try using longer lines (like say 75 or so?)
200 Mikey: During our discussion of the two-level delete you msaid that it sounded
201 like a lot of work for the sysop. What I failed to make clear was that user
202 level deletes would still be visible to the sysop (just flagged, say displayed
203 in reverse video?). Thus All I'd have to do is note if anything looked worth
204 saving. If not, I'd just finalize the delete. Otherwise I could salvage the
205 "good" stuff & then throw the rest out.
206 ________________________________Leonard________________________________________
207 ps. Random deleter: I don't see much point in "wasting disk space" as you 
208 put it, but if that's your bag then it's fine by me. But what is REALLY 
209 bugging everyone is WHY DID YOU DELETE OTHER PEOPLE'S TEXT? 
210 Do you tear pages out of books too?

213 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
214 It saddens me to return to find so much area on our magnetic medium filled with returns, when they could be filled with
215 much more creative things.  R.D., what motivates a person to destroy?  Is it because they haven't any creative talent 
216 and so refuse to allow anyone to see anyone else's creativity?  I think not, I have seen even the most hopeless cases 
217 'blind-following-of-the-masses' turn into bright, thinking, creative people.  I enjoy Backwater because this is the 
218 place I've found that allows you to express your feelings directly, without the muddlings the occur when you are face-
219 to-face (people tend to alter their views slightly to accomodate the audience).  Since no one here knows who you are, 
220 they can react honestly, and you can talk honestly.  If that isn't enough, it also allows us to spin yarns of other 
221 realities, magic, and sometimes a spy story.  The true cause of Backwater's success is that it allows all of us to 
222 participate, to 'put in r two cents'.  Anything may be put here (subject to Mikey's approval, after all it is HIS 
223 participate, tot 'put in our two cents'.  Anything may be put here (subject to Mikey's approval, after all, it is HIS
224 system), just be honest.  Everyone here respects that.  Why destroy, when it is so much more enjoyable to create?
225 All; too tired for anything more tonight, perhaps tomorrow.  I bid you all good night...

230 I have no patience with vandles, and as a result, my normal policy
231 is to repair the damage, and any references to it, since the normal
232 reason for doing this is to gain attention by the vandle. By removing
233 the damage and reference this attention is denied. This sort of 
234 individual can't stand to be ignored. That is the purpose of the
235 vandlism to gain attention. Not willing to let their identity known,
236 since they know that what they are doing is wrong, they only gain
237 a minimal satisfaction out of this. 
238 As you have probably noted by now, I have repaired the damage, but
239 not removed the references to same. This is because of the volume
240 and tone of the statements.
241 Note that in the future I will remove any more references, as it does
242 no improvment to the situation. I will if you wish, also remove the
243 current references as well, so let me know.
244 To the deleter: I fail to see how leaving 100+ blank lines, and saying
245 that you left them constitutes a message. You wanted me to let you 
246 state your mind, OK there it is. Though I don't see you saying anything
247 of value. I am sorry that you feel that destroying other peoples property
248 is an acceptable activity, next time you do it, you might keep this in
249 mind, How would you feel if someone destroyed your favorite item?
250 You don't get ahead in this world by destroying others property. If you
251 keep it up, someday someone will destroy something very precious of yours,
252 possibly your life if you get someone mad enough. I suggest you consider
253 these things the next time you get the urge to destroy. Why not turn it
254 into the urge to create? It is only a small step away.

257 	Flashes...flashes of light. "Thank heavens for these goggles!", L'homme
258 thought, still instinctively covering his eyes with his left arm. Just as
259 suddenly as it came, it went. Silence and quite, save the sounds of the others
260 asking one another what happened.
261 	L'homme, piper, and Milchar made their respective ways down to the 
262 others. As they descended, the crisp quite air of the valley was disrupted by
263 another sound. Loud it was, and deep in tone. "What now?", yelled L'homme.
264 "Is there no peace on earth?", momentarily forgetting where he was.
265 	To the east, the sky was changing color. Hues never seen by human eyes
266 were put on display for all. Formations of clouds like so many cotton balls
267 began to coalesce into definable patterns. The sound grew louder. The trio
268 ran to the location where the machine had once stood. All eyes were turned
269 towards the source of the sound. The outline of a structure could now be seen
270 where the clouds had once been. Lower to the ground it moved, until finally
271 it seemed to settle. The sounds subsided, but the image continued to shimmer
272 with a color that could only be called, spectacular. A wind came up. Funny
273 wind, not like the wind usually found in the valley. L'homme's hair seemed to
274 stand on end. Static electricity! Another flash near the image caught L'homme's
275 attention and directed it once again to the east. The cause of the commotion
276 was now quite clear.
277 	Even a kilometer could not diminish the size of the citadel. Its walls
278 were now clearly visable. The clouds were gone, and all that remained of the
279 preceeding few moments were the ringing in everyone's ears, the images burned
280 into everyone's minds, and the newest member of the valley community, the
281 citadel.
282 	No one spoke. No one moved. Not even Milchar had seen anything like it
283 before. What could one say? A happening like no other. A miraculous exhibition
284 of magic and power far beyond what most of voyagers could imagine.
285 	The stupor didn't last for ever. The leader of the group, Milchar, was
286 certainly far from paralyzed, even if the rest of the party still couldn't
287 believe what their senses told them.
288 	"It can only mean one thing. We must go to the citadel. It is the
289 necklace I wear. Power attracts power. We must go now. Time is of the
290 essence. We must hurry!" Milchar's voice carried a tone not heard from him
291 before. He did not wait for the others. L'homme followed next, with Bard
292 and piper right behind. The others, still straggling, pulled up the rear.
293 	What would greet them? What could all this mean? Questions on every-
294 one's mind. Questions that would soon be answered.

356 took a long pull from his own drink.
357      Oscillations were beginning to appear in the atmosphere at the Inn. Mez
358 wasn't greatly alarmed since this was a periodic occurrence. It was almost as

360 prevents their inclusion here.) arose, when by its own determination the Inn
361 had become too pleasant and peaceful. If, in the course of its encounter

366      Once there was a monarch who had five children. This monarch had large
367 land holdings which were laid out as seventeen equal parcels. After the
368 death of the monarch the WILL specifying the division of the land was read to
369 the family. The seventeen parcels were to be divided among the children in
370 the following fashion:
371           The oldest was to receive one third of all the land.
372           Of the part that was left the next two were each to receive a
373             one third share, and the three youngest one twelfth each.
374           The parcels of land had to remain as they were and were not to
375             be divided in any way.
376      The children, wishing to abide by the terms of the WILL, put out a call
377 to all the land for anyone who could help them with this dilemma.

397 to leave with them." I dont think they can do that, Can they?
398  "No they cannot, I really wish they would give it up. We have to go through
399 this every month just before the energi... err feeding." says the formam.

401   The mistake in his quote was that which could cost the plant everything 
402 since their work force are sndroids not humans. But the androids are so s
403 sophisticated they think they are human.
404  AND NOW BACK TO THE STORY
405  Towering above everyone else stands ramco,the leader of the 6. To his left
406 is getho, welk, and frie. On his right stands golak, sunem, and bulas. They
407 are his followers(the only ones he could persuade)
408  In front of the 6 are all the plant workers who are becoming irratated since 
409 they con't continue with their work.
410  Then the forman comes rushing in to break everything but to his surprise

429         It's that time  again folks.  But take heart,  SPELL ALERT realizes
430 the current situation with the ENTER ONLY MODE. Even with the extraordinary
431 circumstances,  the number of errors is  way down. This commendable advance
432 in message quality can only be  attributed to you, the users of Back Water.
433 
434         Quality of the writing, as well as the spelling, has seen a rebirth
435 in recent weeks,  which is a thankful  sight indeed.  We can only hope this
436 current course stays true. We will all be better for it.

482   From Prometheus;Delinqant
483   Aw gee, what a shame, I missed the latest implementation of a mainframe speel check program (I am getting closer to finding
484 Spell Alert's founders)
485   So sorry not to have participated, but I had things to attend to.  Anyway, I am pleased that Speel Check might just fade 
486 away.  Much the same as one is pleased when a rude companion takes their leave...
487 
488   Assorted messages follow;
489   Man in Gray; No luck on the ANTEATER 1150/45 but there is a lot, I mean a lot, of Czechoslavakian documentation around.
490   The Czech's are responsible for both the NAVATSKIA 450 and 460's however. So the compendium won't be too thin on those.
491   I got a call from Mr. Kendall from Mount Harbson (Unusual, they usually try mail first) and he says they can advance us the
492 money by Thursday.
493 
494   Pam; I still am not to familiar with the current situation, and whether your stay is finite or not. Are we to be abandoned
495 again any time soon?
496   Mad Max; The only important fault that I could find in your story was the line length. Although 40 columns does look good on
497 some computers; it is shabby looking on 32 or 22 column screens.
498   If your screen is 40 columns, after all, then a switch to 80 or 120 columns is probably the most attactive and space saving
499 otion. Although 75 columns is desired, I have aethetic differences with it. Perhaps 120 is best for me, but there is no hurry.
500 
501   Voyeur; Are you getting the miracle baud modem after all? I still think 6 minutes to print out the whole disk is unholy.
502   Kathy; I thin k perhaps your message to the Random Deleter was a little strong, but highly imaginative! Anatomicly impsible,
503 but highly imaginative!

517 Mikey: you can kill my comments about R.D. if you wish.  I'm making 
518 progess on entering the code again (it got to the top of the stack!). 
519 One rather frequent comment puzzles me. "return to normal" does txis mean
520 that you decided NOT to remove/change the lines in question?

540 E.R.D.:O.K. for a start... how about changing your name?  Come up with something new.
541 L'homme: Color will soon grace my inner sanctum, this 64 will be able to spew out video to a color TV.  One problem,
542 I won't get the bloody thing until Xmas time.  Impatient, impatient...
543 ++++++++++++++++++
544 My senses reeled for a moment as the second boom assulted my ears.  I shifted into shadow for a brief moment to avoid
545 much of the shock, then shifted back out.  I cast my gaze to the west, where I saw the most incredible structure I had 
546 ever seen rise from apparent nothingness, stretching out of the ground to tower over the surrounding countryside.  
547 Despite the huge distraction the tower made, I still noted the probably important fact that everyone exibited this 
548 strange glow.  It lasted but a second, and no one else seemed to notice.
549 I felt a warm bath of energy emanating from the necklace about my neck.  It seemed that somehow it knew of the citidel
550 and that it would arrive in this way.  Such a display of magic could only mean a being of incredible power had an 
551 interest in us, in the necklace.  Somehow I got the feeling if we were wanted dead we would be that way already.  I 
552 yelled to the others and began to travel westward.
553 ++++++++++++++++++
554 Good!  Milchar hadn't noticed my trail on him.  I was determined to find out why this particular group hadn't died 
555 already like the others, D or no D.  He probably wouldn't care anyway.  Oh, what was that?  Milchar had jumped through
556 a circle of some sort and had disappeared from sight.  Blast!  He might get away, and I would never find out what was 
557 truly going on!  "Unbqu Ubrm!", I yelled, wanting to be able to move faster yet still remain unnoticed.  I slowly began
558 fading from sight, covered by the veil of a well-cast Invisibility spell.  I jogged ahead, dodging the sharp points of
559 the crystals.  I broke into clear ground after a moment, at the bottom of a small hill.  Ah!  Milchar and the one 
560 Piper were on top, overlooking some action on the other side.  I began to creep up but stopped when I saw another of 
561 their party join them.  That's when chaos decided to sweep the land.
562 I never did remember exactly what happened for the next minute.  Energies too vast to contemplate passed withing feet 
563 of me.  Sound rolled through my head as the crystal began shaking uncontrollably.  And then it all stopped.  Milchar 
564 yelled something to the others but I did not catch it.  They were leaving.  Heading for... Frotz!  Such a tower.... it
565 would take 610.4 on the Umu scale to move such a structure.  D?  No, not his style... Oh, damn.  Everyone has gone and 
566 I'm still here.  Since they're still on the ground, maybe I can make up some time... "Xebqv Mtk!"  I began to rise from
567 the ground.  Suddenly, I heard unearthly cries from the crystal ahead...

570 Arthur Dent was sitting at home drinking a nice cup of tea and reading the
571 paper.  Suddenly, he heard a obnoxiously cheerfull voice.  He awoke with a 
572 start.  This could only mean that the others had returned to the ship.  The
573 computer was in the process of repeating it's message.  Arthur asked it
574 quite nicely to shut up.  When this didn't work, he threatened to short out
575 it's vocal system.  This proved to be much more effective as it then shut
576 up instantly.  He called the bridge and asked if they tell him how to get
577 to the bridge.  Ford, who had been closest to the intercom mike, said they 
578 would send Marvin down to escort him.  Arthur waited.  On the bridge, Ford
579 and the others were debating on what they should do.  They had done every
580 interesting thing could think of already and were getting quite bored...

593 Spell Alert: it's really tacky doing that now, while people are unable
594 to correct their mistakes. I suppose the reason the results were as good
