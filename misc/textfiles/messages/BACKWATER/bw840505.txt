21   yipee! MADE IT TO THE TOP AGAIN! (and NOW good 'ol PAM is back too!)
22 DEBORAH: The end of the text. Am holding the name of source till later.
23 text set in MA 126 (sorry...)
24    What, then, is the word "clouds" likened to?  "Clouds" would denote that which is vaporized (purified) from the dirty water
25 on the earth.  Water symbolizes the fallen man (Rev. 17:15).  Then we may understand that the clouds would signify the devout 
26 saints, whose minds are always in heaven and not on earth, completly reborn from the fallen race of men.  Again, "cloud" is 
27 often used, either in the Bible or in the classics, as a word representing a crowd (Heb. 12:1).  We may see that the word is
28 also used in that way, even today, in the languages of both East and West.  The pillar of clouds by day which led the 
29 Isrealites in Moses' course represented Jesus, who was to come later as the leader of the same nation; the pillar of fire by
30 night represented the Holy Spirit, who, as the object of Jesus, was to lead the Israelites by the fire of inspiration. From
31 the above, we know that Christ's coming on the clouds means that he will appear as the leader of the Christians, the Second
32 Israel, amidst a group of reborn saints.  As we have previously studied in detail, when Jesus answered the Pharisees' question
33 as to where the Lord would come again (Luke 17:37) by saying that where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered
34 together, he meant that the Lord would come to the place where the devout saintswould be gathered together, which signifies
35 the same thing as the coming on the clouds.
36    If we should thus interpret the cloud as a parable, we may as well think that the Lord came on the clouds at the time of 
37 the First Advent. This is because Jesus, though he was in fact born on the earth, was surely one who came from heaven, seen
38 from his significance and value, just as the Bible says, "The first man [Adam] was from the earth, a man of dust; the second
39 man [Jesus] is from heaven," (I Cor. 15:47); "No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the son of 
40 man." (John 3:13)  This is the reason why it was believed that the Lord would come on the clouds, even at the 
41 first coming (Dan. 7:13).

55 sort of liquid.  I decide to follow suit.  The one who was watching me
56 comes over to talk,  what? Threats before actions cause the need? Must
57 be a very reactionary species.  I'll just have to make sure I'm on my
58 best manners.  I smile at the man and ask if he will join me. I request

113 DEBORAH etal: Your explanation of the scriptures (and Aarons) are truly
114 grist for the mill. If as you say the second coming will be only witnessed
115 by those who already believe then it is of no avail. Surely, if such an 
116 event were to ever take place the ones to witness it should be those like
117 myself the unbelievers! Afterall isn't it your whole meaning in life to
118 convert and prostelize? What good would a second, abliet a third coming
119 do if only those who are already blinded by these myths can witness such
120 an event? I for one shall never believe till such time as this phenomenon
121 can be witnessed by ALL! Now try to answer these few questions without
122 citing from your book of myths, in other words just in plain english from
123 your own mind.

142 C.Y.M. NO MY WHOLE MEANING LIFE IS NOT TO CONVERT OR PROSELYTIZE, BUT I
143 DO ENJOY DISCUSSING BIBLE TOPICS, MAINLY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE REALLY
144 NOT AWARE OF WHAT THE BIBLE IS ALL ABOUT, AND MANY MAN MADE IDEAS AND
145 PHILOSPHIES HAVE CREPT INTO SO CALLED CHRISTIANITY DOWN THRU THE YE
146 YEARS. FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THINK THE BIBLE SAYS AT DEATH YOU GO TO HEAVEN
147 OR HELL, IT DOESN'T. SOME SAY IT SAYS THE EARTH WAS CREATED IN 6 DAYS, BUT
148 IT DOES'NT, ETC. AS TO A SECOND COMING FOR THE BENEFIT OF UNBELIEVERS,
149 WHAT FOR? LOOK HOW TECHNOLOGICALLY BACKWARD THEY WERE IN THE FIRST CEN-
150 TURY, AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL DIDN'T ACCEPT HIM THEM EVEN THO EVEN HIS OP-
151 POSERES ADMITTED HE DID AMAZING, SUPERNATURAL THINGS. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT
152 DO TODAY? WHY WOULD A SUPREME BEING NEED TO CONVINCE UNBELIEVERS WHEN
153 THERE'S ALREADY ENOUGH EVIDENCE AROUND, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT.
154 AARON:ANOTHER REFERENCE THAT'S ADDS A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING TO HIS RE-
155 TURN IS IN JOHN 14:2,3,19,22. HERE ONE OF THE DISCIPLES EVEN ASKED,"LORD,
156 WHAT HAS HAPPENED THAT YOU INTEND TO SHOW YOURSELF PLAINLY TO US, AND NOT
157 TO THE WORLD?" THE APOSTLE PAUL ADDS EVIDENCE TO AN UNSEEN PHYSICAL RETURN
158 IN 1 TIMOTHY 6:14-16, STATING THAT HE "DWELLS IN UNAPPROACHABLE LIGHT, WHOM
159 NOT ONE OF MAN HAS SEEN OR CAN SEE." IN THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNT IN JOHN, VS 19
160 SAYS "THE WORLD WOULD BEHOLD HIM NO MORE." MANY TIMES SEEING CAN REFER TO
161 EITHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL SIGHT, PERCEPTION WITH THE HEART AND MIND. IN THE
162 VERSE IN REVELATION YOU REFERED TO, IT IS NOT MEANT LITERALLY. A FEW VERSES
163 ABOVE THAT ONE, VS. 1, IT SAYS THE WHOLE BOOK OF REVELATION, IS A VISION
164 GIVEN IN SIGNS, SOME TRANSLATIONS USE THE WORD "PORTENTS", THUS NOT EX-
165 PECTED TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS LITERAL.
166   IN REGARD TO THE WORD "PAROUSIA" USED AT MATTHEW 24:3, MANY OLDER TRAN-
167 SLATIONS RENDER THIS "COMING", BUT MORE MODERN ONES HAVE A PHRASE LIKE,
168 "PRESENCE", OR "END OF THE AGE", OR "CONCLUSION OF THE SYSTEM OF THINGS".
169 SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE OLDER HAS BEEN THE BASIS FOR THE EXPRESSION "SE-
170 COND COMING" OR "ADVENT" BEING THE LATIN VULGATE TRANSLATION. THIS PUTS
171 ALL THE EMPHASIS ON HIS ARRIVAL AT A CERTAIN PLACE, AND OBSCURES SOME OF
172 THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE WORD. OF COURSE NOW LEXICOGRAPHERS GENERALLY
173 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE PERSON IS THE PRINCIPLE IDEA CONVEY-
174 ED BY THE WORD. SEE "THE EXPOSITERS GREEK TESTAMENT" AND "VINE'S EXPOSI-
175 TORY DICTIONARY OF NEW TESTAMENT WORDS". VOL.1 PAGE 289, IN THE FIRST BOOK,
176 VOL 1. PAGE 208 IN THE SECOND.
177   ALSO IN THIS SAME CHAPTER TO SHOW THAT HIS PRESENCE WOULD NOT BE JUST A
178 MOMENTARY COMING FOLLOWED BY A RAPID DEPARTURE BUT IS, RATHER, A PRESENCE
179 COVERING A PERIOD OF TIME IS ALSO INDICATED IN VS. 37-39. HERE THE DAYS OF
180 NOAH  ARE COMPARED TO THE "PRESENCE OF THE SON OF MAN". SINCE THE DAYS OF
181 NOAH ACTUALLY COVERED A PERIOD OF YEARS, THERE IS BASIS FOR BELIEVING THAT
182 THE FORTOLD PRESENCE WOULD LIKEWISE COVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. THERE ARE 39
183 SIGNS GIVEN IN THIS CHAPTER THAT WOULD PROVE TO HIS DISCIPLES (VS.3) THAT
184 HIS PRESENCE HAD BEGUN, AND IN VS. 34, IT SAYS THEY WOULD ALL HAPPEN WITH-
185 IN ONE GENERATION, ALSO SHOWING A PERIOD OF YEARS INVOLVED. AS TO THE MEAN-
186 ING OF THE CLOUD..........................MORE LATER.

218 CYM - I would agree with DEBORAH in regard that their are an entremly
219 large number of religous people out there who do not make it their
220 goal in life to convert everybody they can to their beliefs. I have 
221 known many people for years before I even found out that they were
222 devoutly religous. It did not affect the freindship before nor after
223 finding this out. I see no justification for your view that anyone who 
224 professes to religous beliefs is somehow a bad person. I do agree with
225 you in that those who activly harass me are a pain in the neck, and
226 that those who deface public propertyare as guilty of crime as any
227 non-religous person, but neither does that make them any worse. I am
228 not a religous person myself, but I also recognize that my views are
229 not the only ones. Just because they ar valid for me, does not make
230 them valid for everyone.
231 DEBORAH - I disagree with your comment that proof for belief abounds.
232 Much of what has been shown to me as 'proof' has been on the order of 
233 UFO type stuff. Most of the rest simply uses its own self satisfying 
234 circle of proof of existance. The bible is one of these. Using the 
235 contents of the bible to prove itself is very poor logic. What little
236 other proof is simply of no value. The shroud of Turin as example.
237 So what about this, I would say that it has been reasonably well
238 proven that this item was used to wrap a man who may or may not have
239 been Jesus. The stains have been been reasonably well proven to be
240 made by blood. Yet this hardly proves that Jesus was anything other
241 then a hebrew who got himself martred, even if we assume that it was
242 indeed he who the shroud wrapped originally. The so called miricle
243 of the image on the shroud has also been reasonably proven to be a
244 natural occurance If it had indeed been wrapped around a man who was
245 bleeding from the various wounds. The shroud of itself proves nothing.
246 There, hows that? Now I've got both sides mad at me!

330 REMEMBER: THE GOVERNMENT WHICH GOVERNS BEST,
331           IS THE GOVERNMENT WHICH GOVERNS LEAST,
332           AND THE GOVERNMENT WHICH GOVERNS LEAST

423 THE SCALE.ITS BROKEN YOU SEE...

432      Dew covered the spiderweb making it glisten like a chain of diamonds
433 in the first rays of sun. I had had better accomidations in the past, but
434 the large fallen log and a few fir boughs had made a comfortable, if a 
435 little uneven, place to spend the night. Drawing somthing that looked
436 much like a mechanical pencil from a jacket pocket, I set about arranging
437 some firewood I had gathered the night before. 
438      TWith the fire started by the laser and a packet of tea the
439 forest did not seem quite as dreary as it had last night. After following 
440 who appeared to be the apprentice into the fog for some distance I lost him
441 on the the scanner built into my reality transphaser. This could mean that
442 he either reality hopped or was obscured by magic, whatever it was it was
443 beyond my magical ability to find him. Looking again at the transphaser I 
444 noted that a very suitable looking anomaly was quite close, and after dousing
445 the fire I decide to head in that direction.
446      As I followed the trace in the display I came to a clearing with a low
447 wall enclosing the anomaly I was looking for, even here in Innisfall where 
448 such things are so common someone took the effort to mark this one, 
449 curious. Stepping over the wall I think I see a glint of jewel like red
450 in the mortar between the bricks, no, just a piece of quartz refracting the
451 early morning sunlight.
452      After a quick check for traps or other safeguards I set about making
453 some adjustments on the transphaser, while doing so I notice a peculiar
454 feeling of instability...

457       A small clap of thunder and the small meadow is again empty.

466 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
467 Well, one person claims my puzzle is too tough, and another says
468 that it is too easy.  Ergo, it must be about right!  Since this is 
469 still today, I won't say yeah or nay on the response given.
470 Hawthorne - That is a rather common problem.  Since I don't remember
471 the solution off the top of my head, and am reluctant to tie up
472 the board while pondering it, I shall get back later.
473 ????????????????
474 Well, I went home, figured it out, came back, reread the problem, and
475 discovered that I am confused.  Do you mean you can only put items
476 on one side of the scale?  How then do you use it, without a counterbalance?
477 Or, are you saying that it is a functioning balance scale, but it can
478 only be used once?  Or is this the actual puzzle - to figure out
479 your message?
480 I came prepared to say to split the stacks into 3 groups, 2 of 4 and
481 1 of 2 stacks.  Balance the two stacks of 4.  If they balance, the bad stack
482 must be in the group of two.  A simple matter then to balance those two
483 stacks.  If one of the groups of 4 is heavier, then the bad stack is in there.
484 Split that into 2 of 2, then split those.  This version of the puzzle
485 usually says that the counterfeit coin(s) is not the same weight, but does
486 not specify whether heavier or lighter, and gives three tries on the
487 scale.  
488 Please clarify.
489 ????????
490 Here's another sequence problem, a bit easier, and should be particularly
491 solveable by computer users.  Find the missing number:
492 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24, 31, 100, ??, 10000, 1111111111111111

495 About the religious discussions:  I myself am not actively religious
496 or non-religious, so do not and will not get involved in them.  However,
497 I do not mind that others do, as that is part of the charm of the
498 Backwater Message System.  A potpourri of thoughts, ideas, and nonsense.
499 My only request is that these topics do not take an overproportionate share
500 of the disk space, and access time.  I also wish there was some way of
501 skipping past them when I am not in the mood, rather than watching the words
502 flow past on the screen while I fidget.  Alas, even the beloved Backwater
503 is not perfect.
504 Enough said.

506 To the above person who says there is no truth in the bible:
507 If none of it is true, then what of the Beast of which you are so fond? 
508 The Beast in our culture refers to the Beast of the Apocalypse, from the 
509 Revelation of Saint John. Thus you contradict yourself, unless of course
510 you're referring to a grizzly bear or wombat or something.
511                && The Mad Actor &&
512 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
513 UNBELIEVER: I DON'T KNOW IF ANARCHY IS THE ANSWER, BUT I DO AGREE THAT
514 GOVERNMENT HAS IT'S PROBLEMS. I PERSONALLY DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH
515 A THING AS A WORKABLE HUMAN GOVERNMENT. BUT OURS DOES PROVIDE MINIMAL
516 SCHOOL, FIRE, AND POLICE PROTECTION. NOT ALL BAD.

518 ########################################
519 DEBORAH: I do believe I owe you an apology; I wasn't refering to you per-se 
520 but to the teachings of the christian community as to prostelizing the 
521 word of god (lower case intended). I was raised in parochial schools and
522 I know of what I speak. If one professes to be a true christian then he/
523 she must "spread the word of God" ie the bible. If this is not done then
524 there is no salvation. Even though there are some good moral lessons in the
525 book, it is still debatable as to its validity eithe in its present form
526 or in the original (whatever that may be). To base ones whole existence on
527 this concept is totally undesirable to many and especially to me. To bring
528 a child into this troubled world and cram this stuff into his otherwise 
529 perfect mind is inexcusable. Believe what you will but don't, DON'T try to
530 make others decissions for them.

544 I believe that the human race is stonger and more survivable as a group,
545 and therefore need a type of government.  The best government for a group
546 of humans is a government that acts like a human... a human has survived
547 all of these centuries because of it's adaptability to its habitat.
548 The government that controls this race without separating it is one that
549 will adjust as the race does, and therefore become more survivable with
550 the human race.....The problems of this government are not directly
551 its policies, but are its traditionalized minds of the people, who hold
552 it back from adjusting as the people do, and allowing the instict of
553 survival to be apparent in the society as a whole.
