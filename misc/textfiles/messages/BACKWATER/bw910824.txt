 45 L'homme, the connection is up, so I assume you got things fixed.  Thanks!
 46 BTW, if you find somebody good to give you lessons, let me know, as I 
 47 really need to get serious about my playing.  I've built up some of the

 51 TV, lyrics/poetry have been a hobby of mine since I was about 13 or
 52 so.  I seldom manage to write anything interesting though.  But when
 53 I get depressed about it, I just turn on the radio and listen to 
 54 the bulk of the top 40 drivel.  It ussually makes me feel atleast 
 55 average.

 60 they see a sight to see.
 61 And in my heart I know that I'll refine the things in me.

 84 My problems with Eleanor didn't START with the samples scam but with a
 85 miserable incident the end of the previous spring term regarding the new
 86 school cook.  Wilma had worked for PPS for about 13 years, most of it at 
 87 a school to which a former principle at our site had just been assigned.
 88 Evidently Candi didn't like Wilma's style and had her "transferred out."
 89 So by the time Wilma got to our site, it was all over her and by the end
 90 o her first thre months, someone had ordered a five-menber white-coated 
 91 investigation team from Food Services to terrorize her (and her student
 92 workers) for about a week.  And, of course, there was more than the usual
 93 vicious gossip about Wilma that week and a great rolling of eyes from 
 94 those whose style it was t do so.  Eleanor (or some OTHER "frizzy blonde")
 95 also chose this time to throw a public fit about being overcharged for 
 96 her lunch, with added insults about extreme disorganization ... all in 
 97 front of a cafeteria full of K-5 students and the school and Other staff
 98 nenbers.  The blonde's concluding statements were, I was told, something
 99 to the effect "Bob [Honcho] wil har about this."  And he evidently did
100 because not soon afterward a rather catty group mem to Bob was 
101 circulated for signatures about these very things.
102  
103 At first I thought it was a joke -- kind of an extension of our experi-
104 mental "group therapy" sessions (our supervisor DID seem to try EVERY-
105 thing to alter certain group sentiment/sediment) and a primary school
106 lesson review of how NOT to be.  But NoooOOOooo ... they were actually
107 SERIOUS and a subsequent all-school meeting was held in the fall to 
108 further harass the poor cook.  As it ended up, Wilma took early retirement
109 after being told she would be transfered again and simply didn't return
110 from the same spring vacation chuck didn't.
111  
112 As I wrote to the Board, I can't imagine what impression this whole thing
113 left on a school full of kids, but I sure ended up in some deep deep dodo 
114 for draftig a memo I was told I couldn't distribute to department members
115 reminding them of the well-known long-standing problems of the Food Services
116 department and the whole horrible history of previous inequities of and by
117 former food services employees at that site.  ZDespite some wonderful 
118 letters of recommendation in my file and conssiten favorable comments on 
119 previous evaluations  regarding not only excellent computer skills but 
120 "exceeded expectation" in public relations with specific comments regarding
121 a positive phone demeanor (willingness to try to help ... Eleanor stating
122 that "teachers loved me") and specifically for that year, indirect refer-
123 ences were made about my "behavior" regarding this incident on that year's 
124 evaluation ... the point being, I believe, that I was to draft a report 
125 about this uglness to Employee Relations and REALLY get gang raped ... 
126 maybe even ARRESTED (they've got their own police force, you know).
127  
128 Of course, I wasn't about to do THAT, knowing that this procedure is
129 probably the first step to hanging yourself and as an excuse the Union
130 can use for not being of assistance.  And I'm sure the great lawyers on
131 the board helped design it for them so that nothing too much can be pinned
132 of THEM either.  But since that evaluation included some totally unbeliev-
133 able and illegal ADDED REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES that the Union 
134 SHOULD HAVE looked into but didn't, I **MIGHT** have been interesting to
135 have a written opinion by Jerry Morford.  If it's anything like the copy
136 of a letter he'd sent to the Union regarding the selection of Bill Beck as
137 my hearings officer (he was newly married to Candi above), it would have
138 probably been a further excellent example of BESC administrative attitudes.
139 (That should probably be ESC; it appears from administrative stationery 
140 they want to drop BLANCHARD usage now.)
141  
142 But the excitement doesn't end there, but I'll cover that later.  Maybe 
143 after I got into some earlier history ... maybe Eleanor's problems with
144 two previous secretaries in the same department ... or maybe my experiences
145 with Word Processing ... or their experiences with the Evaluation Department
146 or mine with Walt Hathaway.

192 one as well. I can't believe you think your words are no good. They're

195 Top 40 style music! :-) But once I've gotten further into the business
196 (if I do) I'll be sure to do some different styles because you're pretty
197 much safe to mess around a little *after* you've made your mark in the

199 to type them over on another sheet of paper just to have 'em somewhere

215 Go ahead and copy them.  Its not much good to create if you never
216 let other people see what you are doing.
217  
218 As for the quality, I kind'of like the last one I entered.  My main problem
219 with the stuff I do is that it all tends to be on a couple of differant
220 themes, or just semi-meaningless.  Also, everything I say has been said
221 before, and no doubt better.
222  
223 Not all Top-40 type music is bad.  I do get really sick of poorly done 
224 love songs though.  We're a culture obsessed with the perfect 
225 relationship, when to ofteen we can't even stand ourselves.

232 But before I got into the life and times of Word Processing, let me
233 begin with the end.  After several unpleasant run-ins with Sharon
234 Clouser about such things as her maintaining yet ANOTHER rather unfair
235 "Personnel File" or work deadlines or being able to find documents/
236 putting document #s on work, etc., I was told in an oral evaluation
237 review I'd have a better personality if I had breast implants.  When 
238 the other person in the review replied she didn't think it was a good
239 idea because she had a friend who'd had implants that popped and caused
240 no end of trouble, Sharon turned somewhat white.  I'd never really given
241 it any thought, much less discussed it with anybody, but Sharon did 
242 start wearing rather tight sweaters shortly after a purport district
243 travel seminar.

248 Thanks AD. I'm going to type them now. The last one you entered is the one
249 I really like as well. It has a lot of feelings in it - a sense of hope
250 and despair, promise, etc. I don't know how to explain it. As for all your
251 stuff being done before (and "better" as you say) you shouldn't compare
252 your work to others becuase your stuff is unique - you are the only one
253 who has written those words *exactly* like you've written them - and with
254 the same emotions no doubt. I like Top-40 *music* mostly but you're right
255 the words are lame most of the time. Especially the love songs. They seem
256 so rushed and cliched all the time. With my songs I try to make the music
257 the really outstanding part - and just as long as the words fit okay and
258 *sound* good with the music, they don't really matter 'cause no one (in
259 their right mind) really pays that much attention to dumb words anyway.
260 Although I do have a few love songs I try to write honestly but I haven't
261 had too much experience to I give in to cliches sometimes..Oh well, i

270  
271 TV, thanks for the feedback. 
272  
273 On the subject of Top-40, I only listen to the words when I'm really
274 bored.  And then I get bored fast.  When I first get a new record, I
275 listen to the music mostly.  But as time goes on, I start to listen 
276 to the words.  If they aren't interesting, I stop listening.
277  
278 Some examples of really good Top-40 type music with fairly good lyrics 
279 follow.
280  
281 The Graces - Perfect View.  This group is primarily the work of Charlotte 
282 Caffey, Who played Lead Guitar for the Go-Go's, and wrote a lot of their
283 music.  She also did a lot o work on the first two Belinda Carlisle
284 albums (Belinda was the Go-Gos lead singer.)  Heres an example of the
285 lyrics.  This is from the title track.
286  
287 ...You stare at the moon
288 then the music starts
289 The radio plays a song
290 for broken hearts.
291  
292 Your eyes turn a deep shade of blue
293 You can try but you can't hide the truth
294 I'm on the outside looking right into you
295 Its a perfect view.
296  
297 Thats just a bit of the the song.  I love most of the lyrics on this album,
298 and the music is really great.  It has a slight C&W influence, but is 
299 definetly Top-40 material.  
300  
301 For some reason the album bombed though.  You can pick up the CD used for
302 around $8.
303  
304 Jane Wiedlin - Tangled.  Jane was the Rythm Guitarist for the Go-Go's, and
305 wrote a lot of their music.  Including _Our lips are sealed,part of 
306 _Vacation_, and a bunch of other stuff.  
307  
308 Tangled is Janes third Solo album, andits really really good.  I have the
309 second one as well (_Fur_) and don't like it nearly as much.
310  
311 Heres a line from one of the songs.  (_Rain on me_)
312  
313 I can feel the flood is coming
314 It'll make the world a sea
315 But I could spend forever 
316 diving just you and me
317  
318 Yea, its a love song, but the poetry is really great in spots.  This album
319 came out last year and also bombed.  Can be had for $8.  The style is 
320 very popish, with a good dance grove on many of the tracks.
321  
322 I also have all three Belinda Carlisle albums, and I'd have to say they
323 are fairly mediocre.  Even the stuff written by Caffey (a good 
324 portion of the first two.)  is not well presented.  I feel Belinda
325 has a really weak voice.  Little emotion, and not much range.
326  
327 As you can see, I'm a bit of a Go Go's fan.  Sort of a guilty pleasure.
328 :-)
329  
330 I also like Tom Petty a lot, but he's not really Top-40 sounding.  Same
331 goes for the traveling wilberries.  Really non top 40 bands that I like
332 are The Sugar Cubes, Concrete Blond, Pylon, Camper Van Bethoven, and
333 They Might be giants.
334  
335 Well, I've blathered on long enough.  I'll close with a short poem.
336  
337 Something said in shorthand
338 A table with a view
339  
340 A future of tommorows
341 and so I hide from you
342  
343 Another tired song
344 The words that walk on by
345  
346 Got to find the future
347 I'm looking to the sky.

354 As all of PPS knows, Sharon Clouser has had serious and continuous prob-
355 lems with both employees and users since she "stole" the department from
356 Chris Blackburn.  And even though she DID tearfully apologize for the
357 implant incident and begged me not to report it to the Union, I told her
358 I thought she'd been messing with too many lives and didn't realize the
359 far-reaching impact of her attitudes and behavior on the district, commun-
360 ity or the University <grin> (I didn't REALLY include the universe, but it
361 does).  And not only did I report it to the Union, but I talked t Don
362 McElroy as well, since he was her former boss and current supervisor and,
363 no doubt, had GIVEN her "the Word Processing Department."  But to add
364 insult to injury, Donnie dared to usher me out of his office with his 
365 arm around me gurgling "so sorry sweetheart" or some such thing.  As it
366 ended up, between Personnel, McElroy and the Union, my firing over this
367 incident was rescinded but probably only to avoid having a hearing dealing
368 with it since there WAS a witness.  Of course, the Union didn't see to it
369 that I received another placement and I ended up on unemployment for not
370 long enough to recover, and they STILL didn't help when the unemployment
371 ran out and I was forced to participate in the substitute pool for almost
372 six months, until the Curriculum Department went against District
373 "statutes" ***AND THE UNION*** and actually HIRED me.  (Judy Hyde received
374 her "just rewards" for this action a few years later.)  All in all, I
375 don't know WHAT I would have done if I'd been a single mother with kids ...
376 MENTALLY OR FINANCIALLY, which is something Randi always seems to BRING
377 UP but never DOES ANYTHING ABOUT.  Which is precisely why OTHER Word
378 Processing staff never felt abl to stand up to Sharon even years later, 
379 and probably even to this day ... to say nothing of the fear of an even 
380 WORSE supervisor should they complain about Sharon (I think transferring
381 principals every 2-4 years is an extension of this tactic.)
382  
383 Unfortunately, when I shockingly found the sam sort of terrorist tactics
384 being utilized by Avis Austad and Bev Granata in Curriculum, I was told
385 BY SOME (and ESPECIALLY the EAP) I was naive and idealistic, that I
386 should wake up and realize nothing could ever be done because it's REALITY
387 evertwhere ... maybe even WORSE "elsewhere."  Well, that always really
388 pissed me off and I always said that schools are somewhat responsible for
389 "socialization" and many attitudes and behaviors are incubated and per-
390 petuated there, so if anyone should START reform it SHOULD be the schools.
391  
392 The REAL truth about Curriculum though, was that those 2-3 secretaries 
393 were able t act with impunity because they were zealous union members ...
394 you note they were all prominently feature in advertising brochures
395 when union representation came up for the last vote.  (I include Janet
396 Dyrhaug even though she had previously been gang raped while working w/
397 Bev in TAG under the supervision of Sue Parker, again when working
398 opposite Avis for a horrible year in Curriculum and, to escape the
399 ridiculously inequitable workload in Curriculum, tried another terrible
400 year with Sue and w/o Bev when Sue was made a principle, and when that
401 turned out horrble, returned to Curriculum when Avis left and proceeded
402 instigate gang rape against Janice Gabriel, who had already been involved
403 in a rape situation with Susan Larsen [my union rep] at another location
404 ... from what I understand from Susan, she actually cracked up, which 
405 may be the reason she now works for the Union.  She now says she can't
406 even IMAGINE being a secretary again; and you'd better believe her folks).

409 I think this all was about the time Carlos Taylor got cancer and almost 
410 died.  And if I tracked it right from what Janice intermittently revealed,
411 she ALSO had severe difficulties, which seemed to set off a chain reaction
412 in her personal life (just guessing on that one).  After Carlos came back
413 from not dying, McElroy appointed him to head Curriculum, even though he
414 had not applied for the position, didn't WANT it, and the district had done
415 an extensive/expensive WORLD search.  Of course, most people thought that
416 the person who was acting director for all that time would eventually be
417 appointed, and when that didn't happen all hell broke loose ... once again.

420 And Linda Simington's mom was brought in to replace Carlos as Lincoln/
421 Roosevelt(?) DOI.  I think Linda, at that time, was "principal on special
422 assignment" at Wilson DOI, and Linda's father a principal somewhere else.
423 As Janice had been Carlos' secretary and wasn't sure of Mildred Wait and
424 the problems involving both her and Susan had probably not been solved, she
425 hd Carlos transfer her to CD&S.  
426  
427 And as Rich had quit after not being appointed Curriculum Director, Avis
428 also "transferred."  And because Judy Hyde then got her "just reward" wa
429 and was also "transferred" out and not replaced, another secretary from
430 CD&S was "forced" out ... by decree from Nancy Eliot, no less.  So we had
431 one big game of musical chairs.  Janice moved from Terwillinger to Brooklyn,
432 Katherine moved from Brooklyn to Terwilliger; Sandy moved from Student 
433 Services to the Ad Bldg as secretary to Carlos (instead of Rich) and Avis
434 went to Student Services, to become Secretary of the Year the very next
435 year.

438 And to complicate matters even worse, Carlos had probably worked with
439 Randi in Personnel because, I was told, Carlos was brought in after
440 Dr. Blanchard died to control personnel.  I think this is about the
441 time Randi arrived from out of town to become a secretary there ... 
442 whether or not for Carlos, I don't know.  But Randi is the one who
443 ultimately "saved" Susan from "insanity" at Terwilliger (and from
444 secretarialhood) and she's been with the Union ever since.

448 AD - I also am a fan of the Go-Go's! - except I like Belinda Carlisle a
449 bit more than you. I think she has really a pretty good voice. Her range
450 may be bad but I haven't noticed. I have all three of her solo works as
451 well. I really like "Runaway Horses". I think it's her best so far. It
452 had a Top-40 hit I believe - "Leave A Light On" but otherwise pretty much
453 bombed. I haven't even heard of "The Graces" but you've got me interested.
454 Those lyrics sounded good. I think I'll check it out!
455 Jane Weidlin's "Fur" is good. I like "Rush Hour" I believe it was a Top-10
456 hit back in 1988 or so...I don't remember exaclty. I've only heard one
457 song from her album "Tangles" - wait, actually two. I heard the first
458 release "World on Fire" and found it kind of weird and annoying but I
459 only heard it once and music can definitely grow on you! I also have the
460 "Pretty Woman" soundtrack (but I hated the movie) and the song "Tangled"
461 is on it and I enjoy it. She has a good voice. Her music sounds just like
462 Carlisle's solo work though, I must say but it's a good sound so that's
463 o.k. The Go-Go's had a reunion recently did you go see them in concert??
464 I heard it was really good!
465 I like Tom Petty a lot too. "Full Moon Fever" has given me many hours of
466 enjoyment though I think I've exhausted it by now and I'll throw up if
467 I hear it ever again (you never know though) :) It may not sound Top-40
468 but it definitely had Top-40 hits like "I Won't Back Down" and "Runnin'
469 Down A Dream". You know, Top-40 isn't all *that* bad - new styles seem
470 to be making their way into the Top-40, adding some diversity - for exam-
471 ple, R.E.M. has been in the Top-40 quite a bit w/"Stand" (although thy
472 said it was their worst song - but it's funny that I like it the best)
473 and a new one "Shiny happy People" which is very annoying (but in the
474 Top-40 nonetheless.) I like Concrete Blond's song "Joey" and I think
475 it was a Top-40 hit (I may be wrong though but I swear I heard it once
476 on Z100! :) I like Camper Van Bethoven as well - one song that stuck
477 out when I heard their whole album (I don't recall which it was) was
478 "Matchstick man" or something like that. It was cool. I have "Flood" by
479 They Might Be Giants. It's wierd but good alternative stuff. I'm not
480 much of an alternative music fan but TMBG are an exception. "Birdhouse
481 in your soul" is why I bought the tape. It's a good song w/some good
482 lyrics as well.
483 Wow! I'm blabbing as well. See ya later...oh, and I liked that poem
484 you put on the end of your entry. It fits your name for the board...

489  
490 TV, I prefer Belindas second album, but havn't really listened to numbers
491 one and three enought to be sure yet.  When I said she had poor range, I
492 think I meant emotional.  I just don't think she expresses herself 
493 very well emotionally.  This could be because she doesn't write much
494 of her material, in fact, close to none.
495  
496 I heard about te reunion, and would have loved to see them in concert, but
497 they never came around here as far as I know.  I just hope they put 
498 out another album.  They've all gotten much better since they broke up.
499  
500 I just got FUR, (On album, I havn't been able to find the CD yet.)  Last
501 night, so I havn't really listened to it enough to be sure, but I really
502 think that tangled is better.  World on fire is the track I ussually 
503 skip over.  
504  
505 Definetly check out The Graces, I like it a lot, I feel it is the best 
506 work any of the Go Go's have done.
507  
508 REM's success has been a surprise.  As you may remember, I've been
509 a fan of theirs for a long time.  Their latest is their best effort in
510 a long time.  Shiny happy people is obnoxios, but it is meant to be.
511 The rest of he album has some really great popish songs.  The best
512 being _Belong_ which is to me by far the best thing they have ever
513 done.  Great harmonies, and the most emotionally moving song 
514 they have ever done.  They sort of step into U2's yard, and kick
515 some serious butt.  (in terms of song quality and execution.)
516  
517 REMs music is very simple in terms of chord progressions.  
518 _The One I Love_ for instance is mostly Em and D, while
519 _Driver 8_  is mostly Em Am G G9(That last one may be wrong.) and
520 D C, with the bridge being something like Am C Am G (Probably 
521 mostly wrong.)  Anyway, very simple progressions.  Whats interesting
522 about them is that none of the instruments are played like you'de
523 expect. ofteen the bass will carry the melody, while the guitar
524 provides much of the rythm, and the drums just sort of blend into
525 the background.  The lead vocal then carries the melody, and 
526 sometimes the bass line.  They definetly have their own sound.
527  
528  
529 The problem with TMBG is that all their songs really do sound the same.
530 On the plus side is their lyrics, which are ofteen funny, as well as
531 being though provoking.  I have all three of their albums.  Actually,
532 they do do an ocasional melodic song that sounds differant from their
533 ussual stuff.  I'll have to listen to them again.  Its been awhile.
534  
535 I ussually buy an album, listen to it about two dozen times, and then
536 ignore it for a month or two.

546 deference to the people who haven't seen it yet.  I also thought the ending 
547 scene had more gore for gore's sake than necessary.  And there were other
548 anomolies in the staging.  But I din't realise until the credits that both
549 parts were Brannaugh's.  The use of B&W was good in that respect.

559 You're right. Belinda could use a bit more emotion in her voice. It seems
560 kind of mechanical now that I think about it. I can't believe someone can
561 make it so big w/out even writing their own songs! That's pretty weak if
562 you as me.
563 Yes, I remember you *love* REM. I think I'll go but _Out of Time_. I may
564 think "Shiny Happy People" is obnoxious, but I still like it. And "Losing
565 My Religion" is good too. I want to hear this song "Belong" that you talk-
566 ed about as well. If there's at least three good songs on an album, I be-
567 lieve it's worth checking out.
568 (Oh, BTW I think U2 sucks!)
569 REM has a good sound - that's pretty creative what they've done with their
570 arrangements that you mentioned. It's definitely original. Not enough ar-
571 tists out there are willing to go beyond what is "written" in music. It's
572 good that REM is creative enough to do so.
573 I noticed as well that TMBG's songs sound pretty much the same, but then
574 again, I've only heard "Flood" so I can't really talk :)
575 To Friar - I'm glad you liked "Dead Again." The ending may have been over-
576 done but I'll bet it made you a little tense though! ;) I didn't have the
577 whodunit part figured out at all until it was revealed. That was a total
578 shock for me! I guess you're a bit more perceptive that I am. Branagh did
579 a great job, huh? He's a very talented actor and director, I'm surprised
580 I hadn't seen or heard of him until this film. We need more British film-
581 makers (I happen to be fascinated by England and its people). Have you 
582 seen and previous work of his before "Dead Again"? If this is his first
583 film, then he really hit the mark and has a strong future ahead of him.
584 His wife did a great job as well. Oh - Robin Williams was *great* huh :)
585 Good to see you agree w/me on this one and hey if you see any films be
586 sure to write a little review! I for one know you have good taste ;)
587 Later...Oh, AD BTW do you think Kate Pierson (the lady from the B-52's)
588 was a good choice for "Shiny Happy People?" I used to like the B-5's and
589 saw them in concert but they get annoying pretty quick. Just wondering
590 about your opinion....See Ya!

596 TMBG:  Hotel detective sounds differant, as does _Shes an Angel.  If it comes
597 to that, there is a lot of variety on their first album.  Its just the
598 last couple that have sounded a bit stale.  Not bad, just not as good as the
599 re first effort.  Of course, finding that first album is probably a minor
600 chalenge.  I have the CD, and a 3.5 inch cd single that has _Don't lets Start_
601 and a few non album tracks.  I bought when they first came out though.
602  
603 Kate Pierson:  I think she was the only choice.  She's origionally from
604 Athens GA, and vocally nobody else would have worked.  She also does
605 backing vocals on a song calle _Me in Honey_ on OOT.  Which I also like
606 a lot BTW.  Though it is extremly simple musicly.
607  
608 The B52's:  I have all their albums.  They do get a bit old after awhile, 
609 but I still enjoy them.  I'd say my favorites are _Bouncing off the
610 Satilites_ and _Wild Planet_.  I used to like _Cosmic thing_, but 
611 I've gotten really sick of hearing most of it on the radio.  I bought
612 CT when it first came out too.  I have this tendancy to be about
613 one to 6 years ahead of the general public when it comes to

758 sure seems like it would've been easier to just chop ALL the DOIs
759 instead of the one ... and wasn't it the Voc Ed DOI that was chopped
760 just when it's relevance is being discussed???  Seems odd.
761  
762 Wonder when they'll announce the $1million administrative cuts.
763  
764 The list doesn't seem that precise though.  Does Evaluation have 25
765 people total or 25 FTE @ $40,000 a compared to Curriculum with only 12.

770 Lady-Thanx for the clarification.
771  
772 Vision-I will post some works soon but the novel, lesson plans for fall,
773 and the new bbs are taking up a lot of time.  Even bbsing has suffered.
774 I have had a few friends proof what I have written and their only critique
775 is that I use more description and setting.  New style is all.  I am too used
776 to saying it all efficiently.  Also, 2400 baud is now enabled on Grizzly's 
777 Den.  I forgot to initialize 2400 in my command string so the software was
778 going to the default 1200.  Now I have to make it admit the modem is 
779 receiving numeric result codes.
780  
781 All-Anyone with knowlege of updated versions of Colossus BBS software please
782 let me know.  The version I am running was written in 1985 and is a literal
783 dinosaur.

795 Griz: If it's any help I think the BBS has turned out great! I've called just
796 a couple of times but have found the set-up and formats really well-done.
797 For somebody who is working on so many things at once you've sure done a
798 good job running a BBS! :) I'm going to call The Griz Den more often. As
799 for the stories; I'm anticipating! :) It's a great talent to be a writer.
800 As for the novel, good luck! That would be great if it was published! It's
801 like w/my music...if you work hard anything is possible. So what's the 
802 novel about? (If you don't mind telling, that is). Also, tell me more about
803 your teaching, eg. what do you teach, etc? Hope you're having a good week-
804 end...see ya!
805 ___Movie Review Time!______________________"Defenseless"_______***1/2_______
806 I am giving this movie three and a half stars mainly because of two things:
807 The story and the acting (mostly for Barbara Hershey's *awesome* perfor-
808 mance). This is a tough one. I thought "Dead Again" was the best thriller
809 so far this year but "Defenseless" is pretty close. This movie was great.
810 The story is very complicated and full of surprises. The ending is not cli-
811 ched...it's realistic and honest. It reminded me a little bit of "Fatal
812 Attraction"'s climactic finale but was much better. Another good this is
813 that there are scenes before the end of the film that are just as good as
814 the climax. It's a well-acted and thought-out thriller that is doing very
815 poorly at the Box Office (tell me why?) but is a *must-see*. The little
816 advertisement tag is "...The only thing more shocking than the murder it-
817 self was the motive" and that's very true. The motives are unexpected and
818 surprising as well as realistic and honest. The style and photography is
819 good and the pacing is good/quick as well. By the time the murderer is re-
820 vealed you've thought of everything but just can't pin it all down. It's
821 practically impossible to predict and therefore fun. Well, enough talking
822 about it - just go see it!!

825 As my eyes roll and hit the back of my head,
826      all light disappears...
827 The "Twilight Zone" has overcome my conscious reasoning
828      and I see visions of the future and past flying past me
829           at accelerated rates.
830 I can still hear distant sound from the outer realms of my imagination,

840 Re the Evaluation department:  To the best of my knowledge, Curiculam is
841 JUST Curiculam.  What your refer to as the Evaluation department is actually
842 the Research AND Evaluation department.  Also, there is the Test development
843 unit, the test ops unit, as well as clerical staff who float back and 
844 forth depending were the need. is.  WE ARE NOT OVER STAFFED.  In fact, we
845 lost two program evaluation positions, leaving us with 2, I believe these
846 people are responsible for proving to various government organizations that
847@ 
848 we are doing the things the law requires us to do.  There is ofteen large
849 sums of money at stack.  We are ofteen over worked and understaffed, and
850 new demands are being placed upon us all the time, making things worse.
851  
852 Note, this is meerly my opinion, and I have no authority within the 
853 department.  I will note again that your constant tirades against the
854 evaluation department have long since gotten old.  Especially in light
855 of the fact that you never respond to me when I point out your
856 misconceptions and outright lies.

859 let us know when it comes out though.

889   Brush strokes done in gray
890   An image of the play
891   Upon the stage.
892  
893   Move on too picture two
894   And paint an image of you
895   Are you a happy one?
896  
897   The subject is at hand
898   The image made up of the sand
899   that trickles through my hand.
900  
901   A cavern made of steel holds them all
902   The pictures on the wall
903  
904   Held there by our hardened thoughts
905   and the preasures they entail.

941 Its sort of strange for me to say this, but I think I'm finally starting
942 to understand the beauty of poetry.  To be honoust, I've had a habbit
943 of bellitling it in the past.  But the older I get, and the more I read,
944 the better I understand the whole concept.
945  
946 When I write, I really am trying to paint a picture with words.  Its
947 not really like any other sort of writting.  Its something very 
948 differant.  In the past, I've had a tendancy to look at poetry as
949 I would anything else.  I have in fact been selectivly filtering the
950 best parts.  
951  
952 But the more I write, and the more I read, the more I understand.
953  
954 PL:  Endings have always been a problem.  I get three or so verses in,
955      and I lose my train of thought.  My muse has a very short fuse.

963 To All-
964      Recently in the news those sharks of journalisms have their teeth set 
965 in yet another family with enough on their minds.  What I am talking about 
966 is the families of David Jay Rudge and Diane Walden, both missing since I 
967 left work at 6:25pm Friday August 30th.  Why do I care?  Diane Walden is my
968 aunt but she and my Uncle Jerry have been like parents since receiving guard-
969 ianship of me in 1981.  The Oregroanian has done such a wonderful job at
970 talented tabloid journalism, that the police file has been declaired off limits
971 to all press agencies and even the families involved have a harder time getting
972 a straight answer.  Not that it matters, the police have been thinking hard on 
973 the matter at DunDunkin' Doughnuts.  When they are done eating free day-olds, 
974 they might go out and do something useful.  Jerry, I and the rest of the 
975 Kinderland staff had enough to do with the first day of school an fielding
976 questions from concerned parents.  Chasing the press away and telling
977 private investigators to go look in someone elses garbage only added to the 
978 stress.  What is this message all about?  I'm not sure myself.  I think I'm
979 just rambling on.  I'm just asking all users out there to help let these 
980 agencies know they are not doing their job.

985 Well folks, the poetry disk is about done.  ( I didn't name it, it showed up
986 above. :) )  This disk was here for some of the most interesting times in 
987 post war history, from the coup to the flattening of the coup.  I think that
988 the American people and the journalists are making an historical mistake when
989 they denigrate the contributions of Mikhail Gorbachev.  I have heard him 
990 described as a "transitional figure" who could do nothing more than he did, 
991 or as a "tragic buffoon" who did his best to stand in the way of progress. 
992 I think he was an enlightened visionary, seeing the way to bring the Soviet
993 Union out of the dark and into the light of free enterprise and world
994 partnerships.  He knew that his plan might eventually grow to overcome him,
995 but felt that the eventual outcome was worth the loss of his power, even his
996 life.  What more can we ask of an historical figure, that he give up his own
997 best self interest for the interest of his people and their future.
998 Mikhail Gorbachev, I salute you.
