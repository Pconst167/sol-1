 35          30,000 animals suffer a lingering and agonising death in
 36 steel-toothed traps each year to provide skins for the fur trade. The
 37 number who escape (usually by biting off the crushed and infected
 38 leg), or are discarded, probably swell this figure to 100,000,000.
 39  
 40 To make JUST ONE FUR COAT will require the slaughter of one of the
 41 following groups:
 42                 12 baby ocelots
 43                 15 lynx                 These figures represent
 44                 25 oppossums              hundreds of hours of

 46                 65 mink
 47  
 48 Trapped animals die in the following ways:
 49         Exposure -which can take weeks or even months; a combination
 50 of pain, terror and blood loss; being eaten by a predator; having
 51 their heads smashed in by the trappers' clubs.

 65 nation's trappers are professionals, while the fur industry employs
 66 only 5000 people nationwide.
 67          Non-target animals are also victimized by trappers' tools.
 68 These "trash" animals, according to Dept of Interior figures, con-
 69 stitute as much as 67% of the total catch, and include domestic
 70 animals such as dogs and cats.
 71          Of course, not all animals slaughtered for their pelts are
 72 caught in traps. Some are raised on "ranches" in a way similar to
 73 factory-farmed food animals, except that there are no federal regula-
 74 tions regarding humane treatmnent and no inspection of facilities.
 75 There is also far less incentive for a fur rancher to concern himself
 76 with the physical and psychological well-being of his animals since
 77 this does not, for the most part, affect the quality of the fur. 
 78 Compulsive movements, self-mutilation and symptoms of neurotic
 79 behavior are evident in many of these animals.
 80         The suffering entailed by strict confinement in small, wire
 81 cages is compounded by genetic manipulation of fur-bearing animals to
 82 produce variant or more "desirable" fur.  This is evident in minks,
 83 who often suffer from abnormal spasms of the neck, and, in the case of 
 84 females, contraction of the uterus, resulting in pain and high
 85 frequency of miscarriage in giving birth.
 86         Disease is also a common problem on fur ranches, as in factory 
008=Usr:0 Null User         06/30/87 20:34  Msg:0 Call:0  Lines:19
 87 farms, but to a greater degree, due in large part ot the stress
 88 resulting from intensive confinement.  Unfortunately, there is less
 89 incentive to prevent and treat disease, as the edibility of the
 90 animal's flesh is not in question.
 91         Inhumane killing methods are yet another source of suffering
 92 on fur ranches.  Furbearers are not protected by the federal Humane
 93 Slaughter Act.  Methods commonly used to kill minks include the
 94 poison, strychnine, which causes the animals to suffocate; primitive
 95 electrocution in which the current does not pass through the brain,
 96 and hence causes acute suffering before death; and the use of uncooled and 
 97 unfiltered carbon monoxide gas, which can cause severe burning and
 98 distress in the lungs.
 99  
100 PLEASE HELP!

102 slaughtered for the sake of fashion, please join SACA and TSU in doing 
103 something about it:

158 A fourth dimensional shake would be one where the movement and meaning was
159 dependent on time.   Thusly it could mean "yes" at one point of time and
160 "no" at another point.   This shake would be inconclusive and I think

192 There is a method of losing fat that is used by virtually every body builder
193 and many other professional atheletes.  This method can purge your body of
194 up to 50% of your body fat in just six days.  The method is called loading
195 and fasting and it works by changing the normal metabolic condition of burn-
196 ing carbohydrates first and then burning protein and fat into burning fat
197 first and then carbos.  The term "loading and fasting" describes what your
198 are doing to your carbohydrate count, not food in general.  Here is a step
199 by step explanation on how to do it:
200 1) For the first two days take nothing but protein.  Limit your fat and
201    carbo intake to no more than 5 grams.  Some ideal foods to eat are egg
202    whites, tuna, black cod.  Drink only water.  Take vitamin B tablets.
203 2) The third day, eat nothing.  But take vitamin C tablets to prevent from
204    getting sick.  You will have to do a hardcore workout on this day.  The
205    workout should be at least 4 hours in length.  Running, biking, weight-
206    training will work well.  Drink only water.
207 3) The fourth day your body will have all carbos spent.  This is a magic
208    day.  Your body will begin burning fat for fuel.  Avoid protein on this
209    day or it will cancel your efforts.  Take in carbos only, no fat or
210    protein.  Your body will still burn fat but will store the carbos away
211    for future supply.  Note that this is the opposite of normal metabolism.
212 4) For the next two days your body will continue to burn fat for energy
213    instead of carbos.  This is only if you avoid protein and fats and get
019=Usr:0 Null User         06/30/87 20:34  Msg:0 Call:0  Lines:38
214    all your calories from carbohydrates.  Some recommended foods: Fruit
215    and fruit juice, soft drinks, pasta.
216 5) On the seventh day, your body may contain up to 85% surplus carbos.
217    This is more than your body could normally hold and you will have great
218    energy.  Long distane runners often use "loading and fasting" starting
219    seven days before a big race to give them energy levels otherwise
220    impossible to obtain.  On this day your body will revert back to normal
221    metabolism and burn these carbohydrates for energy and store fat.

238 The meal with the monks of the monastastary was a quit one. I looked around
239 the table and noticed that many of the faces had passed from youth to
240 middle age. The monks had always celabrated th glories of the multi-verse.
241 But now there was an air in the room that made me realize that in a few
242 years the monks would no longer be celabrating.
243  
244 I was saddened by this for a moment but then I remembered the cyclic nature
245 of the universe. 
246  
247 Having finished my meal I asked of the monks the werabouts of the dancing one.

383    Aum Shiva.
384  
385    I closed the Eye and opened my eyes.
386  
387    I was "floating in outer space", with "millions of twinkling lights".
388  
389    Then I noticed a sound near the door.  Almost like a large mole was
390 going by.  Could someone have checked a room out?
391

392    This would have to wait.  I snapped my fingers, and the "Outer Space"
393 surrondings were replaced by the White Room,  small, plain room with
394 1 door.  The "Outer Space" was an illusion created for my entertainment.
395 That, plus it helps set the mood for meditation.  I could create any
396 surroundings I wished; a war zone, a glade with a waterfall nearby, the
397 surface of Mars, anything.  The effect was good for the size of the room-
398 after that, you hit the walls.  I liked my private room.
399  
400    Floating down stairs, I asked JT to reserve a room for Friar,
401 several dimensions from now.
402  
403    The Eye had reveiled a time stream.  (Why not,) I thought, (I do
404 need to step out and look around...)
405  
406    I re-opened the Eye and moved accross dimensions, many of which were
407 small, but a few were turbulent.  Probably from the wormhole leading to
408 the Gateway.  Seems as if I have some fine-tuneing to do...
409  
410    As I closed the Eye, I appeared in front of Friar, Kurfur, & Wonderer.

593    Two others arrived, strangers, but my previous masters reared in my head,
594 reminding me that all people are people, and stranger is a word for someone
595 whom you have not met until now.  I smiled, and rotated to greet them.
596  
597    Rayall, Kaitlyn, welcome to Friar's quest.  I am Hagbard Celine, resident
598 Guru & patron of the Inn.  Come, tell us how you live - I would like to know
599 you better as friends.  What do you do best?  And what would you like to
600 eat along the way?  Oh, and don't feel too ill-at-ease around Wonderer or I,
601 as we periodically do things that are unsightly.  Wonderer possesses Magik of
602 his own teaching; I possess an Elightened Mind, which allows me to alter my
603 reality.  Kurfur is a powerful adversary with any foe, for he uses the
604 Beserkergang.  Friar is a special case - he blends the powers of all three,
605 but to a lesser degree -and I'm sure he has more that he hasn't shown to us
606 yet.  All of us are dimension travellers, old and new.  Where this time
607 flow is, I do not know.
608  
609    Friar, I've made reservations at the Inn upon your return.  I think you
610 should consider becoming a patron - Wonderer and Kurfur are both patrons,
611 as well as I.  The Inn has been moved, and slightly(?) modified.  But this
612 is for the journey home - I should concentrate on the task at hand.
613  
614    (You old fart!  Your mind is wanderering again!  Do you not remember what
615 it cost you and your friends on the last adventure?  Be aware of your
616 surroundings, least you attract the Dark Ones to your mindlessness!) and
617 my mind stopped screaming to itself, and gave forgiveness, for my inner
618 self must be whole if I was to continue to alter my surroundings.  It was
619 the one weakness that could destroy me with ease - and the mark of a human.
620  
621    Kurfur, it's good to have you around again!  I thought you were at the
622 Inn, nursing that Keg of Mead.  Where did you go? - I was distracting
623 myself in the White Room, allowing for a rest from my Structural Work around
624 the Inn...
625  
626    Wonderer, how did your quest turn out?  Did you find what you were
627 seeking?
628  
629    And so "the talk" began, which would eventually lead to "the adventure".

634 Hi!  I'm a little out of breath but I will tell you a bit about myself.
635 I'm just a little kid(about 18) who happens to be a history gypsy.  See
636 most gypsies can tell the future, but I believe I'm cursed to tell only
637 the past.  So due to my condition, I left the gypsy camp and set about wanderin
638 No one seems to want anyone who can name all the presidents, but I have
639 learned in my wanderings several languages, and a small amount of magic,
640 so I'll be happy to donate my skills to the quest.
641 Oh, well, I'll unload my history crystal ball and be back later!

655    Kaitlyn stood and observed, for the first (and the last, she hoped)
656 time, a guru doing summersalts in a sideways direction.  I was laughing so
657 hard, I lost my shape and colapsed into a sphere.  Haveing laughing object
658 that look like, well, compressed people, can, well, disturb you.
659  
660    Momentarily regaining some of my shape, I oozed (sorry Kurfur, I know
661 how you hate it when I'm liquid) some words out:
662  
663    "Young?!?!??  HeeHeeHooHooHaHaHahahahahahahaaha!  Don't be a stranger!
664 Most of us are not exactly "ancient"!  I do believe," regaining my orginal
665 'floating man-in-robes' shape "the average age here is in the lower twenties
666 (correct me if I'm wrong, folks).  Jeez, I'm barely 20!  Was 19 when I
667 arrived here!"
668  
669    "Don't be upset by my laughter - it's just, well, funny!  I never thought
670 of myself as "mature" or "older".  Eighteen isn't that bad - in fact, I think
671 it's great!  Brings some good (and bad) memories back from a "recent" time!
672 A toast!" with several stiens of mead appearing "to your youth and good
673 outlook!  May it never leave you, and may it be stronger when you need it!"
674 (Yup, Kurfur, your stien is slightly larger - but not too large.  We need you
675 to at least stay awake).  "Friar!  My good friend, methinks it time to
676 have a small feast.  If you need more than what you have at the moment, I
677 would be glad to assist you, and I'm sure Wonderer will be able to help
678 with the feast as well!  There lies a long, trecherous journey ahead, so
679 let us make merry for this short time, and then set forth in search of our

705 Well, Hagbard, I think the magic of the pouch can handle a feast.
706 So saying, I squeezed the bottom corners of the pouch and drew the
707 open mouth along the table Hagbard had materialized.
708 A feast it was!  Ham, roast beast, turkey, poached salmon in dill
709 sauce, and assorted fruits and vegetables.
710 "Tap a Keg of Honey Wine, there, Kaitlyn, would you please?  You'll
711 find them floating in the shade of that tree.  No, in the air. 
712 They're easier to move that way."
713 "Well gents and ladies?  Since Kurfur appears to have been at the
714 mead already, is anyone interested in the details of the quest we
715 are on?  I cn't say all of the details of what will happen, I can 
716 only relate why we are going.  For in spite of what my friend and
717 companion Hagbard says, I am sure I have lived longer than most of
718 you, and perhaps seen things some of you have not."
719 If everyone will grab a place at the table, *****SSSNNNNOOORRREEEE****
720 Will someone turn Kurfur off of his back please!
721 Now, as I was saying, if everyone has a place, and wants to hear, I
722 will begin the story.

748 ------- Yeah I know... However as it was pounded into my head after each
749 ------- long day of exshusting work, "A GOOD wizard does not rely solely
750 ------- upon Magik". At which point I would fall asleep listening to a
751 ------- lenghty adventure that illustrated the saying.
752 ------- Anyhow, after two weeks, the Wizard packed several bag, pointed
753 ------- to a small red sphere and said, "If anything happens to me that
754 ------- globe will glow bright red. It is very doutfull but just in case
755 ------- take that sword, and find another Wizard." After saying this he
756 ------- levatated the bags, himself and disappeared into the sky.
757 ------- After a few days the globe started gloig a bright red. I took
758 ------- the sword down from its wall mount and the globe flared a very
759 ------- blinding red. I was standing in the forest where the Wizard's
760 ------- house used to be, holding a sword, looking puzzled and somewhat
761 ------- sad. All I could take was a few days of scavaging in the forest
762 ------- for food. I counted my gold coins so I could visit as many inn

768   "Where the ^%&^%*& did this table come from?" I inquired of the group
769 as I crawled out from under a table with rubbing my head.  "A guy can't
770 get any sleep around here without someone puts furniture over them.  
771 Hey, there's food here! Any smurfs? Ah, mead!" And I proceeded to drain
772 the barrel I'd just discovered. "Wassup? Did I miss anything while I was
773 asleep? Oh, nothing?  Good, I've not been left out."

846 rock you have encountered is the only one of its size- the majority
847 of the Inn is transendental.  Also, please becareful that you don't did
848 too far, least you hit the gravity berble7s walls.  If you did so, it would
849 be the equivenent of you trying to dig through a one-ton slab of steel.

863    As I have said in the past, Wonderer, yes, Backwater is a very special
864 place, especially when you wish to escape for a short time, to experience
865 something different, or to enjoy a good story (for free, no less!), or
866 to0learn something new about that debated subject you try to keep from
867 talking about.  Backwater, in its own simple way, provides the most in
868 thought from the least in complexity and "support" (by that I mean message
869 services, upload/download, qnd qll of the `other' fancy features you would
870 find on other boards).  Even when I don't feel like writing, backwater is
871 always there, a close friend nomatter what time of day.

879 Ah a feast! Food for thought I guess as well. The wonderer sat at the table
880 eating thoughtfully. Visions of past adventures flew through his mind. What
881 hat evub happened to man with the tub? Perhaps he had been sent somewere
882 out of touch with the inn or had lost it in the big move.
883  
884 The wonderer added his call to the many that had come before. "Service with
885 a smile" was the text of it. 
886  
887 Meaning and intent are often hard to connect he thought. "Pass me another
888 apple if you would" he said to the people at the other end of the table.

890 And so the adventure began.

953 Small stars danced around it, and a

955      The only person who noticed this   was a large guru in the southeastern
