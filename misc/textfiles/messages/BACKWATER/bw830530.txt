29 Hey. I like to put dowm other's computers, it make mine seem better.
30 However, where was that article on computer power versus cost? Byte, I
31 think..The old formula put power at a rapidly rising curve against cost,
32 i.e. if it cost more, it probable did even more, but now it seems an 
33 apple ][ could hold it's own against the big boys;; however, in small
34 machines you cna go from $82 bucks for a VIC20 to 4k for a full fruit and
35 still have the same computing power:a 6502, so if an apple is equal to
36 the biggies, the VIC is WAY ahead. It sure ain't purfect, all it has is 
37 a decent keyboard, good graphics, an excellent basic, and a price only
38 the Sinclair can touch. It even plays games! I would even reccommend it,
39 at least for a first computer, or perhaps a second, but to be honest,
40 never as an only.
41 By the way, I hear it makes an excellent print spooler, though you have to
42 load the program. Can any other spoolers match the price, or even come
43 close? (PS, you cna run games on it when you are't spooling, or even
44 cheat and compute.)

53      Grey Ghost, fade not!  Though this place teems with people, still
54 a quiet corner can be found.  Drink, draw strength from the dew gathered
55 fresh from the meadows of our land, sunlit and full of clean, refreshing
56 scents, of earth and grass, chamomile and the aroma of pines that sweep
57 in from the mountains.  Walk out and greet the sun, Grey; pluck a stalk of
58 sweet grass to nibble and speak to me of your wanderings...Appeal to our
59 people; open their eyes to see what this land could be...thus you will
60 awaken the joy inherit in yourself, even earning that name you sought!
61      It is an honour to make your acquaintance, Zalcor.  Whence comes
62 your name?  You evidently delight in dissent, to judge from the electrons
63 that spark from every conversation involving you!  How surprised was I to
64 hear, therefore, the respect you offered in your first words to me...
65      The brevity of my visit, Sir Humbug, is not because I do not WISH
66 to stay.  You are aware of the hours I keep, my shadow, in order to
67 respond to the challenging questions and display appreciation for the
68 healing salve you people give to me...sleep is traded off because I
69 desire no individual to be spurned, even though my time here is limited.
70      'By parental decree', eh?  Beautiful observation, for 'Dave' was
71 chosen entirely arbitrary from your own personality, in circumstances
72 quite beyond your control!  Therefore, it has little reflection on you.
73 But when YOU choose...Ah, you see my direction, my friend.  Never have I
74 failed to gain insight into the heart upon asking 'why this name?' nor
75 felt uncomfortable with using the choice--until you, Sir H.!

92 could be out getting radiation burns from all that sun? GO FOR IT

109 I think that the sky is that blue thing up there. Well, I guess
110 we could classify the sun as a U.F.O. It's hardly ever seen in
111 Oregon.
112 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
113 Uncomfortable, d?  It's true...Humbug just fit the moment, and it seems to
114 be a propos whenever I dial this board (witness the previous graffiti).
115 You, however, are the major exception.  Now, again you play White Rabbit,
116 with pocket watch and special appointment to keep, but maybe, if I am
117 patient, you'll share your eventual destination.  OR, should I have 
118 interpreted your "short stay" as describing each of your letters, as you
119 prop eyelids and wait for Morpheus?  In either case, you often refer
120 to mountain breezes...your favorite, I trust.  From happy times past or
121 recurring, or from dreams unfulfilled?  You make me recall natural times
122 on the Great Divide of New Mexico:  mountain sheep, sudden rain showers,
123 native trout seemingly as fat as long,  all the stars that ancients saw
124 before city lights and perpetual haze, coyotes gossiping about sniffing 
125 around these human intruders, and smells!   Maybe there'll be a time for
126 reunion of spirit and special place ere long.  A bientot.    Dave
127 One more thing...whence your own oriental moniker of not so long ago?  I'll
128 listen.  D.

130 d,  The name I have chosen to use in the Inn is but a faded badge of times
131 long past. The full name is Zalcor the Magnificent, but in my age, I have 
132 seen the foolhardiness of such@self-praise.  I usually go by but two names,
133 I gave my old one out of caution.  Many ears are turned towards us in our
134 conversation!  One name is held very dear to me, such that not even m
135 closest companions know what it is, the other name is Akonis, but it is ^Z
136 used rarely, for the day of that name is fading too, much to my sadness.^Z
137 I would wish for you to call me it, though. Alas, Zalcor is not fitting at^Z
138 all. It is a warrior's name. But I no longer battle.^Z

250 Hey you guys, heres an interesting poem for you:
251 FOR THE LADY OF A PHYSICIST
252 ===========================
253 By Michael Bishop, From Black Holes (compiled by Jerry Pournelle)
254 Introduction by Jerry Pournelle
255 I'm not sure I understand this poem.I'm not evenm sure why I liked it. I did,^Z
256 though, and I hope at least somebody else will.^Z
257   The introductory quotation is real, and in the final essay of this book, 
258 I'll have more to say. Meanwhile, a poem written by a Black Hole.
259     
260 "Although Bekenstein's hypothesis that Black Holes have a finite entropy
261 requires for its consistancy that black holes should radiate thermally, at
262 first it seems a complete miracle that the detailed quantum-mechanical 
263 calculations of particle creation should give rise to emmision with a thermal
264 spectrum. The explanation is that the emitted particles tunnel out of a black
265 hole from a region of which an external observer has no knowledge other than
266 its mass, angular momentum and electric charge. This means that all combinations
267 or configurations of emitted particles have the same energy, angular momentum
268 and electric charge are equally probable. Indeed, it is possible that the 
269 black hole could emit a television set or the works of Proust in 10 leather^Z
270 bound volumes..."
271 -S.W.Hawking, "The quantum Mechanics of Black Holes"
272 in Scientific American(January,1977),p.40
273   
274      
275   If I with her could only join
276 In rapturous dance,loin to loin,
277 Deep space itself would soon discern
278 Galactic rhythm in our burn.
279 Our bodies stars, our debts all void,
280 Then we would waltz and, thus employed
281 Inflate with megacosmic thrust
282 Through night and death and sifting dust.
283 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

286     Interesting, indeed.  But why should a black hole with such creative
287 potential bother with such insignificant accomplishments as these?  If my
288 understanding of this radical idea, worded almost too complex for me, is
289 correct, I think here is yet another mystery science cannot explain; why,
290 'black holes' spewing forth energy, not just gulping it into it's yawing
291 depths?!  Fascinating!...The poem has a definite masculine air about it,
292 and it surprises me that a dedicated physicist would fantasize this way...
293      You do wish me to call you Dave, do you not, my friend?  Your grip
294 on reality is tenacious--a good quality.  I've gleaned that you, too, are
295 a perfectionist, as well as an avid reader!  Fear not, I am not ignoring
296 your queries; every one I will answer, though not to your satisfaction,
297 of course:  such probing questions yield answers that simply provokes the
298 listener's curiousity further more; is that not so, my friend?
299      Akonis, Akonis--the sound of this name is appealing.  Yet if it is no
300 longer you, seek a name that IS.  Mourn not over the past, but learn from
301 it and change...Why, kind sir, are you an "ex-warrior"?  I hear regret
302 curling around your words; if it was a cause that you believed in that
303 you stood for, you would not have left it!  If it's effect was destructive,
304 there is no shame in peace.  Tell me, what kind of 'war' was it?
305      You wish for poetry?  I have one piece, that was conveyed to me line
306 by line during a whimsical conversation on a TSX-Plus operating system...
307 (This is possibly named A SHOPSHIRE LAD; I'm not sure)
308 From far, from ere & yon
309   twelve winded sky,
310 The stuff of life to knit me--
311   blew hither--here am I.
312 Now, for a breath I tarry,
313   nor yet disperse apart.
314 Take my hand & tell me,
315   what have you in your heart.
316 Quick, answer how can I help
317   you say,
318 Ere, to the winds Twelve Quarters,
319   I take my endless Way.    A.E. Housman

384 The Dragon lady is just another female -like the Val Gals (but

386 She would have you believe that she is wise and brave,
387 but in truth she ran at the first encounter of a stronger beast,
388 creaping back when she thought the coast was clear.

402      How dare you put on this pretense of knowing me, you slanderer?!
403 And what sort of challenge is this; claiming there was a confrontation
404 with "a stronger beast" and questioning my valor!  Of course I am "just
406 another female," nevertheless, I resent being classed with the supra-
407 conformist-type that would take on a "ValGal" identity for lack of one
408 of their own!  "Worthless," am I?  Back up your smears with proof!
409 I'd advise you, 'Max Grody,' to avoid slinging mud into the faces of
410 strangers, for it will be the death of you in the real world!
411      As for the response following it:  I do not seek out the billboards
412 in order to lure males to me like some haggard old maid--!  Let it be
413 known that I keep my whereabouts, including my phone number, hidden
414 because I deplore the attention of hungry males who appreciate physical
415 attraction but not a woman's intelligence.  Do you understand?
416 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>     d     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
417 Oh, d.  Please cool thy tongue.  Such anger is a distressing aspect in such
418 a wonderful entity. The drunkards in the neighboring stalls speak with
419 unknowing minds. Perhaps it is your anonymity which enchants me so. I find
420 it reassuring to find that some people take interest in others so readily.^Z
421 What I tell you now is the truest of words you shall hear me speak. I fought
422 a war against a very evil group of people.  It was a fight for the good in
423 people. I had removed only 5 from thier grasp. Akonis
424 DOES fit me, though not well. I find it and the memories it contains to ^Z
425 apealing to relinguish to time. I DO regret my "Ex-ness", but perhaps I shall
426 again rife my beautiful steed. Tell me, how did you get such a frightful nane?
427 I find you a kind individual, and would not classify you with such a formidible
428 beast, unless you speak of the Chinese dragon. It is an honorble being.
429    Oh, unknown writer above. You do not understand us? Perhaps you try too
430 hard.  Or perhaps the meaning of our words flees from those who need not 
431 understand. I gravely regret that others in this place dislike our conversation.
432 Perhaps they should not listen.

437      Akonis, forgive me my outburst of righteous anger; a temper is not
438 easy to live with, and I rue it's fiery existence within me...
439      My name is not meant to inspire fear; to me dragons are exciting and
440 challenging--but let me tell you the story from the beginning, Akonis,
441 and Sir David...Eons ago, I met Smaug.  He was the first I'd known; though
442 formidable, to be sure, Tolkien sculpted this creature's personality so as
443 to give him class along with his evilness.  "If only he hadn't been so
444 wicked!" I reproached Tolkien inside.  After Smaug, I kept a casual lookout
445 for more dragons, and discovered that they were not easily found; usually
446 they just whisper in & out of stories, leaving a stench behind--although
447 one gloomy fantasy series (by a woman author) yielded a fascinating sketch
448 wherein a man gained the mastery over the beast by refusing to meet his
449 eyes, and they cooperated on a journey.  But the turning point for me came
450 when Anne McCaffrey's noble Pern dragons found me.  Delighted and inspired
451 to find virtuous, wise and loyal dragons, I began to turn my hand to
452 creating dragons myself!  Not many artists endeavor to draw dragons,
453 for they have no model to sketch from, and they are DIFFICULT to do!
454 As time passed, my dragons took on gracefulness and believability, and
455 because I drew them everywhere, I became known by them.  Thus Dragon Lady!

458 Ahh.. another who enjoys the dragon kin. I as you am fasinated with these 
459 firey beasts and also as you was delighted and enthralled to discover the
460 dragons of Pern. My first encounter with the kind (not counting the sort
461 of the Chinese.) was Heinlein's star beast (a dragon of sorts). My feelings
462 towards Smaug are simular to yours. When I first got into microcomputers
463 I encountered a newspaper put out by Peoples Computer Company (which later
464 lead to Dr. Dobbs Journal and Creative Computing.) One of the things that
465 was a factor in my subscribing to the newspaper was the marvelous drawings
466 of dragons done throughout. I was later to find out that they were done by
467 a ten year old which considering the quality of the depictions left me yet
468 even more impressed. They presented the characteristic of being freindly and
469 kind. Ahh to have even a fire lizard for a friend. Alass I am left to my
470 dreams for thoughts of this sort, but mayhap one day... 
471 A thought! you expressed previously a desire to see words that have flowed
472 here in your absense. Perhaps we can strike a deal a dragon from you in
473 exchange for listings from me? I await your answer while deciding where it
474 would look best on my wall. (There are aproximately 1 million characters 
475 give or take a few thousand saved away on 8" CPM disks - 5 of them.)

477 P.S. I am amazed that you spend so much time and care in the formatting
478 of your messages that you leave on this lowly system.

482    Finally, people have paused in the ugly process of degrading other
483 people and have taken the time to talk about something worthwhile --
484 dragons!
485    They represent all I know, or want to know, in fantasy, and since
486 reading the Pern novels, in science fiction also.
487    I encourage you to keep your name, Dragon Lady, 'tis a noble cause
488 and a noble name.

513 Actually, d, I'm not well-read;  I was just very successful in trapping dabs of
514 this and that from classrooms past.  Sometimes they fit now.    Yes, the real
515 nature of our surroundings is important to me:  what's left of our conscious
516 lifespans will be ruled by what we have done and are doing for and to ourselves.
517 Soon, I may choose to offer the mix of my observations, imagination, philosophy
518 and introspection to those who will appreciate honest and tenacious leadership
519 in local government.    Since we have introduced ourselves more formally on tha
520 t other line, that you cling to your secret path distresses me.  I'm in the
521 white pages under "friendly", not "ogre", even when the night is most full.
522 'Nice to hear that dragons are a creation of yours, and not you of them.
523 What's a TSX-Plus ?   The verse rings so familiar of my new acquaintance...do
524 we both know Housman?  Or has that soul been so influential upon the lady?
525         Just plain Dave, more intrigued...

529      People of the Backwater Inn, I appreciate your gracious hospitality!
530 Unfortunately, I have no more than a week or so before I must go.  I will
531 leave one of my creations here, for you to remember me by, later...
532      Dave.  Housman's poem is no more than a striking coincidence!  By
533 chance, I discovered the scribbled scrap of paper and deemed it appropriate
534 for this honorable system; it so happened that it's source was electronic!
535 Speak further, my dear friend; do not be offended by my secretiveness,
536 please, and know that I understand you as the gentleman you are.
537    Hail, O Innkeeper!  I would be delighted to create one especially for
538 you, though my contribution seems but small in such an exchange.  So you
539 subscribed to that ancient journal P.C.C., eh?  A friend brought me his
540 yellowing stack because he knew I'd love the dragons therein, and I was
541 loath to return them, they were so absorbing!  Thank you for acknowledging
542 my perfectionism; it discourages anyone from pretending to be me.  How
543 dare you call this a "lowly system"--it is exactly what we make of it!
544 No matter that the hardware is small; I defend the value of small things,
545 for I myself am only 5'2" and weigh between 107-110--does that make me any
546 less of a person?  Of course not:  I become whatever I desire & work for!

571 Surprise! and consternation, but to the insubstantial one it
572 gives no surprise - but ponder ye on how an attack by a stranger

611 A joke.....
612 There was a Chineese man that couldn't see to well. So, he went
613 into the eye surgeouns office to get it checked out. After all
614 tests had been made, the doctor came back, with this news:
615 "Well, it looks like you have a cadarrack.", said the doctor.
616 "Oh, no, me no have cadarrack. Me have Lincoln Continental!"
617 replied the chineese man.
