27 much healthier subject. Maybe we can get some people to discuss the real
28 reason of Easter which is, Jesus Christ came to die for all of humanity

36       Nathan Critchfield unlocked the door to his fourth floor 
37   apartment for the two hundred and fifteenth time that year.  
38   His   small   hand   hit  the  lightswitch  on   his   left 
39    instinctively.   The  light revealed  a  large,  tastefully 
40  decorated living room with a kitchen and dining room off to 
41   the left and a stairway leading to the loft, as well as the  
42    bedroom, on the right. 
43       " Same as usual ", Nathan thought to himself.
44        He  switched on the stereo,  and then proceeded  to  go 
45    upstairs.   He  pulled the mail out from under his arm  and 
46  tossed it on the couch as he walked by.  He then opened the 
47   door to his bedroom.
48    .....................
49       The  door  at  the Inn opened and  a  short,  frail  man 
50    appeared and began to grope for something on the wall.
51        " Where's that damn lightswitch?  ",  Nathan asked, not 
52    expecting an answer.
53        " Sorry,  there are none over there.  " 
54        Nathan raised his head slowly,  and took a disbelieving 
55   look at the patrons in the room.   He stood motionless  for 
56   nearly  ten seconds,  and then like someone one had come in 
57    on the wrong party, turned around and walked out.
58    .....................
59        A  few  seconds later,  the door opened again  and  the 
60    frail man walked slowly in.    He had shortish, wispy brown 
61  brown  hair and a slightly oversized  nose,  but  otherwise 
62   normal  features.   On  his thin frame hung a  blue  oxford 
63   shirt,  a thin, navy knit tie and grey flannel slacks which 
64    were pleated and cuffed.   Over his sholder he was carrying 
65  a muted,  loden green herringbone tweed sportjacket, and he 
66   had a briefcase in his other hand.
67        Nathan walked carefully towards the bar,  and  motioned 
68   for the bartender.
69        "  Tell me ",  he asked sheepishly,  " what are all you 
70    people doing in my bedroom? ".
71        The  bartender didn't reply,  but just gave him an  odd 
72    look.
73        "  If this is a bar, can I have a ginger ale? "

84 Your absoulutly right.........
85 Anyone paying ateention to my 
86 wrighting should have the whole
87 concept of the ritual before doing
88 it..  Other words there is a small
89 chance of pissing someone or
90 somthing off...That is why if any
91 one has any questins or commints
92 ill be glad to reply..
93 I also suggest the no one under
94 the age of 13, even begin to study
95 this Book.. it has nouthing in itat 
96 this point that could effect a person other
97 then drawing a high Demon`s attention..
98 But the Book will expand !
99 into rituls which will actulay
100 manafest a demon & if the reader
101 pays close attention thy will now 
102 how to contain him... I suggest the age of 13 becouse any
103 younger an you are a prime target for
104 possesion.. Not saying that everone
105 on this planet isnt already
106 possesed, but thats beside the point..
107 Im talking about mass sickness here ! it all realy depends
108 whut the Demon wonts to do whith 
109 you,, he could push you infront
110 of a car or Train or whutever .
111 He could drown you or murdder you
112 or rape you or kill your family..ETC......
113 
114 So you see  TALELEPTA.
115 There is some concern, where
116 possesion is concerned I dont like
117 it whin it happens to me. & fill
118 no one should go through it if
119 thy dont Deserve it.........
120 I would also like to make a commint
121 about rituals must be perfection.
122 Well I agree, its true there be no mistakes made, BUT
123 not even  GOD  is perfect .....!!
124 & to that outher little commint,
125 "physical, occult & arcane actions
126 will be taken"
127 I really like a challanging aponit
128 in the relm of darkness.

163 HOW CLEVER!
164 I still suggest the keeper stop ripping other authors off and write something
165 original. It is digusting to see such rampant thievery go unquestioned and
166 unchecked. It is obviously the mind of a child, because only a child would
167 choose such a subject to pillage.

170   THE KEEPER OF SOULS is one of three things.
171        A) A fellow who is getting his kicks out of intentionally making
172           himself look like a social retard.
173   or more likely...
174        B) A twelve year old.
175        C) A unwashed, slightly retarded twelve year old.
176    I find it amazing that the atmosphere of BWMS does not promote more
177  intelligent conversation than what it often filling disk space.  One would
178  imagine that some young writers would rise to the abilities of others, than
179  create an excuse for otherwise calm, rational people to all act beneath 
180  their respective ages ( like I did above ).  Let us stop reprinting sections
181  of the Necrominion ( $2.95 in papaerback ) and get down to some intelligent 
182  banter.   Enough said.

188 Yes, I would say that the KEEPER of $2.95 paperbacks is a retarded twelve
189 year old.  Oh, excuse me.  A unwashed, retarded twelve year old (and I
190 would replace 'slightly' with something like 'totaly').

216      My, how things change around here!!!! When last I checked this was a 
217 nice, quiet, sedate, pseudo-Christian board at this number.  (At least no-
218 body talked about it...)  
219      Keeper:  Your stuff might be doing some good after all: I found it a 
220 terrific source of comic relief.  I haven't laughed so hard since someone 
221 tried to tell me that listening to rock music would send me straight to h-
222 e- double-toothpicks. May I offer a few modest suggestions from one app-
223 rentice student of arcana to another:
224      a) I have never felt confident about invoking ANYthing that I didn't
225 know a LOT about; one of them might show up unexpectedly for tea and soul-
226 cakes sometime, and that AIN'T a fun thought.
227      b) I have serious doubts about anyone spelling that badly (intentional
228 or not) having any of the traits necessary for keeping him out of trouble 
229 in these kind of things.  Think about it...
230      c) Publishing this type of stuff on an open public bulletin board is 
231 asking for backlash of epic proportions.  If this stuff is read and used by
232 impressionable kids who don't know what they're doing, and they get hit by
233 the consequences, and the Threefold Law is true and you started it... the
234 thought frankly scares me to silence.
235      I'm in no way an expert in this stuff, but I have done a lot of 
236 reading; and tho your rituals have enough in them to actually do something,
237 there are no protections in them at all.  I was laughing when I started 
238 this, but thinking of the implications sobered me up fast.
239      I'm sorry to take up so much space, but please just think B4 you type.

243   I wasn't aware that so many of the fine people on this board were 
244 involved in the occult sciences.  As it stands, I am an agnostic and
245 therefore pretty open minded.  I really don't believe in magick (correct
246 spelling?), but it is everyone's right to believe what they want - 
247 Christ, Satan or the Great Pumkin.   Let us just keep somewhat quiet
248 about it, because it does seem likely that some young impressionable
249 minds may may get mixed up in something which they are in no way e
250 equipped to handle.
251   I'm not against the beliefs, only the presentation of them on a 
252 public board.  And as for Frank, it does not seem likely that the two
253 are related - Frank was a better speller.
254    Oh dear, Letterman took the "p" out of my Pumpkin, and turned it into
255 typo in the form of an "e".  Whoops...

259         CHAPTER 12: Out Of The Closet
260 
261      And so it was that after the broom closet incident with my high school
262 home-ec teacher and an undetermined number of janitors, I spent several months
263 in hiding trying to get rid of those unsightly toilet plunger marks.  I had 
264 made many startling discoveries about myself with which I was having problems
265 coming to grips.  During what I like to call my "Age of Experimentation" I
266 tried my hand at a variety of jobs in an attempt to find myself.
267      I remember vividly the meeting with Johnson and Johnson's marketing 
268 executive during my six-month "Inventing Stage."
269      "Now what is it that you say you've invented Mr. Petrov?"  He was a short,
270 smelly man with a red stain on his tie and a curious green spot on his 
271 underwear.  His jaundiced skin reminded me of Vaseline and, upon close 
272 comparison, I could see that the hair on the back of his head was a brown which
273 closely resembled the color of his desk top.
274      Onto his desk I placed a small cardboard box with a hole in the top.  
275 Inside the box were tissues of the type that people usually use to wipe their
276 noses or clean quacamole off their underwear.  Pulling out the top tissue, the
277 next one stood straight up, ready to
278 be grabbed by the next snotty-nosed person to come along.  "You see, I've 
279 folded and stacked these tissues in such a way as to make the following tissue
280 stick up when the top one is taken!"
281      "Most impressive mr. Petrov!"  The man seemed genuinely impressed.
282      "Now, 'Kleenex' tissues are supposed to make you clean, and 'Softique'
283 tissues are supposed to be soft, but the most outstanding thing about my 
284 tissues are that they stand straight up-"
285      "So?"
286      "So I've decided to call them 'Erectile Tissues'!"
287      The man didn't seem too thrilled with the name I'd chosen for my product,
288 and after a few polite words, he sent me on my way.  A few months later I saw
289 my invention gracing the shelves of the finer drugstores and supermarkets in
290 my neighborhood.  Disillusioned with the harsh realities of capitalism, I 
291 sought out a simpler life.
292      The next few years saw me as a sheep rancher, a soviet labor leader, a
293 female wrestler, male wrestler, midget wrestler, and frequent guest star on
294 David Letterman's "Stupid Pet Tricks".
295      It was during these exciting years that I met the friend who would make
296 my life worth living.  I remember when our eyes first met and we were
297 overwhelmed with urgent ecstasy.  How his beautiful blond hair flowed in the
298 breeze as he ran towards me across the lush green meadow!  Oh, the agony of
299 feeling half submerged in quicksand while I struggled to run ever faster
300 towards the one who could make my fears vanish like so many defense contractors
301 at a competency hearing!  I remember how the piercing light of joy rended the
302 midnight vacuum that infested my heart as he whispered those immortal words,
303 "Baaaaaa."  What was once "me" had suddenly become "me and ewe".  Our happiness
304 was such that we could not erase the sheepish grins that gripped our faces.
305 What we didn't realize was that, since so many people are opposed to 
306 interspecies relationships, our showing of affection proved to be something of
307 a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Though we tried, we couldn't pull the wool over
308 anyone's eyes.  We began to feel like we were constantly on the lam.  The whole
309 problem was really starting to get my goat.  
310      His name was Loam, and boy could he french kiss!

332   The piper was somewhat bewildered by the actions that the bard's 
333 transporter had taken.  Crawling out of its definitly listing shape, he
334 looked about him.  The large circular room seemed to be a combination of
335 strange fungal growths mixed with circuitry.  A few sharp cracks of cooling
336 metal pulled his eyes back to the bards conveyance.  Wisps of smoke 
337 drifted into the air that seemed to hold the pungence of chlorine still
338 close behind it.
339   The white-suited alien stood with his middle limbs folded watching the
340 party examine their surroundings.  Walking over to him, the piper search
341 (oops, searched) his slate-blue face through the transparent breathing 
342 helmet he wore.  The slightly greenish gas he breathed did not obscure
343 the expression (or lack of it) on his slightly flattened, turtle-shaped
344 head.  Watching closely, the piper asked:
345   "Do you know where we are?"
346   "Of course," replied the alien.  "We are in my home."
347   The piper stood silent for a few moments.  "How, then," he continued,
348 "Is it that we breathe in here?  Has the atmosphere been replaced?  How
349 lucky for you, then, that you did not remove your breathing apparatus."
350   The piper looked about him for a short time, then turned back to the
351 alien.  "I'm afraid that this oxygen atmosphere may damage your home
352 severely.  The thing that tried to swallow me used oxygen as a digestive
353 aid -- broke down its food with the gas.  I'm worried that our atmosphere
354 might begin to digest the walls of your dwelling."

423 Almost as funny as the first time that was typed in - but not really.
424 /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
425 Random returns for a quick lurk, and feeling much like Jonny Pilgram,
426 becomes unstuck in time.  Two years later and the religious/spelling
427 fetish remains intack.
428 
429 I gave up the god myth (which includes the satan myth as well, of
430 course, but I en), but I enjoy a good speculative debate on the matter.
431 I like to think I'm not so arrogant to be a convinced atheist, but
432 agnosticism is such a pusilanemous cop out.
433 
434 About spelling, I have an affinity to the philosophy expressed by
435 Lenny Bruce:  the words have no force in themselves, it's the
436 receiver that gives them power.  A misspelled word is as potent as
437 the SAME word spelled correctly, it's the reader that diminishes the
438 impact, hence the reader must take responsiblity for her own bigotry.
439 
440 
441 One thing must be said, however, in the defense of proper grammer and
442 spelling:  It gives a common reference for sound debate, one must 
443 understand another's argument to enter into the fray.
444 
445 Eey Gads! i hate the editor on this system, i tend to drop words, and
446 my name is NOT webster.

448 The theology dispute in crazy. All gods are one, just as all goddesses are 
449 one. You sould not try to impose you beliefs upon others or denounce the 
450 beliefs of others. The world is in blance and will probably remain so. For 
451 every christian born there in a satinist born, and again a number equal to 
452 the sum of both in people who are neutral and care niether for god nor 
453 satin. I myself follow the path of the druids of old who believed in 
454 balance and the prefect harmony of nature. I am not trying to impose my 
455 beliefs on other. I am just trying to preserve the balance of things.

527 From the sea of unholy doctraine.
528 Watch as you shall be devoured
529 whith those seas of green
530 For in Hell lives the God of Pain
531 and on Earth lives the same.

543 and leave you far behind,
544 and as you will see Hell`s unkind...
545 For by now you have not seen
546 what has guieded me and what I mean.........SO...
547 Light a candle and weep a tear

560 (ch/lasy/lay) at the clouds or the stars, and keep going on with
561 life.  Living, learning, being, with dash of fun to spice things
562 up.  Not worrying.  A little bit of faith, a little bit of wonder--
563 everything will be okay in the end.  
564     Won't that be fun?  Laying back...

582 KEEPER OF SOULS (?): I find it hard to believe that anyone who's syntax and spelling is as bad as is yours, can do 
583 *anything* right. So much for your vacuous threats.If you want to play magick 'games', try "The Tree of Life", specifica
584 lly the banishing ritual of the pentagram. If you need a subject, may I suggest you use yourself?

587 Whut makes this cristan auther
588 such a powerfull nignog. First
589 I dont trust the Hebrew Qabalah all
590 that is centered around God, thats 
591 pretty dumb when the Holy Book 
592 tells you not venture in to the accults
593 But then theres Books that say its
594 ok to fool around whith the keepers of time
595 If you ask a priest whut it is like
596 to preform A Exorcisamin he would
597 most likely tell you its a blaphamy & it
598 one of the most unrighthess things you can do
599 thats becouse thy take the place of God
600 and call them selfs A direct desindet
601 But your not suppose to call your salf God.
602 he to selfish.  but eny way I wouldnt
603 even try to manafest eny thing in the name
604 of God, it just is powerfull moreless than safe.
605 
606 *******************************

610      Suddenly there sat Sten his his flight chair outside the Inn looking
611 =====Great, let's try that again...
612      Suddenly there sat Sten his his flight chair outside the Inn looking
613 just a little bit confused.  "Schulman!  SCHULMAN!" he screamed into his
614 radio, "You messed up BAD this time!  Looks like you transfered me onto
615 the surface of one of the surounding planets.  Knowing you, I'm on mars."
616      "Sorry, I tried to do it right this time.  I have the text book right
617 here, I was following the instructions.  There was one thing though, while
618 you were transfering over there was a small difficulty."  Schulman radioed
619 back.
620      "What, what MINOR difficulty?"  Sten sat there looking about at the 
621 few people who were coming and going from a nearby tavern.
622      "Well...there was some smoke and then some sparks.  I thought it might
623 be something else, other than you."  Schulman sat looking at a burnt section
624 of the control panel. "It looks kind of bad."
625      "WHAT?!?  Can you fix it?"
626      "I don't build these things, I just try and use them."
627      "Well TRY and fix it!  I don't want to be stuck down here forever!"
628 Pacing around an old tree.  "Better yet, when you get it fixed you can 
629 come down here too!"
