35 NOW FOR RADIO FREE SOUTH AMERICA
36 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
37  
38 ----    It was organized as a government office for the investigation of
39 crimes that trailed across the nation. The nation spread from ocean to ocean
40 at that point and was growing. National freeways were crossing the nation. The
41 cheap Ford automobiles had given crime an element of motion that trains or
42 horses rarely provided. Industry had arisen all over the world. So had
43 corporations. So had banks. Each one depended on great sums of capital.
44 Protecting this capital proved to be the weakest link in the industrial link.
45 Robbers and theives made off with enormous hauls. Loot funded developing
46 interests of organized crime in America. Thus was the Federal Bureau of
47 Investigation, FBI, founded.
48  
49         Now the aim was just a bit off the old mark.
50  
51 ----    Rodrigo rubbed his fingers together as if they were wet. It was too
52 hot for that. His saliva dried up in the seconds it took to rub them together.
53 No use in even trying. But he was bored. I was chewing on thin toothpicks so I
54 had no room to talk. Even the women in the streets were starting to frustrate
55 me with boredom. They would pass secure knowing I could not have them. I was
56 about to leave for home that afternoon when Rodrigo bumped my elbow.
57  
58         His car radio was up too far for me to ask what. The breifcase
59 attracted my attention when a glint struck my eye. It was honed metal. No
60 idiot would be wearing a suit today, but here was the idiot who would. He was
61 not the brightest agent in the country, but he did his job. Everyone knew he
62 worked for the Columbians. One thing about the Costa Ricans is that each of
63 them is keenly aware they have no army. So when Brazil moved tank columns up
64 and took the Canal, they wisened up fast. The man in town who spoke Portugese
65 was fast spotted as a plant. I was sent down here just to watch over him.
66  
67 ----    The Central Intelligence Agency had been crippled in a series of
68 scandals and deaths that would have been called a purge if it had taken place
69 in Europe or Asia. The New York Times had shown it's strength as the fourth
70 branch of government and sent the entire foreign service into resignation or
71 retirement. Weapons markets in Pakistan were the subject of an entire series.
72 The finances of former State Department drivers were audited. The contents of
73 many sealed diplomatic pouches were found to be the most secure means of
74 importing methadone and hash into the country. The New York Times won the
75 Pulitzer Prize four years in a row. Leaving the intelligence services of the
76 United States in a state of anarchistic competition to leave the least traces.
77  
78 ----    The idiot with the case walked up to a food stand and asked for a
79 beer. The big, dirty man behind the counter snapped open the can and gave it
80 to him. Idiot put it to his lips while his neck never moved. He wasn't
81 drinking. He must have been waiting then.
82  
83         "It is Mexican beer and he wastes it?"
84         "Let him stand there a while, he'll drink it."
85  
86         He was wearing tight shirt. His dark skin showed where the wrinkles
87 touched his chest. His face needed shaving. His outfit needed less gold
88 chains. I needed anything interesting to happen. Four months of waiting for an
89 agent to pass a secret is enough to rile any guy. And it was rapidly
90 approaching five months for me.
91  
92     	Kids in the Philipines play with these yo-yos. They aren't like the
93 Duncan Yo-Yos we had when the Iranians had hostages. They have weighted balls
94 and are used almost like bolos. Gauchos use them too, or so said National
95 Geographic a few year back. Maybe twenty years back, since it is so hard to
96 tell one aging yellow mag from another. In any case, the cords are the part
97 that you should watch out for. Thinner wires then you would think hold the
98 balls and use centrifugal force to cut through anything.
99  
100         I saw his nipples in his shirt. I saw his hair too. Guess I could even
101 smell the stench of his after shave. Whatever I was thinking in those last
102 minutes of my assignment was lost fast when the blood started to stain the
103 white shirt. He fell down fast and straggling kids ran down the street. I was
104 already out the side door when Rodrigo turned the car on and cruised around
105 the corner after them. His metal case was under him. He had fallen on it and
106 it probably saved the case for me.
107  
108 ----    The bureau took over operations on the continent of North America,
109 then South America also, as soon as the Brazillians took Panama. The Times was
110 too busy investigating shifty government to notice the new junta or the
111 military it was fostering for the eventual invasion of Canada. So it was up to
112 the bureau to move into the north of the wars, and stall the intelligence
113 outflow long enough for the press to allow the CIA a free hand in Rio. I was a
114 part of this delay contingent.
115  
116         We did a good job.
117  
118 ----    I pushed him off it while grabbing my wallet. I showed the man behind
119 the counter my badge. Americans are liked in the pecking order of Free
120 American States. We are wealthier than any others but are also older. We
121 actually do believe in democracy and the right of the vote. Besides, most of
122 the stories the Times satellites around the world are reports of ingenious
123 plots devised by the upper echelon of the CIA and DIA. Americans have
124 prestige. So did my badge. I was left alone.
125  
126         Opening the case wasn't easy. The tag was still tied to the handle
127 from when he bought it. He never figured out to take the tag off or set the
128 combination. In it were details of American port layouts in New Orleans. Cuban
129 naval markings were all over the papers. It amazed me to think of the military
130 damage that had just been averted.
131  
132         Then it occured to me to ask why this guy had to die. The papers would
133 have helped the Brazillians months later, and they might even have gotten
134 above Corpus Christi if they had taken New Orleans. I  would have gone to my
135 superiors about it but then I remembered the New York Times was just waiting
136 for a fifth Pulitzer Prize. I kept silent about it. Until now. None of us are
137 going to tell, are we?
138  
139 ----    The efforts of the bureau and the agency in Latin America averted the
140 greatest thrust of the Brazillian war machine. The first infringement of
141 Venezeulan air space had been in October and the last battle within the
142 borders of the United States was in the following August. Austin was the
143 turning point of the war. The Free American States had taken Rio in a naval
144 invasion during the next few weeks.
145  
146         It showed the capability of the shrewd American armed forces and
147 intelligence agencies, who then turned their attentions to the Warsaw Pact
148 with renewed vigor.

197 RADIO FREE NORTHERN EUROPE ASKS YOU FOR YOUR TIME
198    I was a flyboy. Our post was in the North Sea. Finnish shores were always
199 three minutes away. Knowing this kept us on edge, even asleep. We felt like
200 kids doing something wrong whenever we overflew the coastline and started
201 avoiding radar sweeps.

202     Movies would flash through my head. Lines on the displays would form
203 screens for scenes to be played out like in a movie house. Watching those
204 movies kept me relaxed while there were no real enemies. Moriarity was my
205 favorite. He would explain how he was going to scientifically kill Holmes by
206 tapping his veins when the speakers would cackle out warnings. Next I was
207 dodging fighters in the freezing cold of the European altitudes.

208     It was harsh once. Our flight suits were not designed for warmth. Mesh
209 nets were meant to keep us in. No white suited scientist ever gave any thought
210 to the piecing winds that tore through the craft at high speeds. They designed
211 those suits to keep us strapped in the nose of a dart flying faster than a
212 scream, not warm. 

213     I had gotten used to the cold after the first months of the war. Our old
214 station was New Orleans, Louisiana. Back home everyone heard about our cruise
215 to the North Sea before we did. A guy in my cabin got a newsclip from the New
216 York Times that said more about our station than the Admiral of the carrier
217 ever did and we had been out there for two years when the ship got hit the
218 last time.

219     The flyboys were over Oslo to tenderize the place for Norwegian infantry
220 when a submarine was spotted off the carrier. It was in the face down before
221 we got back within a thousand klicks. Our fuel lasted long enough to get to
222 the new airstrips on Franz Josef islands.

223     Two of us were hit over Oslo, and three of us never made it out to the
224 coast. In movies, planes get hit with a bullet that happens to hit the engine.
225 Then a trail of smoke curls across the sky as the plane starts to descend. It
226 glides long enough to hit the water after the pilot gets out. I wish. If a
227 dart even gets knocked four feet of course the computers crash and the reverse
228 wing design cannot be kept up. The plane shatters in the air for trying to fly
229 like an arrow. I still think the dart is the best machine for the purpose we
230 had. We hit eighty migs for every flyboy shot down.

231     Well, myself and Rodgers were the only ones who made it back from the
232 Forrestal. Even we had nothing to be debreifed of when we got out of the
233 hangars. We flew off the ship and left it in the ocean and then flew over it
234 belly-up on the way back to Franz Josef.

235     I can still see the way he was smoking and kept saying no. Rodgers was
236 cool. He had this way of saying things with an accent from either Alabama or
237 California but you could never figure out which. Whenever anyone asked him
238 where he was from, he'd just say a lie.

239     He had Akuri fighting Tomlins for two days once over a bet they made. Each
240 one thought Rodgers was from either Phoenix or Mobile. Akuri was a storage
241 techinician and he faked his way into repair the central terminal on the
242 bridge. The Navy didn't even know where he was born. Akuri told Tomlins he was
243 from Phoenix and Tomlins knew not to trust him as far as he could throw him in
244 flight suits. Rodgers was the only one of them alive now and he just seemed to
245 know it. 

246     Rodgers and I spent three hours in that room with a fat spic. We could
247 have been sleeping or eating but this idiot had the idea we where there for
248 every minute on the bridge. We had enough problems dealing with our loss of
249 station without figuring out how to get this spic off our backs. I kept saying
250 what the migs were doing on my back and told exactly how all the rest of the
251 flight died in the air but he never gave up. The spic thought I was in shock
252 but he never got better answers of Rodgers. We got out of there because the
253 spic wanted to go get more fat.

254     I was tired. Eating sounded miserable. So I just sat in the chair. It was
255 one of the ones we had in school with a desk put on the side and I had feet up
256 on this one too, only the theater of war had changed. The only other flyboy in
257 the room smashed a cigareete under his heel and left the room. He lit another
258 one in the doorway and said later. I told him to fuck off.

259     No one else in the flight was on my social calendar and he was going to
260 have to reschedule for when I wasn't busy getting wasted and sleeping.

261     It had a Red Star on it. It had a few labels on it but they were the
262 normal ones about misuse of army material. The Red Army had lost the Franz
263 Josef islands early in the war. They were the first things that had NATO
264 seized and the only thing they had managed to retain for the entire war. It
265 must have been left there before the seizure. Two year old war surplus from
266 before the war. This was going to be good.

267     I opened it and let the cartidge slip out. It was plain metal. Film
268 cartidges for my camera had felt like that. They were cheap wraps of tin with
269 points welded into place. Sturdy for a product of a nation under war from
270 every other nation on the planet. I tried to slip the cover down and look at
271 the disk. It refused to click down and I gave up. It would be better to go
272 have a look at what was on it with the`Agats we captured with the island.

273     I stood up with the decision to find the captured stores hangar. Every
274 island had one. They were usually the source and the end of the black markets
275 on every base. Soviet computers would never sell to Americans. I was about to
276 turn off the fluorescent tubes in the debreifing hangar when the loudspeakers
277 announced that the swing into Oslo had failed miserably. I shut off the lights
278 and left the last official function of the Forrestal flight behind.

279     Jason was blond. He had thin hair and it stood up whenever he took his cap
280 off. He also had the looks of a farm boy. He looked like an honest but awkward
281 kid from the Plains. So it was natural he sold heroin to footsloggers before
282 they landed on the beach. He sold me an Agat for three bucks and a gun for my
283 own preservation. Preservation was more expensive. I put the gun in my boot
284 and carried the Agat to the hangar my dart was in.

285     I took an extension power cord and plugged it in. It took a while to start
286 and I spent a large part of the time walking around the sides of my dart. It
287 had been pierced a few times. Cracks in the fiberglass were developing and
288 would have torn off chunks if Rodgers and I had flown for one of the other
289 islands. It was starting to scare me just as the Agat started real operation.

290     We all learned conversational Russian in the training school for officers.
291 It took another three weeks to learn elements of the written language and I
292 spent it. So the computer was alright, even if typing on it was hell. I put
293 the cartridge in the door and shut it in. I was expecting to find a load of
294 useless programs or a diary from a nurse. I had not predicted what was on it.
295 Not even close.

328 WHO CARES?
329 IRV CARES, AND DAMN YOU IF YOU SAY DIFFERENT.
330 EVENING ONCE AGAIN FROM RADIO FREE ASIATIC RIM
331  was August and the fleet was in port. My car was black and the vinyl was
332 burning the backs of my calves. Wearing shorts before driving in the Triumph
333 was a poor idea. The dark blue towel under my legs was not in the right place
334 and was hot anyway. I should have bought a new top for the machine that spring
335 but it had never seemed the right time. Until I was roasting, it had never
336 actually been the right time.
337 
    A Japanese sailor was crossing the street in a hurry. He had a reputation
338 to live up to and the Rose Festival was over in only three days. His uniform
339 looked dumb but at least it held to the tradition of the Rose Festival.
340 Portland is a Pacific Rim port. It had started having a fair in the Summers
341 years ago, and the military fleets of every Western Power in the Pacific were
342 invited into the port to help the citizens celebrate nothing in particular.
343 Americans, Canadians, Japanese, and a solitary Chinese destroyer were in port.
344 It was more of a liberty port for those two weeks than any other port in the
345 hemisphere. So, there went the nip off to prove how much liberty he could
346 secure in his stay.
347 
    Three local kids took off after him, they were in a truck with huge
348 wheels. Guess they wanted a chance to win the war again or something, but the
349 nip had few chances of evading their red neck fun. A contest between a soldier
350 and three punks would have been interesting to watch but I had somewhere to go
351 and three minutes to get there in.
352 
    I was late out to the National Guard base. The air police were jotting
353 down my name as the Phantoms came down for a landing on the tarmac a quarter
354 mile distant. I was pulling up to the field when he got out of the jet and
355 pulled off his helmet. He might not have noticed that I had not gotten there
356 until then, cause I got the idea the landing had not been easy for him. He was
357 on the base partly to get treatment at the Providence medical center for an
358 eye disfunction, and partly to serve as the squadron leader for the aircraft
359 that flew watch over the ships as they came down the river to put anchor in
360 Portland. He was just shy of getting his ace when his carrier was sunk
361 underneath him and since then his flying had gone to Hell. At least that was
362 how he set it out in the letter he sent.
363 
    I was putting on my sunglasses and trying to look cool when he got within
364 speaking distance of me. He had to go record his flight and see to his plane
365 so it was only going to be a quick visit. We would see one another later at a
366 pub on the waterfront, but I wanted to see him as he got into town. He reached
367 out his hand to shake mine, or so I though. But he was actually passing a
368 cartridge to me. It was black, and had Russian markings on it. He must have
369 brought this with him from the war in Europe. What the Hell did he bring it to
370 me for, I still wonder. Unless it had something to do with the latest Intel
371 processors, my chance of finding out anything about it was just about nil. We
372 said goodbye for then and I took the black box with me out to an apartment on
373 the East Bank.
374 

375 Everyone has a nemesis in their lives. Mine came from out at work. We had
376 entered the company at the same time, and then a race started to see who could
377 rise up quicker than the other. We didn't hate. We didn't even care about each
378 other much. But we knew that no matter what we did, the other would come out
379 smelling like a rose and smiling. It was cool. I had won the most recent match
380 by forming a consultant group of department heads from all over Intel, to
381 provide ideas for each head from all the others. It was doing wonders. This
382 scrutiny over a flight system for Boeing had given it a speed enhancement of
383 about the factor of three. He came out smelling like a rose for marketing it
384 at a price enhancement of around the factor of two, and he smiled.
385 
    Usual custom would be to have a beer and toast our race. This time, we had
386 the beer and steaks, over a wry conversation of the Russian cartridge. It was
387 a laser cart under a copy of an operating system that was obsolete four years
388 before the Russians managed to copy it. The programs for the thing had been in
389 the public domain for two. Aside from the program thing, the Russians had been
390 swift in making their copy, as such things go. The trouble would be in buying
391 a minicomputer with the right cart drive, and getting someone to do the mods
392 to it for us. We decided to go the corporate route.
393 
    Monday was when we did it. I suggested to each of the department heads
394 they compose a list of the machines around their departments. Intel has a
395 talent for designing a machine for an obscured purpose in the company and then
396 letting it collect dust for a decade before replacing it. Before noon, I had
397 the lists in my office, and by one, the right machine was waiting in the
398 repair center. Nemesis had the mods to the cartridge pack made by a company
399 technician to read just about accurately from the Russian cart. After we got
400 done with work we headed down to the repair center to see whether our scheme
401 had worked. No one else in the place was looking over our should and we went
402 to work.
403 
    Nemesis had taken Russian in high school. He carefully pronounced the
404 screen at every new blurb, and then translated it. Why he had to point to the
405 screen was of no pressing importance. Just that he did it annoyed me. It was
406 good to be there and everything, he was even witty, but I guess he had me at
407 an advantage and having his finger at the screen reminded me of it even when I
408 did not want to know.
409 
    We left that night nervous and just about unable to sleep. We had been
410 given a cart jam packed with schematics and designs for a new generation
411 Soviet aircraft, with no pilot to be strapped in, but a heuristic algorithm
412 for fighting at mach two. Imagining the havoc this could wreak in the war on
413 Europe was scary, imagining the havoc this could wreak on the Western powers
414 attacking the Russian was frightening, but the estimated production date of
415 three months ago was indescribable.

431 We should have notified the Department of Defense as soon as we figured it
432 out. And yet the cart was the property of a pilot just out of the war, and we
433 agreed to take it up with him at the pub the next morning. After not being
434 able to sleep, I figured I should pretend to wake up after dawn. I called the
435 office and after postponing a pending trip to New York for a press
436 announcement, I rang up the National Guard base. We decided to meet at a
437 restaurant near the financial district. He and I had gone through our
438 adolescence in Portland and we knew how to get just about everywhere in thirty
439 minutes or less.
440 
    Nemesis was in marketing. He had to go to New York without me. He had
441 taken the cart with him, and a note I found waiting for on the dominant
442 computer at work said he was going to ask a friend at the Strategic Studies
443 rtment at Amherst if the Soviets could produce a dart to those
444 specifications within the time limit they had described. It was a fine plan.
445 If he had not lost the cart in a mugging that night, we might still have it to
446 this day. As it was, we only had the copies on the machine at work.
447 
    He wore his pilot glasses into the place and sat down. He had been gone a
448 long time, it was good to see him. Ordinarily we might have shaken hands or
449 even embraced, but the cartridge had changed everything. He told me he had
450 found it tucked in a desk at an occupied Soviet military installation and that
451 it must have been there for three years or more. He also said he though an
452 agent had left it there in the evacuation hoping it would get to the right
453 staffers at the base. It had not. It was tucked to far away and no one had
454 found it.
455 
    We were talking over the capabilities of this new dart and whether NATO
456 forces could defeat them over time when in New York, two men with dingy rags
457 for outfits and perfect manicures stole the Russian cartridge under the neon
458 of a Japanese corporate marquis.
459 
    We had the plans and took them to the Department of Defense, but agents of
460 Japanese industrial espionage in the States also had these plans. I was not
461 sure what that meant to the world scene, but the Chinese were applying
462 pressure to the State Department about American joint intelligence ventures
463 with the Japanese in Chinese Hong Kong and it was plain that stopping these
464 plans from getting into nip hands was the thing to do.

509 Well, Friar, the way I read it, it goes something like this:
510       A Reed College kid stumbles onto a diary from the wife of a Nazi
511 diplomat, who convinced the Brazillians fifty years ago how cool it would
512 be to tussle with the U.S.  The war never quite clicked until some vague
513 point in modern times.  The New York Times had crippled U.S. intelligence
514 operations everywhere but the FBI was doing a fine job of killing Brazil's
515 spies and stalling the Brazillian wermacht.  New Orleans fell under naval
516 attack but the U.S. won and with the cooperation of the Organization of
517 American States, took Rio soon.  After the war, the U.S. was still feeling
518 mighty itchy and with NATO, launched a conventional assault on Eastern
519 Europe.  The war went on for two years when a pilot at a captured  Soviet
520 naval base found a Soviet disk of sorts.  It was analyzed by friends of
521 the pilot and found to hold design notes on a new Soviet fighter.  Japanese
522 spies lifted the plans in  New York and the U.S. decided to get them back
523 to prove to the Chinese how much they hated the Japanese.  So the hot
524 war in Eastern Europe is raging, and the cold war with Japan is going to
525 get a bit more frigid.  And the story isn't over yet.
526        Isn't it weird?

573    I always liked the sound that leather makes when it is worn. When a
574 friend had offered to let me wear his leather jacket for a few days, I said
575 yes and eagerly put it on. He said there was nothing in the pockets worth
576 anything, and I never even checked in them. That day I was bored enough that
577 it surprises me I had not even felt in them. Aside from the jacket there was
578 nothing else notable as far as dress. White leather sports shoes, white shirt,
579 charcoal suit pants worn every few days. About the only thing that strikes me
580 about what I looked like for that day, is the worried wrinkles of my forehead
581 and my clenched eyebrows.
582         It was at a night club that I met Kim, about a month previous. Our
583 eyes met across a crowded dance floor, like the romantic scenes of a thousand
584 poor movies from past decades. We danced together. I gave her the initiative
585 and she gave me a phone number. Since then we had met a few times, spending a
586 lot of time with one another at each chance. We went to distant schools.
587 Neither of us had time after school to even meet in one of the places in the
588 markets downtown. I had classes taken at night, she had children she was paid
589 to watch over. The best time we ever had was when we chased one another
590 through the aisles at an enormous book store. We kissed the first time in a
591 darkened nook that had been unaccounted for in the architects envisioning. It
592 was a perfect time. If I ever spent as nice a time with a girl, it has been
593 obscured in the dust rapidly raining down on my mind.
594         It was a sham, to tell the truth. My captaincy of the fencing team was
595 a clever ruse worked out by two confederates and myself. Our school was not in
596 the practice of giving students letterman jackets. We wanted some, and we
597 arranged with the staffers which swiss inserts we could get. I had planned to
598 be captain of the fencing team, a pitcher for the baseball team, and one of
599 the radio engineers. None of the roles was entirely false. It was the idea of
600 teams that we built up around the bare framework of a poor school without such
601 affairs. I fenced, played baseball, and did a radio show with a friend from
602 another school. Well, anyway, I had this plan to get a letterman sweater and
603 give it to her. Guess I read about it once in a short story, and I saw it on
604 television. I desperately wanted to give it to her though. It would be a real
605 proof of our adoration, and I use the word with sparing concern. We had no
606 idea where we fit into the arrangement of words used for teen love, or teen
607 lust, and you can understand. So my poorly deserved letterman sweater would be
608 a tether for me to her world, her school, her daily life.
609         She asked me if I wanted to go with her to the Queen of Hearts dance
610 at her school. I eagerly accepted and we made plans to meet, and then meet
611 eight of her friends for the night of the dance. Her closest friend had not
612 been able to ask the one she admire, so she was without a date the night. I
613 asked Kim if she was going to have trouble having a date around her friend.
614 She said no, and we talked about it.
615         The night of the dance came. I had the sweater and it was cleverly
616 tucked away in my bag, waiting for me to give it to her during the night. I
617 met her, and seven of her friends, and her date.
