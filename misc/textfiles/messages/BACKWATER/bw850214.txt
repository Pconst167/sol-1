26 Aw, go head... you owe it to yourself.
27 On to other matters, this was my first essay.
28 
29      It was one of those laid-back spring days down on campus.  Perfect riot weather...  The flowering plums
30 proudly displayed their bright pink blossoms.  The air had a gently scented smell.  Girls were working on
31 their summer tans.  The cold, rainy winter was just a memory.
32      The warm sun had pushed the awful realities of the War to the back of our minds.  Of course, the school's
33 weirdo's, the Students for a Democratic Society, were having another sit-in at the college administration
34 building.  Most of us didn't pay attention.  Spring was a time to enjoy nature's annual show.  I can't even
35 remember why they were there now... Was it Kent State, Jackson State, or the Cambodia Invasion?  No matter.
36 Sit-ins were a usual occurrance at the University of Oregon.  Most of us were political, but not political
37 enough to be concerned with another sit-in.
38      It was late afternoon when I returned to my apartment.  Janis Joplin was blasting on the stereo.  As I
39 was puttering around the apartment, the radio announcer broke in with a special report:  The police had 
40 invaded campus.  I looked at my roommate, "This one is going to be too good to miss."  We high-tailed it
41 back down to campus.
42      By the Student Union, 30 or 40 of my classmates were milling around aimlessly.  A few quick questions 
43 revealed that the police were inside the Administration Building arresting the demonstrators.  No one had
44 any idea what would happen next.
45      Our view of Johnson Hall, the administration building was blocked by trees.  Shortly from that direction,
46 we heard a continuous angry whine.  The whine of a tear gas generator ready for action.  The 'parade' had
47 started.  Men in formation marched into view, the sun gleaming on their helmets.  In the lead was the tear
48 gas generator.  To one side an officer with a shot gun.  The rest carried long riot sticks at the ready.
49 Following was a jail bus.  Wire mesh covered its blacked out windows.  We knew our classmates were inside.
50      The sight was intimidating.  But not intimidating enough.  A single longhaired woman lay down on the 
51 asphalt and blocked their path.  A policeman dragged her from the roadway by her hair.  An outraged groan
52 went up from the crowd of students.
53      Academic freedom was being trampled by the establishment.  As the police officers turned onto University
54 Street and passed us by, catcalls rang out:  "Pigs Off Campus!"  "Off The Pigs!"  Events began to escalate.
55 At first paper cups full of soft drinks flew towards the marching men.  Then from behind me a ceramic coffee
56 cup was hurled.  It moved in a lazy arc and struck one of the policemen in the neck.  He went down.  A cheer
57 resounded.  The other officers helped him to his feet.  Their arrogance was broken.  They shifted their sticks
58 and glanced from side to side nervously.
59      We followed the police up the street, shouting our anger.  The jail bus passed by the officers and 
60 rumbled out of sight.  Finally, as if they couldn't stand it any more; the police turned.  The tear gas 
61 generator began to spew its noxious fumes.  Students began running in every direction, eyes watering, noses
62 burning, the aroma of the spring blossoms lost to the gas.  In a moment it was over.  The police were gone.
63 The campus once again belonged to the students.  This was the first skirmish in a battle that would last years
64      Today, I'm on the other side.  I'm a cop.  Those days still live with me, but under the surface.
65 
66      Er... this is what's known as an author's intrusion.  My essay rambles for another few hundred words 
67 trying to make a point.  What it boils down to is that today when I look at a punked-out child of the street
68 and my blood pressure starts to rise, I pause and remember... remember how I felt and thought back then.  I
69 had a deep sense of right and wrong.  I still do.  Only my persepective has changed.  My perspective doesn't
70 make me better than anyone else.
71

75 Grand D,
76      What can I say?  It was worth a shot.  Sometimes my business takes me
77 to CSD (rarely anymore).  I'll try to look you up if I'm ever in the neighborhood.

82 Mohammed:
83     And what business is that? I remember you once saying that
84 you were a cop, but I find that hard to believe. My dad was a 
85 cop and you no more seem the type than Dr Frankenstupe does.
86     I'm working at Columbia County Children's Services. If 
87 you're in the neighborhood drop by...in uniform of course. It
88 makes it look like we're working that way. Frank Jones says

99 Becky T.: Hello!
100 L'homme : What's this?  Accusing *ME* of pirating?  Now, really, that's too
101 much.  Would *I* do a thing like that?  Pirating, indeed.
102 +++++++++++++
103 What's this I see on drive b?  Confessions?  Identity bleed-over?
104 I can see where honesty could promote better entries, but REAL NAMES is a bit
105 much.  I'll have to agree with Piper.  However, identities is a different story
106 altogether.  Here is a list, if anyone's interested, of the personalities I've
107 used since I started here on BW:
108 Milchar(this one), Dimat, Novar, (last two seen in the Ruby Vally adventure)
109 Sundownor (McKane/NET story), UNDERGROUND HQ (]]]]]]]] border), J.K. O'Hara,
110 Harry Foster, Farley (current NET story), and Master Changer (misc. fantasy
111 entries, also has a terrible memory for names).  It seemed incredible to me
112 when I first read BW that one person would write the entries for two different
113 personalities; now, I see each one as a different facet of my being.  One of
114 my primary interests before I arrived was Advanced Dungeons and Dragons- thus
115 my love for fantasy.  The nasties I play (Sundownor, John K., etc.) are a way
116 to be "rude, corrupt, and cruel" and not hurt anyone.  They're foils, really,
117 for anyone who wants to cut them up.  Of course, the fun's gone if I let them
118 get killed off withouut a fight.
119 Farley- well, he's an experiment.  After re-examining my entries and by 
120 listening carefully to critics (thanks, L'homme), I decided to begin anew.
121 He seems to be working.  I can, and have, "pour out my heart" with his voice.
122 Feurary always seemed to me to be the best time of the year for sharing.
123 That's why I enter this.  AlthoughI know that none of my personalities can
124 be fully severed from this one from now on, I don't really mind.
125 +++++++++++++++++++
126 The Travelling Book before me, I began concentrating on the letters.  Slowly,
127 the numerous symbols rose from the pages, hopping to and fro in a semblance of
128 "The Dance of Chaos".  I began to Place-form: that is, position the letters on
129 the page, under certain rules, to spell out the place I wanted to go.
130 "Let's see...S followed by either F,I,N, or another S...  Aha!  N!  'Apply the
131 letter "N" mentally then follow it by a T, W, or I unless you plan to follow 
132 next letter by A, E, or R- in which case you must apply those letters first,
133 then the N, then the T, W, or I.'"
134 The dance of the symbols grew more intense as A's and N's fluttered to the page
135 in increasing numbers, darkening the air before the tome.  With 200 or so rules
136 to follow, plus exceptions, Place-forming isn't the speediest mental exercise
137 in the universe.
138 The cloud of letters tithinned.  The last few letters scampered to their places,
139 with the remainder falling back into the rest of the book.  Finally, alone on a
140 page were the words "Backwater Inn".
141 I held my breath.  For a moment, nothing happened.  Then the letters shone.
142 A glow almost tangible enveloped the tome and I, smothering what I could see
143 of the outside world.  A few more infinite heartbeats later, the glow faded.
144 I stood alone, just outside the door of the Inn.  A warm glow from within told
145 me that the Innkeeper was no slouch at
146 his job, and that there were patons there who, even now, talked and joked
147 among themselves.  I closed the tome and walked in quietly so as not to
148 disturb conversation.  I wondered, for a brief moment, exactly what I would do
149 if the Inn closed its doors.Go elsewhere?  Where?  I pushed the ugly thought 
150 back into the depths of my mind.  Quietly, I found a comfortable chair near a 
151 corner, sat down, and observed the new faces tell their stories.

155 Unmasked : Sondargaard, your recent entries to me are quite powerful. You have managed to put into words feelings and
156 emotions that are sometimes quite difficult to write about. I applaud your courage for entering them here, for all of
157 us to read. Don't use the word corny so much. Love is a difficult subject to write about without sounding 'corny.' Don't
158 worry about labels and catagories; they shouldn't be applied here. While I am not a big fan of the so-called love
159 stories seen here of late, your messages, at least to me, don't fall into that style. Messages about love, lost or not, and
160 how it affects your life, are messages everyone can relate too. Thank you...
161 Piper : Out To Lunch...I'll try again Thursday.
162 Alc/Mes/Mel/Barfoot : I promised I wouldn't tell! You gave away the secret sooner than I expected. Are we ever going to
163 find out what happened to Raza and the island? Are we going to here from your participant in this reality at the school
164 district soon? No luck on Dr. Halo yet, still trying...

169 MacBeth: In Defense of MacBeth - Summation
170 
171         Ladies and gentlemen of the jury: I am a mere public defendant,
172 assigned to defend a person who is down and out in the worst way. I can't
173 afford to put on the floor show my illustrious opponent has done for you
174 these past few weeks. I am not able to conjure up ghosts of victims
175 fallen by unfortunate coincidence unproven under cross examination to
176 have anything to do with my client. I must base my case on pure unadulterated
177 fact, not tricks with mirrors. And you, my companions on this incredible
178 trip through the halls of power in our country, must decide, given only
179 what you have seen and heard in this court room, the guilt or innocence
180 of my client, MacBeth.
181 
182         For him to even be here to be tried under the objective eye of
183 the judicial system, is an unbelievable feat of perseverances and fortitude.
184 So close to death MacBeth was, that only a miraculous escape (so I changed
185 it a bit...) from Dunsinane spared his life. The vicious attacks perpetrated
186 by the prosecutor's so called witnesses could not end the story one chapter
187 short. MacBeth chose on his own to finish the story, and come out of hiding,
188 and come what may, put his life in the hands of justice. A far better deal he
189 gets here in this courtroom than at the hands of bloodthirsty enemies.
190 
191         What can you say about a man who's life as crumbled about him? Oh
192 the prosecuting attorny levels all of the blame at MacBeth himself, and
193 none at MacBeth's environment. He ignores the three fortune tellers, from part
194 I.i of the testimony. Do you believe in ability of some special individuals
195 to tell the future, or at least glimpse at it? Are you willing to deny the
196 monumental amount of evidence that supports the claims of these so-called
197 witches, a term bandied about by those who don't understand, or don't want
198 to understand? Could you deny your own future, when presented to you as it
199 was to MacBeth, in part I.iii of the testimony? What a weight, what a burden
200 to bare! To deny the future is to deny the past. It can't be done. But Mr.
201 prosecutor would have you believe otherwise. He would have you condemn this
202 man for something he had no control over. Is that fair? I ask you, is that
203 fair!?
204 
205         Lady MacBeth. Crumbling, falling, slipping into a chaotic personna
206 of murder and death. Poor MacBeth. What was he to do? What would any of you
207 do, when presented with such a dilemma? Your loved one demands an action of
208 you. An action that goes against every grain of your existence. You are loyal
209 to the king, yet your mate seeks more. More power, not so much for yourself,
210 but for his or her self. To deny this request is to deny your love, at least
211 in the eyes of the other. To succumb would be treachery, but what a choice to
212 make! You have spent your whole lives together. Suddenly to cut that off; a
213 fate worse than death; and infinitely better than the fate that may become
214 you when your act is discovered. An impossible decision to make? Nay, a
215 decision must be made. Are you willing to condemn a man, MacBeth, because he
216 made a decision? He took action. He struck a path, and kept at it. He
217 decided his wife was more important to him than anything else. Oh at first 
218 he denied it, as in testimony I.vii and II.ii, but he could not deny his
219 wife's will for long. Treachery they call it. I call it love. Are any of you
220 willing to admit you would do any different? Are you willing to go home and
221 tell your wives and your husbands that you love your king more than they?
222 Are you willing to tell them that you would rather see them die than someone
223 else? Are you willing to admit that you, in MacBeth's place, would have done
224 they same thing? Will you be honest, as MacBeth was???
225 
226         The events that follow are incidental. Poor MacBeth was sucked into
227 a whirlpool of distrust and hatred that he did not create, but instead
228 inherited. To protect his wife, his own protection was secondary, he had to
229 take measures that when examined out of context, like the prosecutor has
230 done, do take on an ominous look. But he was forced into the situation. Once
231 MacBeth decided to do what he did, there was no going back. Unfortunate
232 incidents took place, and I will not remind you of what the lawyer to my
233 right has so masterfully shown. The decision was made, but the ramifications
234 didn't stop with the act. Lady MacBeth, then a wasted shell of her former
235 self, and prophesy foretold the actions of MacBeth. He was like a puppet on
236 a string. No real will of his own, only a knowledge of the terrible things
237 that must be done, in order to continue. I assure you he regrets all that
238 was done, but no other path opened itself up. A one way ticket to Hell was
239 purchased by MacBeth. Will you pay for the return fare?
240 
241         I ask you...no I beseech you, fine people of the jury, to find my
242 client innocent of malicious forethought and action. While there is no
243 doubt, no fogginess about what has happened, a tragedy that it is, there
244 is a question of why? You can't pass judgement without asking why. Please
245 don't be caught up in the yarn of power hungry madness the prosecution
246 has spun. See above it and around it...and through it. That theory is full
247 of holes. See MacBeth for what he truly is, and man who was at the wrong
248 place at the wrong time. An unfortunate situation indeed. Find MacBeth
249 not guilty. Don't make a mistake, and leave this person stranded, never to
250 return to the country he loves; the country he has proven his love for many
251 times over as a hero in the military. Don't leave this true patriot in the
252 cold. Don't make the mistake of making this case a total tragedy. Don't make
253 this the tragedy of MacBeth. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.

258 	A candy factory has 10 gumball machines. Each machine
259 produces 1 oz. round gumballs. Each machine produces gumballs
260 of the same color: 10 colors in all. One day, it is discovered
261 that one of the machines is producing gumballs that only weigh
262 1/2 oz. You are assigned to the case. You must find the
263 defective gumball machine. The problem: You are only allowed to
264 use a weight scale once. No multiple weighings, no putting all
265 10 samples on the scale at once, and removing them one at at
266 (a) time. You are allowed only ONE use of the scale. How can
267 you determine which machine is producing the bad gumball? Now
268 remember, once you determine which gumball is light, you can
269 fix the machine based on the color of the gumball you think is
270 bad. But you can only weigh the gumballs once. It can be done,
271 but how? To reiterate (typed in on the fly) Each machine
272 produces gumballs of the same color, but each machine's gumballs
273 are different in color from any of the other machines. Machine
274 one produces red gumballs, #2 blue, #3 green, and so on...

294   The brief gust of wind brought the soft smell of the rain-wet air into
295 the rather smoky air of the in.  Along with the cool damp, a figure dim against
296 the poorly-lit outer wall slipped into a seat at an empty table.  Passing by
297 the innkeeper who was deftly drawing another flagon of ale, the piper lifted
298 a filled mug and placed it on the newcomer's table.  As he set the mug down,
299 he glanced at a familiar face.
300   "Well, hello Milchar.  Glad to see you back," he said.
301 pppppppppppppppppppppp
302 L'Homme -- if you are trying to call me around lunch time, you are gauranteed
303 NOT to make connections with me.  Being rather old and fat, I have been 
304 attempting to improve my physical condition for the last year and a half.
305 I spend the time my stomach feels would best be spent in eating lunch thrashing
306 madly about in a large container of chlorinated water.  I attempt to put in
307 30 minutes lap swimming when other more sane persons stuff their faces.
308 (the result of a year and a half?  When I started this regimen, I weighed
309 234 pounds.  I still weigh 234 pounds, but my waist is four inches smaller
310 and my shirts are all too tight.)
311 If you want to call, you have an even chance before 9:30 AM and after 1:30
312 PM.  (That's why when there's a lot of work to be done I work nights -- I 
313 rarely get enough time in one chunk during the day.  It's always meetings,
314 problems, answering questions, expiditing matters of one sort or another.
315 My most productive time is the time before 9:00AM or after 7:00 PM. Sigh.

319 "Fair is foul and foul is fair." And then Mcbeth walks on later and says "So 
320 fair and foul a day, I have not seen." Well, I'll play Carton and whether or 
321 not I believe this is irrelavent (yes, I know it's very misspelled). 
322     Don't you see? That is absolutely proof that those evil witches had control
323 of him. He was possessed. He couldn't think rationally. His very own wife said
324 he was too full of the milk of human kindness. He was a good man, very very 
325 good. And, because he was so good the instruments of darkness saw that fit to
326 change. And, then his wife was sticking her face in his, calling him a coward.
327 He had all these things against him. And, Lady Macbeth said "let me pour my
328 spirits into thine ear..." (not a direct quote, can't remember) and then she
329 made that prayer. Why she poured all her vileness into him. He had both the
330 witches and his beloved wife against him! Two evil forces, working for the
331 common enemy of man... (Now if you want me to say the Lady wasn't evil, that's
332 a different story. Oh, about Carton, that wasn't an insult. Drop the comment,
333 because, I realize now, there is no other way to read it). -Tanya

350 	Tanya : I am sorry, but I don't get the Carton reference. Your use of
351 Fair and Foul is but one of many Equivical statements found in MacBeth. Check
352 scenes I.i.4, I.ii.last, I.iii.65-66, I.vi, II.iii.28-36, IV.ii, IV.iv.138,
353 V.iv.10, etc... Also, think about the crucial disorder. There comes a point
354 in the play when you now things can not resolve happily for all. But as in
355 all tragedies, the Tragedy of MacBeth shares a few common bonds. The overall
356 situation is better at the end of the play then at the beginning, although
357 this is sometimes subtle. Bad for individuals yes, but good for society. And
358 of course, the person in the title always dies... The only exceptions I can
359 think of that don't fall in to Shakespeare's rigid styles are Trollis and
360 Cressida, ...Pericles, A Winter's Tale, and Cymbaline.
361 	One last point about my previous entry. Remember, the job of a public
362 defender is to get his or her client off. I purposly left out many a terrible
363 thing MacBeth did, in order to sway the judgement of the jury. Not fair you
364 might say; remember the prosecution will do everything in their power to do
365 the exact opposite of me, so there is no doubt that both sides will be heard.
366 Our judicial system, in its purest form, is a thing of beauty. It is only
367 the abuse by individuals that tarnish the system; an all too often occurance,
368 unfortunately.
369 	One last point. An Oxford definition of 'weird', as in weird sisters,
370 is 'fate.' That is a point I based a great deal of my case on. I don't think
371 we were so far apart in our opinions after all...

378      Fog covers the ground and wreaths the frame of the heavy oaken door
379 that stands as guard against the ravages of winter, and the door shows 
380 cracks where time has left its mark.  As I stand upon the planks at the
381 entrance, my hand traces a pattern along one of the larger furrows,
382 following and caressing the impression of character.  The age  may show, the
383 signs where it was modified from another use obvious, but it serves its
384 purpose so well.  And the memories that it can evoke!  Yes, it is a
385 marvelous door, so much history.........  and it nearly hits me in the face
386 as it swings swiftly outward from the force of a cluster of hands. 
387 Stumbling backward in an effort to avoid the contact, my boot catches on the
388 edge of a board and I fall from the low porch into a cluster of bushes
389 that huddle against the near wall.  From this highly dignified position I
390 can hear the laughter and a few bits of banter drifting back to me through
391 the cold evening air:  "TWIT!....... Did you see...... drivel!..... modified
392 BIOS?....." as the voices fade into the distance.

393      After returning myself to some semblance of respectability, I once
394 again mount the steps.  The door being already open, I enter and pull it
395 shut behind me, then turn and face the room.  Though different it is still
396 the same, like comparing this spring's rosebud to last.  Patrons jostle and
397 curse, laugh, argue, and the good Innkeeper keeps an eye on the proceedings
398 while quietly maintaining his own council.  The room is slightly smokey,
399 the air fragrant with the odors of wood from the hearth, roasting meat,
400 pipe tobacco, and a thousand other smells familiar and not.  I feel just
401 a bit intoxicated by the climate that surrounds me, and a warm glow fills me
402 as I slip quietly through the crowd toward the table I had used most often
403 in the past, tucked unobtrusively into its own small corner near the back
404 of the room.

405      Looking about me from the comparative safety of this table, I see that
406 the Inn does indeed have some familiar faces:  there is the Piper, his face
407 slightly pink from exercise and from the entertainment his pipes provide;
408 though I don't see him, the Bard's presence is felt somehow, as if he were
409 prepared to jump out from behind a curtain to regale us with some bawdy
410 song;  Dr. Frankenstupe has just finished telling a story about the days
411 of his youth in the Town Of Two Buttes.  But where might the apprentice
412 be?  I still owe him a cup of tea from a favor once rendered.  Perhaps he
413 will soon be revealed; I see a group of patrons standing there, removing
414 mask after mask, and under each is a familiar visage.  I'm surprised at
415 their sudden need to bare their soles since we did not need to know who
416 they were in other realities, but I am also surprised to see some of the
417 faces that appear from beneath the masks.  I fear that I cannot join into
418 their game though.  A smile curls the corners of my lips as I think of the
419 words of a character from still another reality that would fit my position
420 well:  "I yam what I yam, and that's allz that I yam!"

421      I peek behind the curtain that covers a nearby wall, then I let it fall
422 into place again.  What will the Innkeeper think?  That was certainly a poor
423 gift to give on a day dedicated to affairs of the heart.  But then again,
424 perhaps it was not.  I guess that only he can answer that question.

426 
     Ok, I admit it, I HAVE entered under other names in the past.  I put
427 some poetry here under the name of Jedeves (a bit personal, those, but since
428 we're dropping masks...), as well as a number of other names during the
429 dabate phase a little over a year ago (trying to stir things up and get
430 everyone talking).  A couple of times I've used male names (though not for
431 anything major) just to see if I would still get those brownie points that
432 gender seems to bring (I didn't).  Sigh... Back to the Shadows again.....

435 There were several and varied reasons for the use of the multiple persona forms
436 here on the backwater. One of the main ones was to see if I could write using a
437 believable female voice. In the course of doing so I got caught up in the Magen
438 story myself. It is my intention to finish the story as time permits, meanwhile
439 rest assured that Raza and Magen are enjoying themselves immensely.
440 
441 voyeur ---- You are 100% correct.  Testing of the hypothesis concerning the way
442   personality types are treated was very revealing but hardly surprising. Again
443   it served to point out that social and cultural bias still runs strong.
444 
445 Tanya ---- I have enjoyed our interchanges very much. I sincerely hope you will
446   continue to communicate with me as an integrated personality.  Thank you very
447   much for your stand against the forces of destruction. I feel certain you are
448   a person who embraces many of the values that make us caring human beings.

458 do so. Macbeth was not GOOD, he hide behind it so he could say 'See, I don't really want to do this, the witches made me. Pity
459 me, and destroy the witches.'
460   When Lady Macbeth said Macbeth was to full of goodness, she
461 was trying to live out her self-stlyed evilness. She knew that evil sees good as weak, and she knew Macbeth was weak, so she 
462 made the assumtion that too many people have made. If you are weak when you do something evil, you are not REALLY evil, in fact
463 you are good. 
464   "IT is very easy to aviod the issue, and assume that since he was controlled he commited no crime. But isn't the fact that he
465 could be brought out of his orignal fate proof that he was in a murderer who was lucky enough to have some witches as scapgoats
466 around. I belive that he had much more freedom than he wallowed himself to be given credit for.
467   "Every murderer has a story to prove he was only following fate or other inaviodable motivation, as does every rapist, thief,
468 and embellzeler. That they had a motive does not make them innocent."

473   "No! Don't do it! Don't give up you privacy!" I said.

475    "I only dropped my known mask for the moment it took me to tell my side,
476 (forever it seemed...) I didn't mean for the rest of you to give up that
477 part of yourselves that allowed you to say something without personal attack.
478 I may have shown you my true self, but you STILL don't know who I am..."
479    As I said these words, I was taking a few slow steps towards the door but,
480 the path is blocked. I will still remain... er- we will still remain...

485     Melissa-- Sorry to keep refering to you this way but I have no idea what to
486 call you now; please give me something. Why, yes, of course I wish to keep 
487 conversing with you! Why wouldn't I?
488     Defense-- My entry was written in the early morning, about 5 minutes after 
489 I awoke. (See where my priorities are?) I realize that the fair/foul image was
490 used through-out the entire play. (I don't think I expressed myself very well
491 due to the fact that my eyes were falling out of my head). I assumed that the
492 jury knew of Macbeth's crimes. Giving in explanation for them, I was. Those 
493 evil, midnight hags possessed him. When he repeated their earlier statement,
494 in but a only slightly altered form, this was clue to their influence over him.
495 The fact that those comparisons were used through-out the entire play (and 
496 perhaps this was just a coincidence) you needn't tell the jury... My reference
497 to Sydney Carton was from A Tale of Two Cities. Carton helps this lawyer with
498 cases. Implying that I am Carton and you are Stryver (the lawyer he asissts) is
499 in insult. I didn't realize this at the time. Certainly, I do not wish to give
500 you in insult, especially when it was not deserved.
501     Lady S-- Macbeth, himself never claimed that it was the witches fault.
502 Although towards the end he realized that the witches and his wife had some 
503 influence over him. Through-out the majority of the play he thought it was only
504 himself. He said "I have no spurs to prick the sides of my intent, only vault-
505 ing ambition" sorry I don't remember the scene, it was shortly after the Lady's
506 big scene. He never considered that who could be controlled. Which, in my 
507 belief, he was not. But, I do think he was influenced by the witches and his
508 wife. He was free, and made the choices. That's what made him a tragedy. And,
509 he realized this all at the end. Well, I am rambling. One thing: this is my
510 opinion. I'm not saying it's right, sorry if it sounds like it's the One Truth.
511 If it does, that wasn't intended. For all those who are bored by Macbeth, sorry
512 I'll try not to ramble next time. -Tanya

516     Discarding my now-useless overcoat, I trample on. The biting, snowy
517 winds almost beakon me to return, yet, my unconscious being tells me to
518 tarry forward. I trip over a branch; my face forced into the damp, white
519 powder. My frostbitten cheeks, now covered with ice, feel the need for
520 the nourishment that I have been denied. Crossing a hillock, I see....

553 I listened intently to the conversation about me.  Nearby, a mug was set down
554 on a table.  I turned to see Piper smiling, holding a mug of his own.  He'd
555 thoughtfully brought me a draught of the Inn's excellent ale.

561 With a groan of effort, L'homme and I managed to lift the lid on the coffin-like boxes.
562 Wires, PC boards, and smaller boxes returned the stare we gave them.  Only a piece of paper broke the technological

564 L'homme snatched the paper, irritated that the boxes had not produced Minksy and Flemming.
565 "Inventory, shipment 3C.  AI sub-unit 24-ZE, FD-78 series.  Deliver to new adress,  S.E. 54th Street, Portland."
566 "FD-78?  That's Fred's model number!", I exclaimed.
567 "Guess we have to go to this address, Farley, then find out where these boxes are coming from.  I hope we'll be able
568 to re-assemble him.  Ian wouldn't like to lose such a good AI specimen."
569 "IAN wouldn't like it?  *I* wouldt like it.  Listen, let's find this place.  I think these are the second-to-the-last

571 "We've been chasing after this van all day, Farley.  A tired agent soon becomes a dead one.  Come on, let't get back
572 to some comfortable quarters at the NET offices.  We'll start early tomorrow."

577 Some people lose their borders; people are poaching on my Concept.
578 'Mini-quiz-mistress' - I suppose it's not something simple like the 1/2 oz
579 gumballs are only 80% the size of the 1 oz balls?
580 A somewhat more complicated method is to take 1 ball from machine #1,
581 2 balls from maching #2 .......10 balls from machine #10.  Put them all on
582 the scale at once.  The number of 1/2 ozes is the number of the machine 
583 producing light balls.  Aaarrgg!  The total weight should be 55 ounces.  
584 The difference between the actual weight and 55 ozs, in 1/2 ounce
585 units, is the number of the machine producing the underweight gumballs.
586 (i.e. if the actual weight is 52.5 ounces, that is 2.5 ounces light, 
587 which is 5  1/2-ounce units.  That means that machine number 5 is defective).
588 You actually only need to use the gumballs from 9 machines. If the weight is
589 right on, the 10th machine is the culprit, but in that case you have to start
590 counting from 0.
591     I'm curious to see your solution. Or is this one of those trick questions?
