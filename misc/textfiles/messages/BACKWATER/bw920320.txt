 28 Oh yeah, it was about my hard disk being gone.  It was no big deal, really,
 29 'cause I'd already wiped one out early on when we first got them (which is
 30 a whole 'nother story in itself, having to do with the OTHER union bldg 
 31 rep).  User Services just said "so sorry," but I knew there must be some-
 32 thing SOMEONE can do ... and sure enough there was.  I got the resident
 33 genius to help me and he said I'd better learn about backups.  Well, I'd
 34 heard User Services use both "backup" and "copy" and when I called to 
 35 find out the difference (DOS manuals made no sense to me), they told me
 36 to take their DOS class, which I already had.  And then they called my
 37 supervisor and told her I was rude and that if I wanted any further info
 38 from them, I'd have to write letters.  Which is a whole 'nother story.
 39 But Nancy did come and give me a backup demo.  My only concern the second

 43 Actually I should start at the beginning.  See, I'd gotten these tickets
 44 to the big computer show at the coliseum and I'd arrived there late and my
 45 hair was soaking wet because I'd had to walk a long way to get the free
 46 shuttle that was spposed to take me there.  So there was only about left
 47 on the last day, so I'm walking around kinda fast and I stop at this booth
 48 that was just showing a word processing program.  I'd used WordStar for two
 49 years by that time, and since most of my work was columns and WordStar 
 50 hardly DID columns (and their upgrades only made it worse), I stopped, and
 51 lo and beehold, I KNEW the woman.  Anyway, she had 2 masters AND a law
 52 degree (one masters in public administraton BTW), and she showed me Word
 53 Perfect.  So the rest of our department was gonna get computers and they
 54 asked me to attend a meeting w/User Services to show them what kinda word
 55 I'd been doing on the computer so they could fit a program to our best
 56 use.  As it happened, I had a temporary job at the BESC that summer, right
 57 down the hall from User Services as a matter of fact, so naturally I asked
 58 about maybe previewing their copy of WordPercect, thnking that it was of
 59 course being considered beings as how it was only $125 and WordStar was
 60 $399.  For some reason they kept putting me off, never saying it wasn't
 61 even being considered until one day I was sitting down there discussing
 62 this project I was doing for the new administrator I wa working for over
 63 there and when I brought up WordPerfect User Services specialists started
 64 crawling outta the woodwork for everywhere practically tellng me never to
 65 mention that word again.  Well, I thought they were a bunch of bullies and
 66 I tried to get outta there as soon as I could.  I was real confused,
 67 though, because I noticed other people at the BESC *were* using Word
 68 Perfect and it kinda made me mad.  Know what I mean???

 73 It wasn't just me who was upset.  Just after she'd done the in-house
 74 effeciency check on our department, I ran into Nancy Eliot at the
 75 Dixon Street Diner and she was furious about not being allowed to use
 76 Lotus 123 and even more furious that two music teachers and a kinder-
 77 garten teacher <that's what SHE said> had the power to make such a 
 78 decision.  But that fall, her report included a letter from Bob Williams
 79 stating it was district policy that everybody HAD to use WordStar.  When
 80 I talked to her years later to get a copy of my questionnaires, she said
 81 something about submitting my supervisor submitting the information I'd
 82 given her about WordPerfect.  One of my Teachers on Special Assignment
 83 did eventually buy me WordPerfect but I could use in for only one of my
 84 five TSAs and when WordStar came out with its upgrade, the way it was
 85 installed there wasn't enough room for both programs (they wouldn't get
 86 me more memory either, even though the Electronics Shop said it would
 87 only cost about $50).

112 Interesting appointment, say the least.  I managed to get there on time
113 despite an irritating mishap with Tri Met where two buses came at the same
114 time, the second one an express, but the express passed me by.  Man was I
115 ever steamed!  Then I got to the ad building and was informed the meeting
116 was for tomorrow.  No comment.  She agreed to meeting me at 10:45 instead
117 of 8:15, which was right kind I though.  So I went out walking, carrying
118 my suitcase of documents.  Anyway, I ended up conversing with a Dr. Bop
119 who Said he was 18 days outta OSP after serving 18 years for hijacking a
120 plane to Cuba.  What fun!  He said if I was ever considering being home-
121 less I'd need alcohol, peroxide, and bleach and said I'd need to earn 
122 about $20 a day somehow if I didn't wanna eat at Baloney Joes.  He said he
123 was working on a 50-page book and told me I should do the same.  Either 
124 that or he'd go over my suitcase documents with me 'cause he was somewhat
125 of a jailhouse lawyer himself and then an attorney.  I told him I was 
126 going the accountability route right now.  He said I'd probably see him
127 around town, probably later, but I couldn't find him.   He told me you
128 clean your sneakers by pouring bleach over 'em and showed me the alcohol
129 he used for the scraches he always gets when he does yardwork for people
130 and that he was outta peroxide at the moment.  He said he was clean even
131 if he looked like a bum.  Said people loved him whether he had a tie on
132 or not.  He said in Cuba everybody just lives outside 'cause it's so warm.

136 Back so soon, you ask?  BTW, I *KNOW* there's grammmatical, spelling, and
137 typing errors above but hey, I'm on extended *vacation* right now (even
138 though it's not a VAcation as such, as the Ms. Dias who won the local
139 harassment suit will tell you).  Anyway, about the meeting .... We
140 kept going round and round about why I'd still be pursuing by grievances
141 (my little cause, she called it) against the District and then she kept
142 trying to show me the errors in my thinking.  When that didn't work (*I*
143 think I had equally as logical and more real arguments), she tried to
144 pull Trump by saying she was a counselor at PSU ... at PSU, I thought,
145 AND a neighbor of Eleanors.  When that didn't phase me, she threw in she
146 was currently working with Randi Nalon Posts at Marshall on some children's
147 project, like THAT was supposed to phase me.  She said I should "try to be
148 a politician" if I wanted to "change the world" and "dictate policy" but
149 I said I could probably achieve alot more by running as a union rep in-
150 district.  I could have alot of leverage after what all I'd been through.
151 After all, I said, that's what happened before in the union only the rep
152 was on the other side. (I know I'll suffer from the boon bestowers on that
153 one ... )

159       I might do just as well as some <grin>. We also got on self-esteem
160     issues and drugs and all. Since she'd smugly suggested I become "a

162    could probably do best at the district level.  I wouldn't let them tell

164    90% your reaction," which was twisted in a Personnel memo to me of 11/88

174 I'll clean up that last entry later; I'm too excited right now.  These
175 stonewall encounters with community pillars just drive me nuts.  I think
176 the only reason Carol agreed to an appointment THIS time is because I
177 mentioned the Grant Cluster "lynching," which I stated to her sounded too
178 much like too many events I'd witnessed and suffered through in my 10 
179 years with the District.  See, she'd denied the executive session the
180 then-current Board pamphlet said was the only way to deal with "personnel
181 matters" so I'd written down almost everything I could think of, saving
182 some savory morsels for "another time," and had it delivered to her in
183 the board meeting that was to consider "my little cause."  Of course,
184 the results were already posted in the board minutes for that meeting
185 (along with a rescinsion of another miscarriage of justice that HAD
186 dealt with) and I was already "released" (as Mr. Rieke so euphemisticallly
187 stated to me when I presented the document to him after Carol hadn't
188 bothered to respond).  And about the response ... when I called her she
189 had told me she thought Dr. Prophet had taken care of the matter but in
190 the meeting today she said I never called her back, even though I had 
191 left several messages on her home messagemachine and even more at the
192 Board office.  And when she didn't show up this morning and the admin-
193 istrative assistant had me talk to her on the phone to arrange for
194 another appointment, she begged me to leave some documentation so she'd
195 be better prepared, like the stuff I'd submitted to Rieke (a revised
196 version of what I gave her).  But I told her I thought there was a 
197 confidentiality problem what with public information being right there
198 in the same office and all.  Then in the meeting she stated somehow 
199 she'd magically found the copy Steven Kafoury had claimed he lost (and
200 Carol said he'd probably shredded when I mentioned confidentiality) and
201 it was locked in a safe place in the Board office.  So she must have
202 prepared herself with it during the time she couldn't meet with me.
203 But really, it sounded like she'd really done a lot more than two hours
204 research because she was mentioning she said she'd discussed with way-
205 former board members.  Overall, she tried to steer strictly clear of
206 the REAL reason she gave me an appointment this time so I'll have to 
207 write her "certified" to make sure it's made a part of my complaint.

210 What I was trying to get at with Carol, in presenting my material in person,
211 was that district behavior oftentimes is not too different from other gang
212 behaviors, and when I releavled to the EAP and others what was going on and
213 some of what I wa sgoing through, they'd ask what "I took" to get through it.
214 I think if they'd all study what's BEHIND drug addiction and gang membership,
215 they might figure out somethings wrong with our schools and workplaces.  
216 And they might figure out we don't just need more cops and oppression, we
217 need effective, supportive schools andworkplaces.  Then people might could
218 COPE better at home and little children wouldn't be killed by their parents
219 (10 children in the first 10 weeks of this year, folks).  I don't do drugs
220 and don't drink, but I sure wouldn't have been able to cope with kids while
221 dealing with the stuff I did at the district.

309 STAGNATION: The forces in nature are in a stae of perfect and undiscrimina-
310 ting impasse.  THere is no responsive action between things and nothing
311 productive can be accomplished. The natural order that nourishes and fosters
312 all things is disjointed and disunited. The lines of communication are down.
313 Because of this there is no understanding of what is needed and growth 
314 cannot continue. When growth stops, STAGNATION begins.  Any useful insights
315 or ideas you may have will be met with apathy and rejection. The atmosphere
316 is unreceptive even to altruistic and unselfish energies. Whether you vol-
317 unteer the whole of your resources to a worthwhile social cause, you can
318 accomplish nothing.  STAGNATION is a reservoir of arbitrary and absurd
319 misunderstandings.  STAGNATION produces an ambiance of decay and decadance.
320 Inferior persons and ideas can rise t positions of great influence. The
321 political andsocial environment can become corrupt indeed and there is
322 little a person of principle can do to turn the tide. Leaders are not in
323 touch withthe people whom they lead, and social systems become irrelevant.
324 The people become lost in a labyrinth of discordant purpose and are filled
325 with mistrust. Things come to a standstill and people, therefore, cannot

342 Interesting timing, I would say, the article about district "squirmishes"
343 and all.  THE NWREL study tactics sound so familiar.  I think they even
344 got some special award the year of that study, presented by a Kathy Aims,
345 So I turn on my TV this AM and what've we got ... NWREL.  An inspiring
346 program (looks like one of those well-ventilated conference rooms where
347 it's a real battle to stay awake) and sounds like a real "strategic" plan.
348 Since "central office" will still maintain "control" on "personnel", I 
349 wonder who's responsible if you get a school administrator like Dan Klee??
350 I suppose the "goals" will also be dictated by some computer "test," huh.
351 And guess what???  Lincoln and Wilson's goal will always require so much
352 more money, huh.  And with biannual school administrator musical-chair

358 I guess that is just another one of those coincidences, though, about
359 Cassandra and all because when our department was first getting computers,
360 I met was asked to meet w/Cassandra and Paul to show them the kind of work
361 I do, you know ... 'cause I'd used WordStar for two years already.  See,
362 most of my work was columns and columns on WS was much like a video game,
363 which you can't play very well if you're interrupted every two minutes,
364 you know.  So anyway I had been shown WordPerfect, but I'd also mentioned
365 the Macs Reed had donated to the district and Cassandra said they'd gone
366 to Wilson ... the Science Dept. she Said, but probably Rob Melton got one
367 'cause he's such a pro now and all (that's not sarcastic, BTW ... he's
368 gotten national awards).  See stuff on the Mac looked typeset even back
369 then and they did graphics and all.  But WordPerfect was too, and we cudda
370 saved $250 per program over WS but....

441 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Sorry, more stray thoughts ... one of these days
442 I'll focus ... promise.  But abot this site-based management (there was
443 a letter to the editor about this today), I was flipping thru the cable
444 stations and came upon that ever-so-inspiration Texas(armpitoftheWorld)-
445 based education station and they were talking about the wonders of this
446 "system," trying to dispel complains that there was more bureaucracy than
447 ever and that the principal was either processing paperwork or out of the
448 building in "meetings."  And they were saying that yes, for the first
449 five years it may "seem" that way (ha), but it evens out after that. But
450 with PPS already shoving "accountability" (ha ha) on to the unions, who
451 have no obligations other than to collect obligatory dues and make sure
452 you're paid just enough w/Strings Attached with "bad parents" equally as
453 culpable, this new "management" system seems to look like another

511 MOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOM Hi guys, I'm back again! MOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMO
512  
513 And like the NWREL studies, I've always wondered how much the reclassifi-
514 cation of classified personnel ended up costing over the years of evalua-
515 tion, re-evaluation, and re-evaluation of the re-evalusations.  Up front
516 that is.  I know the REAL cost could never really be calculated, what
517 with all the meetings the union held with employees during work time and
518 all helping employees "add" things to otheir job descriptions to make it
519 sound more high-falutin and meetings to explain why everybod but the 
520 executive-administrative classified staff came out so low (I think they
521 were finally just removed from "classified" status and don't have to pay
522 into the "union" system ... that's how that one was solved, I think).  
523 Even though I didn't attend the meetings (actually I wasn't invited 
524 because even though I had to pay the obligatory dues, I didn't, like
525 many other classified staffers, officially "join"), another secretary
526 gave me the information they were circulating, which were the evaluations
527 and re-evaluations of secretaries who'd been classified higher.  I guess
528 what our department was supposed to do is just insert nice-sounding 
529 rhetoric from those into our re-evaluated re-evaluations.  But I remember,
530 too, that those secretaries who felt they'd been royally screwed over, we
531 allowed to do the usual musical-chair switches that were against union
532 contract.  Of course, I was ineligible because Personnel felt I was un-
533 transferrable because I'd made complaints about a former dysfunctional
534 office even though the union told me, when they wanted to settle my four
535 year-old grievances strictly thru Dr. Taylor (without hearings), that I
536 was "the best 'computer-operator' in the district" (a point upon which I
537 immediately corrected them ... not only because I didnt have the hard-
538 ware or software to be able to make any progress, but I knew that the
539 entire Maintenance Department secretarial crew, for one, was totally
540 excellent and enthusiastic.  
541  
542 In one work-time meeting I *did* attend, I *did* ask Randi if it would
543 not have made more sense to rewrite PPS job descriptions first, before
544 all the baloney was added, so that classified staff could expand on those
545 duties from there.  TO start adding items like "budget forecasting" seems
546 out of the realm of responsibility *and* "culpability/accountability" for
547 a mere secretary, just as "making appointments" for five separate TSAs
548 (and making sure to remind them of their meetings .. making *me* account-
549 able) as demanded by Susan Larsen in the illegal meetings held in my 
550 department for the good part of a year.  Even though she stated "her
551 secretary" made "her appointments," when I tried to make an appt w/Susan
552 I was told it was "impossible" to keep someone else's "calendar,"
553  
554  
555 Blather on .... it's all become so complicated because nothing was DONE.

557 MOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMO If nothing else, it SHOULD prove interesting ... MO MO
558  
559 After reading this AM's paper, noting the reference to "the hearings 
560 process," I become even more suspicious.  But to state this whole thing
561 came about because of the BUF strike, seems insulting ... but the typical
562 twisted MO I've always seemed to witness in my now 12-year association w/
563 district officialdom.  Since Marshall was cited as an exemplary worksite
564 by NWREL as part of their initial "study," why weren't they chosen as a
565 part of the "pilot project" I wonder to myself?  or as *The* pilot project??
566 We might have been assured of some integrity.  But it also seems amazing 
567 about the timing.  Now that the re-evaluations of the re-evaluated re-eval-
568 uations are done and new job descriptions formed on that basis to add
569 numerous specific and impossible "accountabilities" to the already vague
570 "anything within reason" (which OFT states is anything short of being 
571 asked to jump out a second-story window or some such thing ... according
572 to State Statute) and the new probably equally as inane 4-year "Contract"
573 has been signed off, seems almost diabolical to change the entire dynamics
574 of the positions/classifications upon which all this nonsense is based.
575 But Who am I to say?  You know ....

585 And in Other Interesting Developments, at the inspiration of a BBSr on
586 another Board I became obsessed with a wildflower planting for the right
587 of way in front of my house, and figuring it's the least they could do,
588 called the city to see if I could have some of their seed.  That was three
589 days ago, and I got nothing BUT help from them ... immediate help as a 
590 matter of fact.  And they even called back 2x to my 1 call.  So today, I
591 hear what sounds like a backhoe (the Another "New Development" type of
592 sound, yaknow) so I investigate and what's happening out here IS .... on
593 the land COP "stole" from Mary Montague for backtaxes after she was widowed,
594 you know, they're gonna make into a wildflower test garden!!!!  How neat and
595 what a coincidence.  Only one problem, as I can see it, WHAT access are
596 they gonna use??? There's no roads in there and the unpaved roads in front
597 of our houses is like 20' wide.  If they're gonna bring hoardes of "strem
598 snitch" kids thru here, they're gonna wanna improve the access somehow.  And
599 I'm sure we all want the traffic down here.  And I also wonder why immediate
600 neighborhoods are not informed of these things.  Oh well, it still sounds
601 nice.  Sure seemed like a fire hazard, teen hangout, and being two blocks
602 off Barbur *and* the freeways to Everywhere, a right fine (and known) camp

675 ???? Of course, Hosford's woe could show to go that site-based management
676 *COULD* also work, if there WAS proper balance between management/board/
677 unions, since the community and too few courageous teachers did have the
678 integrity of conviction to go beyond fears of stonewalled responses and
679 police state reprisals. And it *did* point to the Board's typical response
680 to problems, which always causes further complication beyond imagination.
681 But to have Both the admin & board state (among other things) it was all
682 "only a Personnel matter" and of "concern" only to and by Personnel, in my
683 humble opinion, goes right to the core of the Complication <- which is the
684 THeme of the PPS Board "guidelines/mission statement" publication.

705  
706 My turn. Fasten your seatbelts kids. This is a heck of a story, because it's
707 true. 
708  
709 Six mnths ago I gave up trying to find a real job in Portland and went back to
710 delivering pizzas. Finances were extremely ticght from being unemployed for 
711 far too long. I hooked up a second job with temp service. So I was slamming
712 from one job into the next with out room to breathe or think, when I saw
713 someone I knew out of the corner of my eye. That's what I thought, anyway.
714  
715 Tuns out not to be my long lost friend but someone who looks remarkably alike.
716 I began to think he might make a good love interest, but soon found out that
717 he was afamily man. Four and a half years of marriage and two kids. So, I 
718 started to think he'd be a great friend. We were both working two jobs and
719 time for friendship was scarce, but we managed.
720  
721 Then he said it. "I've bee thinking about the 'D' word." I nearly wrecked 
722 the car I was driving at the time. I knew his marriage was rocky at best, 
723 and that it had been from the start. I had occassionally wished that he 
724 were available, but had NOT expected this!
725  
726 We continued to see each other as "friends" but we both knew that much more 
727 was waiting to break from just beneath the surface. Barely remembering 
728 right from wrong, we spent many hours together instead of sleeping. 
729  
730 The Christms season approached and I left Oregon for a week to go home to Mom.
731 While there, she offered to pay off ALL debts and send m through college, IF
732 I agreed to move home for at least 2 years. I didn't know what to say. I 
733 *loved* Oregon, but Ihad no future there the way things were going. I decided
734 to say OK.
735  
736 When I arrived back in Oregon, "he" met me at the airport. He'd jut moved out
737 of the slimey little house his family called home. We had a place to be and he
738 was on his way to a divorce. (The aforemetioned "d" word) So we did what 
739 came naturally and turned loose what we had suppressed for so long. We lived 
740 almost inseperably for about two weeks. Then his housemate returned. 
741  
742 Finally, I talked him into giving his marriage another try. I met his wife, 
743 and I acted as a marriage counselor to both of them. Then I took a look at
744 what I was doing, realized I was working very hard in the opposite direction
745 from what I wanted most, and quit. He was back with his family, I'd done
746 the right thing. There was no need to torture myself further. I tried to go
747 on with my life.
748  
749 He stopped by my pizza place during his lunch hours, and called me almost
750 every day. There was something mssing. As if the life was being sucked out
751 of him, he looked "monotone". I asked if this was what he really wanted, and
752 if he was happy with his life. He assured me that he was fine. I nodded and
753 turned back to my work.
754  
755 Some days later, on a dark and stormy night, I sat in the living room of 
756 a friend's apartment. The phone rang. It was my last BF's new GF calling to
757 announce their engagement. I felt suddenly that everyone in the world was
758 falling in lov and getting married and leaving me alone. I excused myself, 
759 and sat in my car crying. Finally, I headed home, where a wonderful house
760 mate handed me a glass of wine and told me not to worry about it.
761  
762 Leaving my home to give another friend a ride south that evening, there was
763 yet another car that looked like "his" coming toward me from the other side
764 of the intersection. In the rain it even looked like th car flickered its
765 lights at me. Iwas in teh middle of telling myself not to be so folish, when
766 the offending vehicle turned through a red light in front of me and onto a 
767 side street. The light turned green and I began to pull away, when someone
768 got out of the car and began to chase me. I stopped. It was him.
769  
770 I openned the car door. When I asked him what he was doing, he said, "Looking
771 for you! I've looked everywhere; called all your friends, I've driven to all
772 your usuall places. I've been worried sick. What's wrong?"
773  
774 I told him what had gotten me so upset, and we discussed the strangeness of 
775 his being aware of my desire to see him. At that moment, I believe, we gave
776 in to our feelings for each other. So glad to have found each other again, we
777 said "to hell with ethics" and acted in our own best interests. 
778  
779 Later that evening, when we had picked up my friend who wanted a ride, I said "
780 "If life continues to be like this, I'm going to quit."
781  
782 I'll tell you the rst later...

804 Interesting comment by Phil Keisling about educational malpractice.  Now
805 that I have an absolutely CLASSIC letter of Board Member Turner (also a
806 social worker/psycholigist at PSU) that reflects to a T exactly what I
807 was trying to point out to the entire Board about executive behavior/
808 attitudes .... all of which SHOULD constitute educational malpractice.
809 Funny thing that Lauri should be working for him, what with her long-
810 time association with the district/board/whatever.  Then, too, with the 
811 article on Jerry Wilson in the same Sunday Forum section, it dawned on
812 me that the school board now seems to be all made up of lawyers and 
813 "power" company concerns (one both <-grin> with one developer thrown in.
814 But I wonder why the Wilson article didn't mention activities prior to
815 Soloflex that most probably "enabled" him/them to "start" w/so much

889 ****************************************************************
890   The Portuguese were well aware of the curvature of the earth.
891 In fact it was a very pressing problem at the time. They had 
892 been making longer and longer explorations down the coast of 
893 Africa. This caused them problems because the standard 
894 navigational method at the time was rather crude. It consisted 
895 of sighting on the North Star which told them how far down the 
896 coast they were. The problem was that they were begining to 
897 lose it as a reference as they approached the equator. They 
898 needed very much to come up with a new navigation system that
899 was not dependant upon such a limited view point. They were
900 using the latitude/longitude system already, as laid out in 
901 Ptolemy's Geographica. All they really needed was a better 
902 system to know the latitude and longitude they were at. 
903 At the time, they were navigating in the southern Atlantic 
904 using a combination of the sun and the North Star. 
905 When they ran into a "large landmass" to the west they knew 
906 that it was something new. That's why Portuguese is spoken 
907 today on the Eastern side of South America. 
908   When Chris C. sailed off to try to find the new spice route 
909 to Japan, he carried with him a copy of Toscanelli's map which 
910 showed him how to get there. The map was created from a 
911 combination of information that Toscanelli had put together from
912 a multitude of sources, including the efforts of the Portuguese
913 and Marco Polo. Toscanelli's main input was that instead of 
914 labeling the area "Terra Incognita" (unknown lands) as Ptolemy
915 of Alexandria did, Toscanelli projected that there was 6500 miles 
916 of ocean there (based on the information he got from the Portuguese. 
917 He based that on the knowlege of the curvature of the Earth being 
918 about 75 miles per degree at the equator, and calculating from 
919 that based on the land mass that was currently known. His main 
920 error came from the incorrect size that Macro Polo had provided 
921 about the size of the Asian continent.
922   In 1440 Cardinal Nicholas wrote his Reconciliation of Opposites.
923 In it he wrote; "If the universe is infinite then the Earth in not 
924 necessarily, or even possibly at the centre. And if that is so, 
925 the Earth may well be circling the Sun. It is only the viewpoint 
926 of the observer as he stands on the Earth that makes him think 
927 it the centre of the universe. The same would be true of anybody 
928 standing on the Moon or on any one of the stars and planets there 
929 might be in the universe. And if everything were relative to 
930 everything else, the only way to know where you were on the Earth 
931 or on a planet, would be to measure the 'elsewhere'."
932   As you can see, the argument at the time was not whether the
933 Earth was flat or round, but rather whether the Earth was circling 
934 the Sun or the Sun circled the Earth. With the Earth circling the 
935 Sun becoming the favored belief by those with sufficent knowledge.
936 Interestingly, the discovery of the Americas did a lot to change
937 that belief. Since the Bible made no mention of the American 
938 continent, it put to question the completeness of truth as revealed 
939 in the Bible. It wasn't until the 1500's when Copernicus wrote his 
940 "Little Commentary", which later was published as "On the Revolution 
941 of the Celestial Spheres." That the argument became heated public 
942 debate. 
943    The issue of the Earth being flat or round was nothing by contrast
944 to the issue over whether the earth moved and that it was not the
945 center of the universe. Aristotle had said two thousand years before 
946 that the Earth was a sphere. "Because that was a perfect shape and
947 because its shadow could be seen on the moon."
948    The issue of movement and universal centering though was much more
949 of a difficult hurdle to overcome. The Bible stated flat out that the
950 Earth did not move "The world is established that it cannot be moved."
951 This is why the wierd and bizzare orbital patterns for the planets and 
952 the Sun existed for so long. It was an attempt to force the Biblical 
953 account to fit with observed fact. Essentially, Copernicus said; 
954 "I don't care whether the Earth moves or not by Biblical account. 
955 What I care about is that the math works out. Pope Gregory then used
956 the "new math" to revise the calandar in 1582 to the form that we 
957 use today.
