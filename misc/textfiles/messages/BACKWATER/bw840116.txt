22      I FEEL MUCH RELIEVED, SITTING IN THE INN, DRINKING A TEA OF SASSAFRAS
23 ROOT GIVEN ME BY A KIND YOUNG MAN.  I FIND THAT IT HAS CALMED ME, AND GIVEN
24 ME A CLEARER HEAD FOR THINKING OVER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME.  I HOPE THAT
25 YOUTHFUL APPRENTICE WILL COME IN TODAY, SO I MIGHT THANK HIM FOR HIS BENE-
26 VOLENT GESTURE.
27 
28      I THOUGHT THAT THE SPECTRE'S NAME WAS MIDER, BUT I NOW KNOW THAT ONE
29 SUCH AS MIDER WOULD HAVE NO INTEREST IN ME, AT LEAST IN LIFE.  I HAVE NOTH-
30 ING THAT WOULD TEMPT HIM FROM HIS HOME, NOR IS MY SPIRIT SO GREAT AS TO
31 ATTRACT HIM HERE.  BESIDES, HIS POWER IS SUCH THAT HE COULD TAKE ME IF THAT
32 WERE HIS WISH.  IT'S NOW CLEAR TO ME THAT MY SPECTRE IS NOTHING BUT A SIMPLE
33 BWBACHOD, PWCCA, OR EVEN AN MISCHEVOUS GAN CEANACH.  SHE MERELY CHOSE THIS
34 TIME TO MAKE HERSELF KNOWN BECAUSE OF MY ILLNESS, AND HER TRICKS WERE NAUGHT
35 BUT ILLUSION.  SO THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS TO MAKE OF HER A FRIEND.  I CERTAINLY
36 CANNOT GET RID OF HER, NOR WOULD I WANT TO NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND WHO SHE IS.
37 THAT SHE WOULD FOLLOW ME HERE, AND ATTEMPT TO DRAW MY ATTENTION, IS QUITE A
38 COMPLIMENT, AND THE ONLY PROPER THING IS TO ATTEMPT TO RETURN THE FAVOUR, IF
39 I CAN.
40 
41      "PAM?"...I COME OUT OF MY REVERIE TO SEE THE YOUNG APPRENTICE WHO RE-
42 CENTLY LEFT ME THIS MARVELOUS TEA!  AS I LISTEN, I REALIZE THAT ONCE AGAIN,
43 MY GREAT FAILING OF COMMUNICATION HAS STRUCK AGAIN.  MY WORDS COMPLIMENTING
44 YOU AND YOUR MASTER OF THE GENTLE WAYS REFERRED NOT TO THE WAYS OF HEALING,
45 BUT OF MANNERS AND GRACIOUSNESS, WHICH ARE STRANGERS TO SO MANY THESE DAYS.
46 PLEASE, SIT AND SPEAK WITH ME, I WOULD RELISH YOUR COMPANY!

50    The piper walked slowly down the bank of the small stream, fingers dancing
51 on the chanter of the handsom stand of pipes on his right shoulder.  His eyes
52 were slightly abstracted, he had nearly entranced himself with playing.  The
53 music formed a nearly visible bubble around him as he walked.  Inside, was 
54 the air slightly more invigorating? the sun brighter?  did the glints from
55 dew laden branches have more and richer colors?
56  
57    As he walked, he felt the barriers between this world and others thin.  
58 Intrigued, he piped first closer to one world, then to another.  He realized
59 that he needed some type of guide, and the only one available was his wits.
60 
61    Wait-- had that been a flicker of movement in the shadow before him?  He
62 let the sound of the pipes die and the feeling of being solidified.  With a
63 smile on his lips, and a twinkle in his eyes he waited.  If someone were here,
64 surely he or she would make it known if they wanted company.

67 Milady, I see that my master is correct once again. I must stop jumping to
68 conclusions. I fear I mis-read thy note. I do thank thee for the compliment
69 regarding my manners.
70 	Wouldst thou tell me more regarding these 'spirits'? I thought one of the names
71 was faintly familiar. Is a PWCCA anything like a Pooka? I recall well the tale
72 told of one called 'Harvey'.
73 	Thou might enjoy a tome I have oft perused. It is called either 
74 "The Glass Harmonica" (in hardcover), or "The Book of Weird". It was written by 
75 Barbara Ninde Byfield.  It deals with witches, trolls, elves, dwarves, and many 
76 other topics. I must also add that it contains the remedy that I sent
77 thee!
78 
79 	It is a most wondrous compendium of the strange, humorous, and bizarre. Yet it 
80 is also the best single source for many details regarding everyday life in a 
81 world such as this.
82 	I await with great interest thy tales.

91      Marck awoke in the dark with the sound of the rain beating on 
92 the glass of the cockpit.  Below, he could just make out the dark mass
93 of seemingly endless forest sliding slowly by beneath them.  The forest!
94 Memories again flooded his mind of the Center, set in the middle of the
95 forest.  Ben banked the craft and began his descent.  Soon Marc could
96 see the low, wide buildings clustered together against the ageless
97 wood from which they were made.  He would be home in moments.  Marc
98 looked up at Ben and immediately noticed the change in his companion.
99 His face was stony, remote, completely devoid of emotion, unreadable
100 even to Marc's trained senses.
101      He was about to ask why when he was interrupted by the bump of the
102 speeder landing next to one of the larger buildings of the complex.
103 The doors hissed open against the pressure and they both climbed out.  Ben
104 ran under the eaves of the building, and Marc stood beside the trees for
105 a moment, regaining his bearings.  The forest was so alive! Before
106 it had seemed empty, but his increased empathy told him of all the
107 living things around him now.  He was about to lose himself to the 
108 draw of so many things pressing in all around when Ben called to him.
109      "Marcus! Come now.  We must meet the others inside."  Marc turned
110 and studied Ben's face.  Still no hint as to what was going on inside.
111 He turned and followed after Ben into the building.  It was almost as
112 if it were planned, Marc thought as he approached the lights at the end
113 of hallway, that it had rained last night for the first time in weeks
114 and cleaned him up a bit to meet the others.  For the first time he
115 realized that he was dirty.  And naked.
116      The room at the end of the hall was a gallery, with seven men
117 and women seated on the floor across the hall from him, and several
118 dozen more in the balcony above.  In the center of the hall was a 
119 large raised platform.  There were no other furnishings to be seen.
120 Marc studied the people around him carefully, but they all exhibited the
121 same rock solid Nothing that ben was showing.  Why?

130     As he strolled down the long staircse, Contremon allowed himself
131 a quiet chuckle.  The dwarf would save the Inspector, embroiling
132 McKane in yet another complication without seriously endangering
133 Contremon's own position.  He fingered the gold key again, nervously.
134 After dinner there would be plenty of time, and then finally
135 they would pay for what they had done.

141      He walked unseeing down the shabby corridor.  Those who passed gave him
142 wide berth...a fierce gleam in his eyes diverted any who would speak with
143 him.  The dark visions from the evening before had only strengthen his resolve
144 to get to the bottom of this case.  He paused slightly at a doorway, a grim
145 smile on his lips.
146      As the Inspector entered the darkened room, he noted his aide off to the
147 side.  A single bright lamp blazed on a man manacled in a straight-backed
148 chair in the center of the room.  Bare to the waist...scars from old battles
149 criss-crossed his torso.  It was evident he had felt the taste of both blade
150 and bullet and survived.  His startling blue eyes shone with the glimmer of
151 fanaticism.
152      The Inspector spoke; "Mohammed, I see you're getting a little careless--
153 two rookie patrolmen picking up the infamous Wassir.  They both will 
154 probably live.  Now I'll get some answers...tell me of Natasha and her
155 murder."
156      A sneer came to Mohammed's lips; "Ah Salazar, you (expletive deleted)
157 You can take your answers and (deleted) and then (censored) sideways.  As
158 for your mother, she is (deleted) (censored) (expletive deleted) <Oh My!!>.
159 And on top of that you're a crummy detective."
160      Salazar's open hand flashed out ...  CRACK!!!... Wassir's head snapped
161 back.  Slowly the Albanian broke into a bloody grin.  Chuckling softly;
162 "I see my favorite enemy hasn't lost his touch.  I will tell you a little
163 because it serves my ends.  Perhaps the Ninja killed Natasha.  How and why
164 you'll have to discover."
165      "Where is the Ninja now?"
166      "Try Marakesh, but beware death will stalk you there.  Trust only the
167 dwarf and perhaps Serena if you should meet.  You remember Serena?"
168      Salazar's mind flashed with images of the fair and deadly Serena...
169 his loins tightened.  He spoke; "What of McKane? What does he have to do
170 with this?"
171      "Natasha meant much to LeRoy, but he did not kill her.  He would destroy
172 her murderer himself, but he grapples with the Russian bear."
173      "Hm yes, Andropov." The inspector turned to his aide; "Release the 
174 Albanian...We're off to Marakesh."
175      His aide stammered; "But what about the kidnapping of the Russian.  
176 Shouldn't we interrogate him further on this matter?"
177      "We're policemen not spies.  I fear I would strangle that Russian pig
178 myself if I was given the chance."  Turning to Wassir, "Farewell old friend,
179 take care..."
180      Wassir smiled; "Farewell Inspector, but I'm sure we'll meet again before
181 this affair is finished."

192 CYM:
193 
194 Whether paid or not American politicians are treated like 
195 garbage. Politicians from small towns or counties, who receive 
196 little or no pay, are as abused by the public as those getting 
197 high salaries.
198 
199 I prefer my politicians to get a fair paycheck as a reminder 
200 whose interests they're working for. If I don't care enough to 
201 pay for what I'm getting why shouldn't they turn to someone 
202 who will?
203 
204 I admit politicians don't always work in what I would consider 
205 my best interest. But your theory seems to assume taking away 
206 their paycheck will inspire them to altruism and self-
207 sacrifice. This is not the way I observe human nature to 
208 work. But, then again, maybe I missed something.

225 I personally feel that the best way to have a fairly good chance at
226 having honest politians in Washington it should be similar to jury
227 duty.  If we are to be judged by our peers should we not be governed
228 by`our peers.  1 or 2 year terms with provisions that you are paid
229 the same amount that you would receive on your current position and
230 the guarentee that your job would be there when your term of duty
231 was complete.

233 The question would be if there are to minimum standards, who is to
234 decide what those standards are?????

240    But then again there are those who wouldn't be able to
241 work in the so called "jury duty office" simply because they
242 wouldn't know what to do at the job.  I certainly wouldn't
243 want the responsibility.  But then again maybe I, too, am
244 missing something.  Would you really want to participate

283      WELL, APPRENTICE, THE PWCCA IS A POOKA, BUT OF WELSH RATHER THAN IRISH
284 EXTRACTION.  BOTH ARE A BRANCH OF THE ELLYLLON, OR ELVES, AND ARE COMMON
285 THROUGHOUT THE LESS ANGLICIZED PORTIONS OF GREAT BRITAIN.  I AT FIRST TENDED
286 TO THINK THE MISCHIEF MAKER WAS ONE OF THESE, SINCE THEY TEND TO ENJOY BOTH
287 CREATING MINOR PROBLEMS FOR THEIR HOST AND FREQUENTLY APPEAR TO SOMEONE JUST
288 RETURNING FROM TRAVELING.  THEY PARTICULARLY ENJOY CREATING CONFUSION (WHICH
289 WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE) IN THEIR
290 HOST, AND TEND TO PICK ONE HOST AND REMAIN WITH THEM UNTIL THEY FEEL UNWEL-
291 COME.
292      THE GAN CEANACH IS ANOTHER IRISH ELF, WHO SPECIALIZES IN FILLING THE
293 EARS OF YOUNG WOMEN WITH PLEASANT FANCIES OR FRIGHTENING THOUGHTS, MOSTLY TO
294 THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING THEM FROM BEING BUSY WITH THEIR WORK.
295      THE OTHER I MENTIONED, THE BWBACHOD, IS A HOUSEHOLD SPRITE.  I DOUBT IF
296 ANY OF THESE LITTLE CREATURES IS THE SOURCE OF MY RECENT ADVENTURE, AS THEY
297 TEND TO PICK A HOUSE, RATHER THAN A PERSON, TO OCCUPY, AND SPEND THEIR TIME
298 HIDING THINGS, AND THEN RETURNING THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE.  I THINK I MAY HAVE
299 ONE OF THESE (MANY HOMES SEEM TO), BUT IF SO HE PROBABLY ISN'T THE SOURCE OF
300 IT ALL.
301      THERE ARE MANY OTHER SPRITES AND ELVES, BUT THESE ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO
302 MIGHT BOTHER ME IN THIS FORM.  I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY HEADLESS RIDERS, SO IT IS
303 NOT A DULACHAN.  I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE MOUNTAINS RECENTLY, SO THAT RULES OUT
304 THE GWYLLION AND THE COBLYNAU, AND SO ON.  I'LL CERTAINLY LOOK FOR THE TOME
305 YOU HAVE MENTIONED, IT MAY BE OF HELP TO ME IN DEALING WITH MY CONFRONTATION
306 TO COME.
307 
308      THE HOUR IS LATE, AND THE LONG CONVERSATION WITH THE APPRENTICE HAS
309 BEEN BOTH FRUITFUL AND ENJOYABLE.  HIS ADVICE HAS BEEN HELPFUL, AND HIS MAR-
310 VELOUS TEA HAS GIVEN ME THE STRENGTH FOR WHAT LIES AHEAD.  AS I STAND AT THE
311 DOOR, I SEE THAT IT HAS GROWN COLD, AND THE WIND HAS RISEN AS IF IN GRAND
312 EXPECTATION OF THE COMING MEETING BETWEEN ME AND THE INVADER OF MY PEACE.
313 WRAPPING MY CLOAK TIGHTLY TO MY BODY, AND HUGGING THE WEAPONS OF MY CRAFT TO
314 ME, I BEGIN THE LONG WALK TO MY HOME.  IT IS TO BE A WEARYSOME NIGHT, AND
315 CERTAINLY ONE OF SURPRISES IF THE HISTORY OF THE ELLYLLON IS TO BE A GUIDE.

319 I pass by the Inn but rarely, so I stopped to here the travelers tell
320 their stories of what is happening around.  I listened to the tales,
321 drank of the beer, and moved on.  On my Recorder I play to the beasts
322  of the woods, warning them of the dangers of man.  They call back telling
323 me of what the other travelers would not say at the Inn, and warning me too
324 that I should stay away from men.  But I can not, though the wood forever
325 would be my home, I must return to those of my kind to find from whence I came
326 and who I am.

332 are possible for one of my small talents (and lesser training). I will most

350 	Time Winds Tavern	by Teri Lee	(Those Were the Days)
351 	
352 Once upon the time winds was a tavern
353 Where strange folk could have a drink or two,
354 Reminding us of their immortal wonder.
355 I saw a unicorn there, didn't you?
356 (chorus)	Those days are gone, my friend;
357 		The need is at an end
358 		Of all those strange and mystic beasts of yore.
359 		The dragon's gone tonight, he went without a fight
360 		And left us here with science evermore.
361 
362 Unicorns sat perched among the bar stools,
363 Dragons parked their tankards on the floor,
364 Orcs and griffins fought for lovely maidens,
365 While imps and demons traded arcane lore.
366 	chorus
367 Witches once worked spells upon the tavern
368 To guard it from the sight of human eyes,
369 For mortals must not seek to know their betters:
370 What man can know the future and not cry?
371 	chorus
372 In the dark I sit alone and wonder,
373 Will they come and drink with us again?
374 The tavern waits in sawdust-covered splendor
375 To be filled with laughing creatures, who knows when?
376 	chorus
377 
378 ps	to all concerned, I won't leave more than 2 songs per disk (more likely 1)
379 To the apprentice, was I the "snatch of song" you refered to?

382 The Jury duty basis is what I had in mind but for a period of probably six
383 years, staggered of course. Each State would still have the same number of
384 people representing them but there would be an election/selection every year 
385 at the general election/selection time. If you were to serve you would be 
386 guaranteed you position that you were fro would be there at the end of your
387 tenure. That is of course if you still want it. NO persons that are employed
388 by companies doing business with the Federal Gov. would be eligible to serve nor
389 could those companies hire anyone that has been associated with the government
390 for a period of at least five/six years this would insure that no hanky panky
391 between ex and present government reps goes on. No sneaky back scratching 
392 allowed. There would also be a recall provision for the House and Senate. The
393 Cabinet would also be approved by the electorate not by the Congress. Advisors
394 would be recruited from the non-military private sector. Accadamia would be
395 probably the main source of advisors to the President, and Ambasadors also.
396 Well this is it for now. See what can be added to this (or subtracted). When
397 the debate is done I'll send hard copies to our present Lackies on the publik do
398 le!!

402 back-scratching, self-interest, and questionable competence, isn't it?
403 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
404 And ... can a change of a Lady's name hide her face, or, for some, her voice?
405 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dave ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
406 I'm sorry too, Dave: But the acadamia I refer to is not the same as the rotten
407 public school system as we now kbnow it. There are many qualified types in the
408 Higher education system, not all are corrupt, If you read my message throughly
409 you will note that I have given final approval of the cabinet and advisors to
410 US the electorate!

416 WELL, AT LEAST YOU ARE PROPOSING SOME SORT OF SOLUTION RATHER THAN JUST
417 BELLYACHING.  CONGRATS.  HOWEVER, I ALWAYS AGREED WITH JEFFERSON THAT
418 THE LESS GOVERNMENT, THE BETTER, WITH MY CORROLARY THAT THE SIMPLER
419 THE GOVERNMENT THE BETTER.  ALL OF THE COMPLICATIONS DERIVING FROM YOUR
420
427 THE PRESS THAT THE BAD ONES DO.  AND PARTICULARLY, I FEEL THAT MOST
428 OF THEM ARE *UNDERPAID*.

446 
447      THE CLEARING HERE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE WOODS WILL DO.  WIND CONTINUES
448 TO BLUSTER ABOUT ME, ITS FINGERS TEARING AT MY CLOAK IN EXPECTATION OF THE
449 RITES I WILL PERFORM.  I HAD HOPED THAT I WOULD NEVER NEED TO DON THE MANTLE
450 OF THE WITCH, BUT IT SEEMS THAT TROUBLE HAS FOUND ME UNSOUGHT, AND NOW WILL
451 ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW ME OF ITS OWN ACCORD.  WOULD THAT I HAD GIVEN MORE OF MY
452 ATTENTION TO MY DEAR GRANDMOTHER WHEN SHE TRIED TO TEACH ME THESE WAYS, FOR
453 I THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PREPARED FOR MY CURRENT PREDICAMENT.
454 
455      PRAISE THAT NONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM THE INN ARE HERE TO WATCH ME, FOR
456 WHAT MUST BE DONE NOW IS MUCH TOO PERSONAL, AND I WOULD BE TERRIBLY SHAMED
457 IF THEY SAW IT.  REMOVING MY CLOTHING, AND RELEASING THE STAYS FROM MY HAIR,
458 I STAND NAKED TO THE WIND THAT NOW BLOWS WITH CONSTANT FORCE FROM THE EAST.
459 IT IS SO COLD, BUT THE RELEASE FROM COVERING IS NECESSARY, AND INVIGORATING.
460 I FEEL ALIVE, SO ALIVE, AND MY PULSE POUNDS WITH THE JOY OF THE CLOSENESS TO
461 NATURE!  BUT I MUST BE ON WITH MY WORK......
462 
463      I PREPARE THE CAULDRON AND FIRE, AND PLACE THE MANDAL WHERE IT WILL BE
464 BEST. SEARCHING WITHIN MY WRAP ON THE GROUND, I REMOVE THE SMALL WAXEN DOLL.
465 IT IS MANLIKE, HAVING LIMBS AND BODY, BUT THE FACE IS BLANK.  UPON THE FACE
466 OF THE DOLL I WRITE WITH MY FINGERNAIL (FOR ONLY SOMETHING FROM MY OWN BODY
467 WILL DO FOR THIS RITE) THE WORD:
468
469                              "KASHSHAPTI"
470 
471 AND THEN HOLD IT OVER THE FLAMING CAULDRON.  NONE OF MY DEAR FRIENDS WOULD
472 RECOGNIZE THE SMALL, QUIET WOMAN THEY KNOW ME AS NOW, AS I SCREAM FIERCELY:
473 
474            "ATTI MANNU KASHSHAPTU SHA TUYUB TA ENNI!"
475 
476 AND THROW THE DOLL INTO THE FLAMES!  THE WORLD MOVES DREAMLIKE ABOUT ME AS I
477 BEGIN TO SINK INTO THE TRANCE AND GAZE INTO THE BLACK SMOKE THAT RISES FROM
478 THE BURNING DOLL.  SLOWLY, AS I KNEW IT WOULD, THE NAMES OF MY TORMENTER NOW
479 APPEAR WITHIN THE SMOKE:
480 
481                           "GAN CEANACH BARNEY"
482 
483 "BARNEY?!"  I EXCLAIM.  I KNEW THAT IT MIGHT BE A GAN CEANACH, BUT ONE WITH
484 THE NAME "BARNEY"?  IT SEEMS, SOMEHOW, ANTICLIMACTIC.  NO MATTER, THE RITUAL
485 MUST CONTINUE, FOR IT CAN BE DANGEROUS TO START SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND NOT
486 CARRY IT TO ITS PROPER CONCLUSION.
487 
488      I PREPARE THE MANDAL, AND PLACE THE FIGURE OF ISHTAR UPON THE ROTTEN
489 STUMP THAT I NOW USE FOR AN ALTER.  ONCE AGAIN, I STAND TALL (AS TALL AS MY
490 FRAME WILL ALLOW) AND BEGIN THE INCANTATION:
491 
492 	    "I, BY THE COMMAND OF QUEEN ISHTAR
493 	     AM CLOTHED IN TERROR
494 	     AM ARMED IN FIERCESOMENESS
495 	     AM ARRAYED WITH MIGHT AND THE SWORD
496 	     I MAKE THEE TREMBLE
497 	     I MAKE THEE RUN AFRAID
498 	     I DRIVE THEE OUT
499 	     I SPY THEE OUT
500 	     I CAUSE THY NAME TO BE KNOWN AMOUNG MEN
501 	     I CAUSE THY HOUSE TO BE SEEN AMOUNG MEN
502 	     I CAUSE THY SPELLS TO BE HEARD AMOUNG MEN
503 	     I CAUSE THY EVIL PERFUMES TO BE SMELT AMOUNT MEN
504 	     I UNCLOTHE THY WICKEDNESS AND EVIL
505 	     AND BRING YOUR SORCERIES TO NAUGHT!
506 
507 	     IT IS NOT I, BUT NANAKANISURRA
508 	     MISTRESS OF WITCHES
509 	     AND THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN ISHTAR
510 	     WHO COMMAND THEE!"
511 
512      SINKING BACK, EXHAUSTED FROM THE SPELL, I KNOW THAT SOON I WILL BE CON-
513 FRONTED WITH THE CREATURE, AND I HOPE THAT I WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO WIN
514 OUT OVER IT.
515 
516      "Now, that really wasn't very nice at all, honey."  a voice laden with
517 sarcasm calls out.  "Now ya gotta look at me too.  But ya ain't gonna git
518 rid o' me that easy!"
519      AS I TURN TO FACE MY TORMENTER, MY THOUGHTS TURN TO OLD FRIENDS.  WILL
520 I EVER HEAR THE VOICE OF d AGAIN?  PERHAPS I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO
521 HAVE LEFT THINGS AS THEY WERE.......

528 As I strolled alone in the night of the woods, my thoughts were torn from me
529 as I heard screaming nearby. I ran as quickly to the source as the foliage
530 would allow me. Dancing light presented itself to me just beyond some tall
531 tree, in the middle of a small clearing. And what do my wondering eyes see
532 as I run past the last of the obstacles? A sight that causes me to retreat
533 to the safety of behind the trees. A totally naked woman is prancing around
534 muttering strange incantations that make no sense to my city dweller ears.
535 But I know a nice body when I see one, so I stay around and watch the show.
536 Suddenly the womenan gets up again, and begins talking to something called
537 Barney, which sees fit to not make itself visible to bystanders, just to
538 the woman who obviously has its ear. I take out my flask, swig a drink,
539 and settle back amoung the trees to watch the spectacle, unseen, unheard,
540 and unnoticed.
541 	"This must be my lucky day", I say to myself. "We sure don't get
542 shows like this in town."
543 As the scene unfolds, my eyes can not believe what they are seeing. How 
544 much more of this will go on. Wait until I tell the boys back in town...
545 But will they believe me...Then I remember the image device I bought from
546 that vagabond who approached my door that one windy night. 
547 	"You never know when you might come apon a scene you want to
548 remember for the rest of my life", he said, thrusting the device toward
549 me. "And the price it too good to pass up", he continued. I gave him what
550 he wanted as much to get rid of him and get back to the warm fire as I did
551 to try out the new device.
552 
553 	"This will really come in handy, I only hope it works.", I think to
554 myself as I remove the image device from its pouch...

565      A mournful cry breaks the still night air
566      Quickly does follow the soul wrenching sobs
567      And a cry of hopeless despair
568 
     See there on the hollow log the figure sits
569      Head bowed down in pain
570      For the pain and the cry of great distress
571      Comes from this poor wretched soul
572 
     A wind begins its stiring sounds
573      And echos the mournful wail
574      While the trees around observe without sound
575      The figure who's soul is layed bare
576 
     It's over and through
577      And there is nothing left to do
578      So the lonly figure silently walks away

582 ***************************************************************
583 RETURNING FROM A LATE NIGHTS WORK I BEGIN TO PREPARE
584 FOR MY SLEEP. LOOKING TO THE SIDE I NOTICE A DISCARDED 
585 PEICE OF PAPER THROWN IN A TRASH BIN. STRANGE I THINK,
586 FOR I KNOW I HAD THROWN AWAY THE TRASH BEFORE I LEFT
587 I WONDER WHAT IT COULD BE? PICKING UP THE CRUMPLED 
588 SHEET. I OPEN IT UP TO FIND A NOTE SCRAWLED FROM
589 A PATRON WHO HAD COME ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE WHILE I WAS
590 AWAY ON BUSINESS. THE NOTE SPEEKS OF THE TROUBLE STUMBLING
591 AND TRIPPING OVER THE CLUTTER THAT LAYS ABOUT THE INN.
592 I MUST SAY THAT I AM SORRY TO HEAR OF THIS PROBLEM, FOR
593 I HAD THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CLEANER THEN THAT. BUT ALASS
594 IF THE PROBLEM IS THERE I SUGGEST THAT YOU PICK UP YOUR
595 SKIRTS AND GINGERLY STEP OVER THE CLUTTER FOR NOW, AND
596 I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. THE OBSTICAL THAT YOU SPOKE OF THAT 
597 MADE YOU TRIP IS CALLED A CONTROL S. FOR NOW I WOULD RECOMMEND
598 THAT YOU RAISE YOUR SKIRTS BY USING THE CC N. AND I WILL SPEAK
599 TO PAM AND OTHERS TO PLEASE NOT USE THE CONTROL S IN THIER
600 LAYABOUT IN THE INN, FOR IT SEEMS TO CAUSE OUR LADY OF DRAGONS
601 SPELL TO THIS LAND TO BE BROKEN. IF YOU NEED THE TIME FOR
602 YOUR OWN SPELL WEAVING I SUGGEST A CONTROL Q OR NULL.
603 THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP IN CLEANING THIS MESS UP.

608      WHERE ONCE THERE WAS FULLNESS, THERE NOW IS EMPTYNESS.  IN OTHER WORDS,
609 MIKEY DID A COMPRESS.  NOW THERE IS SPACE FOR ME TO WRITE, THOUGH I DON'T
610 HAVE MUCH TO SAY.  HAVING SO LITTLE SPACE IS A TRIFLE LIMITING, AS IT MUST
611 BE FILLED UP, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE SPACE IS SMALL AND IT IS HARD TO GET
612 A GOOD SUBJECT GOING HERE.
613 
614      WELL, I HAVE ELIMINATED ALL MY AWFUL CONTROL S CHARACTERS.  I THINK I
615 WILL USE CONTROL Q FROM HERE ON OUT, AS IT SEEMS TO BE THE BEST OPTION FOR
616 COMPLETE SAFETY.  I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR NULLS, BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S
617 NOT A PROBLEM, SO NULL AWAY FOLKS!
618 
619      WELL, d, ARE YOU STILL WITH US?  I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL ALL ALONE HERE!
620 AARON HAS LEFT FOR PARTS UNKNOWN, ANON IS REMAINING ANONYMOUS, HROTHGAR HAS
621 HEADED FOR THE HILLS, AND YOU ARE BEING SO QUIET THAT I WONDER IF YOU ARE
622 STILL WITH US.  DO YOU PLAN TO ENTER THE CURRENT FANTASY?  IT REMINDS ME SO
623 MUCH OF EARLIER TIMES WHEN YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MANY, AND I HID BEHIND
624 THE TABLES FOR FEAR OF SPEAKING UP.  NOW I YAMMER ON, BORING EVERYONE, AND
625 YOU ARE HIDING.  I REALLY MISS YOUR PRESENCE!  I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY
626 OTHER THINGS IN LIFE THAN THE INN AND ITS INHABITANTS, BUT IT IS A BIT OF
627 FUN.  PLEASE RETURN!  PLEASE?
