 26 I still exist(not that it mattered, but it IS fun to scream nonsensically)
 27  
 28 So. How is everyone's post-con-partum-depression going? Dont you think
 29 life should be a con? I DO!!!!!!!!!! Lets all work on this shall we?
 30  
 31 As far as the supreme being: All of us here at Elan call it/he/she/cosmic bran
 32 muffin the Infinite Is, with apologies to Richard Bach (see the book Illusions
 33 and maybe you will see the poetry in that)
 34 Yes, labels can be unnecessary and silly. But some of us need them.
 35  
 36 I don't know about how you all relate to the Supreme One. I think that that
 37 act itself is important, as it makes you part of a scheme. Anyway, I feel there
 38 is a Creator and it does respectfully request that we at least say "hi there".
 39 This I do by attempting to develop all my gifts to their fullest so that the
 40 act of my being created is not a great cosmic waste.
 41  
 42 And I think that's the extent of my religion for the time being. You worship/
 43 pray when you do well what you love to do best. You gratify the creator by 
 44 showing that the energy that went into your creation was well spent and not
 45 necessarily better spent by making rocks and a few more slugs.
 46 Maybe someday I'll elaborate on it. But maybe not.

 53      the story continues...
 54      "Not you, that damnd cat, ran off the ringhorn I'd been stalking!"
 55      "Thuva shairs that cat's cave like a friend.  I'd not be one to tell him
 56 that."  "Seemed less than pleased" Sheji added for good measure.
 57      "Shaires a cave with a cat?  Maybe he's a hunter like me.  Chulan I'm 
 58 called, with Jicha's carrivan."
 59      "I'm...  its been an odd day.  Can hardly believe it myself but I cant 
 60 seam to remember my own name."
 61      "Lots of people forget the  name their parrents gave them, 'specialy 
 62 arround here.  Thats why most give ourselves another as soon as were old enough
 63 to realize we want one.
 64      Best visit the temple first chance you get."
 65      Sheji was going to have to think about that one - later.  They had reached
 66 the road.
 67                                  - -
 68      The carrivans, there were three of them, were outside of anything he
 69 might havve expected.  Each carrivan consisted of three wagons, not too unlike
 70 the horse drawn deleveries of the early railroad era and before, except there 
 71 were no horses.  Instead they were linked, tounge of one behind to the one in
 72 front.  The very front wagon had no tounge, nothing in front at all.
 73      The wheels were an eclectic mix of pnumatic tyres on iron rims on wooden 
 74 spokes.  Of the three sets, from the roof of the lead van of one pprojected the
 75 end of a virtical boiler.  Appended to this was the steam whistle whose 
 76 screetch he had heard.  The driving benches ran the full width of each lead 
 77 van.  The only controls were a tiller, presumably to steer, and a single small 
 78 lever projecting from a cast iron box bolted to the wooden dash.  No guages, 
 79 lights, pedals, or switches, nothing.
 80      Master of all this was a portly middle aged man outlandishly dressed in
 81 bright silks and cottons.  He spoke quietly, calm and polite, ever mindfull
 82 of his workers dignity as of his own.  For every word that passed his lips, 
 83 some action was set in motion, quickly but without fuss.  Though his hunters
 84 returned without success, he displayed no sign of dissapointment.  Sheji was 
 85 welcomed and told where to sit.  In the midst of getting ready to roll was no 
 86 place curiosity or entertainment.
 87      The lead van of each set was living quarters, he was later told by the 
 88 carrivan's master, whose name turned out to be Jichaj.  Jichaj joined him on 
 89 the driving bench of the lead set, taaking the controls in his own hands.  The 
 90 lead van of this set was the carrivan's kitchen and Jichaj's own quarters.  Its
 91 two trailers were a kind of store on wheels.  The other leaad vaans were 
 92 devided into bunk space (4 each).  The other trailers held unopened packages of
 93 dry and or perrishable goods.  
 94      Everyone rode up front, Sheji was told, except through the long stretches 
 95 of hazzard where they slept and ate in turns to avoid having to stop.
 96      The road was well mentained, if primitive, and the forrest rolled smoothly
 97 by.  Soon it opened out into farms and fields surrounded by low stone walls.
 98      Ahead loomed the massive portcullus of the village wall, to which the 
 99 road, now oilled and gravelled was leading them.

123      Stretching languidly in the warm  afternoon sun of indian sumer the

135 skills would have been helpful on that voyage  bt the danger was,  shall
136 we say, increasing exponentally. 'Things are not always what they seem.'
137 Obvious in retropect, the nature of reality lay veiled in the great Maya
138 of drem visions.  By the time truth reared its obvious head, the blatant
139 use of good  name and  character to  legitimatize  undercover  markets of
140 exotic agricultural goods  was long past danger and approaching critical.

236 the idea I'm settin a bad example and puttin words in other people.  Ya see,

240 yes there is a chapter two to fallow, of 'new laaands'

242      Above loomed the massive portcullis of the village wall.  To this, the 
243 road, now oiled and graveled brought them.  
244      Here they were stoped and required to pay a toll.  This toll, Sheji later 
245 learned was the town's all but sole source of revinue.  In receipt Juchaj was 
246 handed a merchanter's permit, good for the duration of thair stay, to be 
247 surrendered on leaving.
248      The marquit squre was opposite the end of the town's only other street, at
249 its only intersection. (a three way).  At the other end of this street was the 
250 temple.  On one corner stood a raambling single storried affair which proved to
251 be the village's only inn.  On the third corner and on up tward the temple were
252 the storefront shops of crafters.
253      When the carrivan had been arrayed around the currently empty square, the
254 inn's keeper came out and greeted Jichaj.  Chulan and the rest of the crew 
255 departed for the inn.
256      Sheji was suddenly very conspicously alone.  The innkeeper told him to go
257 inside and get himself something to eat.
258      The inn's main room was filled with a welcome babble of conversation.  
259 Carrivaners and villagers were busily renuing old aqquaintances and catching up
260 on the latest gossip.  Sheji found a small unocupied table neaar one corner and
261 seated himself.
262      No sooner had he slid the horn case under, than a steaming plate and quart
263 sized mug were placed in front of him.  He smiled uncertainly at the bar maid 
264 who had brought them.  She returned a heart melting grin before slipping 
265 quietly away.
266      So far so good he thought as he attacked the main course, some unfamiliar
267 sort of roast beast that tasted as good as it smelled.
268      He was nearly through the meal and fealing mellow when Jichaj and the 
269 innkeeper joined him.
270      "Sholuch" Jichaj spoke, indicating the innkeepper,"has aggreed to take you
271 on.  Room and board and one silver a week, provided you help out as a general 
272 hand and your horn doesn't drive off the paying customers."
273      "I'll be all the stage pressence you'll needd" Sholuch told him.  "You 
274 needn't worry much howw the room will react: Haven't had a bard through here in
275 more than a month.  There's a room out back by the stables where you can 
276 practice to your heart's delight."
277      You can start earning your tab tonight, tommarow if you'd rather.  After 
278 that it starts to add up."
279      "Tonight's fine" Sheji managed not to squeak, "as soon as suppper's had a 
280 chance to settle."
281      He wondered at the innkeeper's choice of phrase but kept his peace.  The 
282 bar girl came back with deserts.  These proved to be chocklet in flavor with a 
283 consistancy somewhere betteween ice cream and moose with crunchey bits blended 
284 in.  Sholuch sliped off as soon  as he was finnished.  Jichaj excused himself s

296 Hi Muse,
297 .
298      The depressing stuff I was referring to was a file that Helix
299 had me download from Agora.  I made the mistake of reading it.  A
300 story about a girl in post-holocaust Oregon isn't one of the more
301 uplifting things to read, and doing so in a dark and silent room is
302 even less so.  Anyway, nothing permanent.  I entered that note just
303 after I finished reading it.  By the way, tell Helix that I'll give
304 the disk to him when you two are down here for Fowl Day.  Looking
305 forward to seeing both of you this weekend.  Take care...

310 Fable master, you wan *depressing*? I've got a song for you to hear next time 
311 you are up here. It's called "Lullaby". It is a mother singing to her son
312 (with frequent interruptions by the son).
313 	Sounds ok, right? Well, mom and a few others were on a "probe ship".
314 It was to accerelate to near light speed and then decelerate to a stop at the
315 target star. Meanwhile they'd be in cold sleep.
316 	When the woke up they discovered that something had gone very wrong
317 they had kept accelerating *and* they had overslept. The ship was at .99...
318 c and a couple centuries out (*ship* time!!).
319 	They kept alive been careful recycling. Meanwhile mom has a kid as they 
320 race for the edge of the universe. Now there's only mom and the kid left....
321 	As she puts it in the song, "late, last child of human kind".
322 	*real* cheerful. (I'm not sure if ma poisoned herself and the kid or not)
323 	The worst part is that you aren't *conciously* getting most of this info
324 they're just talking. But in the back of your mind the pieces start fitting
325 together. Then blammo. Makes "Space is Dark" seem light and lively.

333 I'se back. Or still here, depending on how you see it. Lots of things have been
334 hapenning, some bad, some good, some damned good.
335 I've been thinking about life. The only conclusion I've reached is that if we
336 didn't face adversity on a regular basis we couldn't enjoy the times when 
337 things go smoothly. I'm becoming (have become) an expert at facing adversity.
338 Somehow that scares me. When too many things go wrong, it begins to shake your

378      "Tonight's fine" Sheji managed not to squeak, "as soon as supper's had
379 a chance to settle."
380       The bar girl caame back with deserts.  These proved to be chocklet in 
381 flavor with a consistancy somewhere betteween ice cream and moose with crunchy
382 bits blended in.  Sholuch slipped quietly away as soon as his was finnished.  
383 Jichaj excused himself shortly thereafter.
384      Sheji pulled a model railroad magazene from his horn case and read for a
385 while.  Evening had grown dark when the innkeeper returned and asked if Sheji 
386 were ready.
387      "Shure" he shruged, mustering what little nerve he was able.
388      The raised hearth was surrounded on two and a half sides by a wide bench. 
389 Sholuch appropriated an unoccupied chair and positioned it adventagiosly.  He 
390 then stood upon the hearth ring and the room grew nearly quiet.
391      "As most of you have by now heard, we have a bard with us tonight.  He has
392 traveled far, though in other lands.  He has the praise of fish hunter Thuva.  
393 I've known no finer judge of the bardic art."
394      Taking this as a que, Sheji rose amidst much encouragement and seated 
395 himself as Sholuch had provided.
396      The sudden stilness when he opened the case was like a solid prescence.  
397 when he removed the horn - excited whispers broke out and many leaned forword 
398 for a better look.  Save for pictures in anciant books on dusty shelves of
399 more litterate mechanicians, none had seen its like.
400      Sheji, having no least idea what might best appeal, grabbed the first 
401 thing off the top.  Greensleves it turned out to be, having most recently 
402 played it for Thuva.  This he fallowed with Matty Graves then Joani Mitchel's 
403 clouds.  After that he improvised for a good three quarters of an hour.  After
404 that he needed - and took a break.
405      Sholuch led him to a quiet side room away from his clammering fans, 
406 brought him a steaming mug and told him to forget about the grunt work.
407      Before the night was thoroughly exausted he was called back for five more
408 sets.
409      Reputation and trade had been established beyond doubt.  He was led to a 
410 room that far surpassed anything the inn's outword appearance might have 
411 suggested.  The bed linnen was crisp and clean, the blankets warm and thick,
412 the mattrice was foam.  The floor was carpeted, windows glazed and curtained.  
413 There was a sturdy wooden dresser and a thoroughly unexpected steel desk.  The 
414 room had its own bath, hot water tap, flush commode.
415      Sheji put his horn in the closet, sliped the latch on the door, got un-
416 dressed and into bed.  Making sure the box of matches was where he could find 
417 them, hhe blew out the candle.
418      When next he opened his eyes the room was flooded with the slanting rays 
419 of midmorning sun.

431 **************Cheryl****************************************************
432 Well, folks...you've managed to motivate me toward putting something up
433 here myself.  Justin, you may have seen this one before--I wrote it in
434 9th grade, and I believe that it was still circulating the following
435 year--but I doubt you'd remember it (who would after ten years?).  This
436 should hold me until I get what I'm cooking up now finished (or at least
437 half-baked).
438  
439 He stared at the body lying crumpled on the ground.  It had been his
440 father, but was now a corpse with a large hole in it.  The blood ran
441 freely and red from the stomach and lay in a pool around the battered
442 form.
443  
444 With an oath, the boy turned away and sought refuge among the trees.
445 These woods were his homeland; he knew them better than was possible
446 of anyone save those who were born here.
447 He was hostile and sullen, for it was not his way--nor the way of his
448 people--to show fear or sorrow.  Instead, he wondered about the kind
449 of man who could throw a metal ball so hard from any distance, and
450 what kind of punishment the gods would visit upon one who had
451 stricken down one of their chosen.
452  
453 He didn't know what to do.  He knew that he could not go back to the
454 village.  The others would ask about his father, and he knew he would
455 not be able to lie.  Not believing the truth, they would drive him
456 off--or worse.
457  
458 "Only the gods have the power to do such a thing, and no god would
459 bring a new weapon against the chosen people;" they would say, "you
460 are a prophet of doom.  Be gone!"
461 He felt that the only chioce left was to fend for himself; that way
462 the results would be the same--and he could do without the humiliation
463 and beatings.  His pride was his strength, and both would be gone
464 quickly if he ventured to near home.
465  
466 Taking paths that most men's eyes could not see, he came to a spring he
467 had discovered the year before, while traveling with a friend.  It was
468 near a cobbled road, and often men with fair hair and strange clothing
469 that did not come from any beast would walk by in even rows.
470  
471 The boy wondered why men should go pushing through the forest laying
472 row upon row of stone in their path and marching in file over the broad
473 road they had made.  Were they blind, that they needed such guidance to
474 find their way, and in so large a band?  It was much quicker and far
475 more simple to slip silently through the woods, and attracted fewer
476 unfriendly eyes.
477 He came upon the row of bushes that lined this cobbled road and sat
478 down to watch.  By this time he was very hungry, for his last meal had
479 been dinner the night before.  It was late and he had set no traps for
480 game.  He was desperate.
481  
482 He decided to follow the road--he knew that where there were people,
483 there would be food.  He was not as certain that there would be any
484 for him, however.  They would probably think him a thief or a beggar
485 (and they would be partially right).
486  
487 As he walked down the road, he came upon an enormous shelter built by
488 stacking many logs.  Men came marching up the road toward him.  He
489 thought that this would not be the best way to first meet with them,
490 so he ducked behind the hedge.  To his surprise, many of his own 
491 people were hidden there, too.  He hoped that they would be too busy
492 watching to ask questions about his father right away.
023=Usr:196                   11/26/87 10:36  Msg:830 Call:5424  Lines:13
493  
494 Instead, they asked another question, for none had dared to venture
495 onto the road.
496  
497 "How many are the men with the fair hair?", a man asked.
498 "A large pack, I would say, no more;" the boy answered, "they
499 carry only large sticks that are strangely shaped.  If we stay
500 out of striking range, they will be no match for our spears."
501  
502 At that brave first and last stand for the villagers the boy fell
503 senseless, torn open by a British musketball.

518   "Hopeing having you are a good day and life" said the note, along with 
519 several lines of message in several languages. Evidently the writer's native
520 tongue was not English.
521   I walked along the beach, reading the tattered piece of paper several times
522 and turning it over in my hands. The texture was that of a dead, dried leaf.
523 The green-glass bottle had preserved it well-even the cork was still largely
524 intact and had come out in one piece (with some heavy prying).
525   Folding the paper and slipping it into the pocket of my shirt, I then exam-
526 ined the bottle closely. There were no markings on the sides, but when I looked
527 at the bottom I could see something of an alien language there. It looked Chi-
528 nese for a moment, but then it seemed to be Sanskrit.
529   I'd wished then that I had paid more attention to my language study.
530   Then I had an idea. I felt about on my person and turned up a mechanical 
531 pencil and a scrap of paper. Finding a log I sat down and began to write a 
532 poem. When I was done I could see that-in my opinion anyway-it was not my best
533 work, but then again, I knew I would never read the review. Oh, well.
534   I rolled the paper into a tight cylinder, then slipped it down the neck of
535 the bottle, replacing the cork as snugly as possible. Then, I walked to the 
536 water, taking off my shoes and socks as I went. I walked into the surf, never
537 bothering to roll up my jeans, cocked back my arm as far as it went, then gave
538 the bottle my best and most powerful throw.
539   Gracefully and deliberately it sailed through the air in an arc, splashing
540 into the brine finally as if to assure me that in throwing out the beautiful
541 green glass I had done the right thing. It bobbed once, twice, and then began
542 to float outward as if to defy the tide to reach the  current that beckoned to
543 take it to another distant recipient.
544   I realized then that the bottle was not the gift. The note was. No, the bot-
545 tle was the Messenger, immune to the want that someone may put upon it, commit-
546 ted always to its calling.
547   I wondered who would next receive the courier, and who would read my note. 
548 How many more will capture the bottle?
549   Would it ever come back to me?

561   Another weary evening.  The piper sat watching the dancing sparks of still
562 another small fire leaping into the cool night air.  Taking their inspiration
563 from the burning heat, they launched themselves into the unknown.  Their
564 ascent was rapid, bringing a small light into the darkness, but their life

576 	"Careful with that brazier, apprentice," muttered Grann as he entered
577 the workshop.  An unusually tall gnome boy in a coarse brown robe carefully
578 replaced the brazier to the rack on which it belonged.  "You know that you
579 don't need that for what you're studying.  If you were to use it, you might
580 accidentally summon up a daemon that might devour the town."
581 	"I'm...I'm sorry, master.  It drew me.  The patterns upon it are
582 absorbing.  And the colors!"
583 	"Nonetheless, dangerous.  Pretty things are often the most dangerous
584 of all.  Mark you well how many creatures in nature snare their prey by
585 attractiveness!  Let that be your lesson today.  Put away your book and
586 listen awhile."
587 	Grann took a chair and sat down.  After a moment of thought, he
588 began his story.
589 	"My own master, Milchar, taught me this lesson one day when I was
590 hungry for power over others and fascinated by the tools of the craft.  One
591 day I came upon one of the oldest books of dweomercraft Milchar possessed.
592 It was centuries old, but looked newly bound; the leather cover was sturdy
593 and clean.  The book had metal inlays of a golden metal which protected it
594 from abuse.  It was quadrillium, as I found out later.  If I would have known
595 that from the beginning I would never have opened it."
596 	"What's quadrillium, master?  I have never heard of it."
597 	"Eh?  Oh, yes.  You're not far enough along to know yet.  Quadrillium
598 is a metal that has the remarkable ability to store magical energy for long
599 periods of time.  Millennia, at least.  It also can release it instantaneously.
600 It's perfect for magical traps; few thieves are ignorant of what it can do."
601 	"Was the book trapped, master?"
602 	"No, fortunately for me.  If it had been, I would not be here today.
603 No, the fact that it was inlaid with quadrillium would have warned me about
604 the book had I known, though.  But, being ignorant, I opened the book.
605 My eyes glanced over the page that it had opened to.  In an instant, my eyes
606 were locked upon the spell, and I had no choice but to finish reading it.
607 When I was done, the room was dark.  I could not see the door, the bench,
608 or even the book I held before me.  Silence clamped down upon the room
609 instantly.  I could not hear a thing, not even my own breathing.
610 	Then I could hear something.  Something evil.  It was waiting in the
611 dark for me.  I could sense that it was near, nothing more.  You cannot
612 imagine how frightening it is not to be able to at least SEE what you know
613 is about to rend you to bits."
614 	The boy was literally sitting on the edge of his stool.  "And then?"
615 	"Then it got worse.  More of THEM got in, somehow.  Perhaps the spell
616 had created a doorway to wherever THEY lived, I thought.  I crept toward a
617 corner of the laboratory that held the Nchaser's globes.  THEY closed in,
618 ever closer.  I managed to get a globe, but it didn't work.  One of THEM was
619 very close.  I threw the globe at it- then the light returned."
620 	"Did you hit the creature?"
621 	"No, I missed.  Fortunately.  It was Milchar."
622 	The boy's face held a puzzled expression.  "I don't understand."
623 	"It was the spell.  It was an illusion spell in the book that
624 I read, a trap set for nosy apprentices.  Milchar had been standing there,
625 laughing as I had blindly sought the globes.  What I had thought was an
626 evil creature was merely my master trying to get close enough to remove the
627 enchantment."
628 	"That is hardly fair!  Didn't you get angry at being fooled
629 that way?"
630 	"Yes, but not long.  Milchar told me about the time he had fallen
631 for the same trick when he was an apprentice."
632 	"Why haven't you done the same?  It seems almost a tradition."
633 	Grann grinned.  "Who says I haven't?  It doesn't have to be
634 a book, you know.  Or the same spell."  With that, Grann got up and left.
635 	The boy looked at row after long row of scrolls, charms,
636 amulets, and wands... then sighed.  Slowly he returned to his desk and opened
637 his spell book.  "The flight spell has several components, that being those
638 of the Verbal, those of the Somatic, and those of the Material..."

642      In the shop of Aruleg all was quiet.  He could no more than trade existing
643 shathas till Regnor got down from the hills with another caravan of concen-
644 trates.  So far he'd sold two control cables and a lever box.  The last one,
645 a merchanter named Cherri, had tried to talk him out of a new linkaage.  He had
646 politely directed her down the street to Joli the wheelcrafter.
647      He'd settled back with the latest issue of Rainbow Geographic when his 
648 reverie was shattered by a commotion outside.  Thejag, the apothicarries 
649 apprentice came running in all red faced and out of breath.
650      "Its horrible" he wheezed, not waiting for breath to catch him up.  "They 
651 found Rregnor halfway down the side of Long Ravine, what was left of him.
652 His train is in splinters and he looks like hamburger with bones sticking out.
653      They've got him up at the temple now but I doubt his spirit will want to
654 come back to that.  No telling how long he'd been gone when they found him.
655 They said he was soft when they picked him up but its a known fact that cannion
656 can play tricks, especialy the upper end of it, too close to Elendar territory"
657      "That it is.  Too close for comfort too.  Hasn't been any activity up that
658 way for years.  Just long enough for us to forget thair there.  Not long enough
659 for them to forget about us, never is.  Shure looks like one of thair tricks
660 alright."
661      "I suppose Lijo's gonna want my memories to help with the rebuilding.
662 Might as well head up that way if the whole town hasn't gotten there first."
663      "That's what she sent me down here for.  I'll walk back up."
664      "Wait a micro while I close up.  You can come with me."
665      At the temple they were let through.  Bussiness aside, Aruleg had been
666 one of Regnor's closest friends.
667      Thovu the apothicarry (not to be confussed with Thuva the fish hunter)
668 was in the sickbay tending to the cadaver that had been Regnor.  Lijo was 
669 already in her healing trance, eyes squeezed shut against tears of concen-
670 tration.
671      Aruleg streatched out on one of the other palletts nearby.  He pressed a
672 contact to alert the High Priestess that he was ready.  No sooner had he done
673 so than he felt the nulaj state come over him.  Thovu had told him when he 
674 came in that Vuli and the others had already raised a circle in the inner
675 chaimber.  Appearently she had.
676      Lijo didn't intend to attempt a full resurection.  She knew she had 
677 neither the strength nor craft for that.  The whole idea of a spirit autopsy 
678 was to establish the circumstances prior to death.  For that the memories of
679 a close friend or aquaintance were required as a focus.

683 I'm sitting here looking at Justin's back. He's got a chance to acquire a
684 computer which has no name. It looks vaguely like a TRS-80, but has two disk
685 drives set vertically at the side of the screen. In the manual with it it is
686 referred to only as "the Word Processor" or "the CRT". (A generic?)
687   Justin just said it doesn't even seem to be a computer as far as he can tell.
688 Probably just a word processing terminal. Useful, but still.........

718   **Leonard:thanks for the unsolicited question. There is a plate on the back
719     That proclaims the machine was made by Ontel Corporation. Additionally,
720     the title on the Main Menu screen proudly identifies it as the:
721               S B S  W O R D  P R O C E S S I N G  S Y S T E M
722     The man who wants me to buy it also brought over a Diablo daisy wheel 
723     printer that weighs pretty close to 6000 pounds. It has no "off" switch
724     and makes a continuous high whining noise when power is on. I have not 
725     yet figured out how to make the thing print anything. It claims to have
726     a Direct-Typewriter mode but that things screwy, too. 
727        Also, I notice that perusing through the manual gives no info what-
728     so ever about who made the system. 
729        Additionally, drive 1 ( the top one ) tends to give system errors 
730     when I try to duplicate or initiallize a disk. But as far as that goes,
731     Martin here tells me that its extremely curable. The other problem is
732     probably very solvable(and I just got an inspiration on how).
733        All this guy wants is $50 for the thing. Think I'll scrape it up
734     and make it my own. Its not the toy I've been wanting, but I've gotten
735     wind that I'll be running into one of those too.
736  
737  **Cheryl: Communicate apologies to your brother that Brittania and I didnt
738     make the game. We really wanted to but the Infinite Is thought it would
739     make practical jokes that day. We'll try to make it down there-and of
740     course, across town to see you. I dont believe you've met Brittania
741     (aka Tansy) yet. You'd like her. ***I know I do!***
742  
743      I'll quit taking up board space for personal kah-kah now.

775 GENERAL QUESTION: To anyone else out there who is also on No Name. I have four
776 different phone numbers for No Name, which is good. However, one of them, the
777 first on my list(245-xxxx) never works. It rings and I get the tone, but 
778 nothing ever comes up. The other three numbers work fine (when they're not busy
779 .....), but not this one. I'm going to notify the sysop the next time I can get
780 on, but I would like to know if anyone else has the same problem.

783 OK, it is working again, seems that the problem started on the
784 1st of december. Which is a result of a test in the user list
785 routine which checks to see if the user number is valid by
786 looking at the month "If user.Amonth < 12 then userbad := true;".
787 But since december is the 12th month.....

789 The first line on NoName is 2400 baud *only* now, so you'll have to use
790 one of the other four.  (There are actually 5 public ones now.)
791  
792 Speaking of NoName, what does one have to do to get validated on there?
793 I've been trying for over a month, but nobody ever calls me, and my
794 application seems to be deleted periodically.  My husband, on the other
795 hand, has been validated already.  And I called before he did!

805      lots of neet stuff in the last couple of days.  nice to see the Inn 
806 livening back up.  anyway...
807      Lijo hadn't intended to attempt a full resurection.  She knew she had
808 neither the strength nor craft for that.  The whole idea of a spirit autopsy 
809 was to establish the circumstances prior to death.  Ffor that the memories of 
810 a close friend or associate were required as a focus.
811      An immage came through faided, as if something somewhere were trying to 
812 hold it back.  The need projecting was palpable.  That came through too.
813      Could the Elendar somehow be holding captive Regnor's spirit?
814      The immage that got through, however breafly, was of a great winged rep-
815 tilian, somehow not entirely substantial, flapping in steady pace with Regnor's
816 carrivan as it carefully threaded its way down the winding mountain road.  As 
817 the winged horror grew more opaque and changed to a warmer color, it was as if 
818 some great invisable hand swept slowly up the carrivan's length.  Each wagon 
819 seamed to burst, splinter and practicaly turn inside out.  Suddenly all was
820 red and screaming torment for an instant, then gone.  
821      Nothing.
822      Every attempt to reistablish contact met a fortress like invisable wall.
823      The body of Regnor was gone.  Thovu had seen it fade.  First translucent,
824 then transpearent, then gone.
825      They were all shaken.  Togather they retired to a meditation room for a 
826 soothing.
827                                 *=*=*=*
828      The Elendar have always been, so the legends say.  There are some who say
829 they are as old as the world.  Some say they built the world.  
830      Be that as it may, they were here before the coming of the Gates.  Some 
831 say it is they who built them.  Others not.
832      Thair lot is no longer one of peace.
833      They haunt the wild places and work enchantments to ends unknown.  Where
834 the maps show vast areas, whited out, largely unexplored, where the roads that
835 cross these are lined both sides with little red death's heads, universal 
836 symbol of warning, these lands they hold.
837      It is said the wild hunting beasts have become thair companions.  These 
838 and creatures too hedios to mention.  Some say these are only the wild stories 
839 of those who have known great and inexplicable fear.  Whatever the truith of 
840 the matter, carrivans vanish.  Every season one hears of another or several.  
841 Sometimes without so much as a splinter to mark the spot.

843      Darkthorn would not have considered himself an object of fear, except
