36                  A one-act play on words by A. M. Goer
37 
38      My name is Maxwell, Brian Maxwell, and I am mad.  Some people think I
39   have it easy, and often confuse me with old what'sisface Reilly.  But I
40  have news for them: being a cop in Beverly Hills is no picnic.  Not
41   now, and not 9 years ago, when I first came to this cauldron of the
42   black arts.  Summer of 2001, it was.  I remember it well, as the press
43 was full of stuff about some guy they kept calling 'King Arthur'.
44      Never did find out what that was all about.  There was a young buckaroo
  n
45    Broadway, and there was no room left for him in her life.  He bordered
46  on sheer madness, and almost met his end at a poker game.  I had just
47     gotten the king of hearts I needed to fill a straight, when in came six
48   Samurai.  I asked what had happened to the other one, but before they
49      had a chance to say anything, the buckaroo yelled BONZZZZAAAIIII!! and
50    lit into 'em.  The poor kid didn't even know any karate.  There I was on
51    the jagged edge of a compromising position.  I was undercover, tracking
52  a card sharking gang, and had just figured out the system (hence the
53    straight...), and it was time to nail the ring leader.  I had just
54    spent a year of living dangerously following that bird from out beyond
55  Thunderdome (though that's another story).  If I helped the kid, my cover
56   would be blown to smithereens, and most likely so would I.  We were
57   both saved by some blade runner who had been standing unnoticed in the
58 shadows.  As he retired the fake Samurai, I noticed a strange piece of
59     intricately folded paper in the shadows where the stranger had been
60      standing.  We finished the card game, after which I had enough
61 to put that gang away for some time to come.  It was time to take a
62  vacation and relax -- this cloak & dagger stuff can get to you after a
63      while.  My first wife, Joan, always thought that a trip into the wilder
  p
64    river, I just didn't see the romance in it.  Europe should be nice this
65   time of year though...

100 "Nick Young, Private Eye"
101 Part One: Death at the Diner
102 
103       Inside the diner, Private Detective Nick Young was ordering his 
104 dinner.
105       "The usual," he told the waitress,"and on toast."  The waitress 
106 looked sick and shuffled away.
107       A man came into the diner, out of the biting Chicago winds.  He
108 was wearing a heavy overcoat, and he was shivering.  Looking around 
109 the diner nervously, he spotted Nick at joined him in the booth.
110       "Nick," the man started,"I need your help, someone's been 
111 following me!"
112       Nick started picking his teeth with a match he kept just for that
113 purpose.  "Yea?" he drawled (he had been practicing his drawl lately,
114 and was eager to try it out), "So what?  In Chicago, half the people
115 follow the other half all the time."
116       The man across from him looked puzzled.  "Nick, they want to kill
117 me!"
118       Nick waited for some dramatic music.  Finding none, he started to 
119 say, "Okay Jerry, here's what cha' do..."
120       But before he could finish, two large men burst into the diner, each
121 carrying an SMG.
122       Jerry tried to pass through the material of the booth bench, but
123 the bond of the polychemicals used to make it was to close.  He reached
124 into his coat and pulled out a snub-nosed .38.
125       Leaping up, he pointed the gun towards the two men.  The gangsters
126 opened fire and Jerry took four slugs from each gun before he sank to the
127 floor, dead.
128       The gangsters moved over to the booth and kicked Jerry's body to
129 make sure that he was dead.  Seeing that he was, one of them pulled out a 
130 business card and handed it to Nick.  The card read "ACME INSURANCE".  
131 They left the diner without a word.
132       Nick got up and slung Jerry's corpse over his shoulder.  On his
133 way out, the waitress said,"What cha' gonna do Nick?"
134       Nick turned and said levelly, "Never eat here again, that's for
135 sure!"

146    After half an hour the lights had faded behind them. They continued walking until finally Tariya wanted to know,
147 "Where are we going? Where's your transport?"
148    "Where's yours?"
149    "Uh, floating in hyperspace somwhere between here and the Andromeda nebula."
150    James grinned, "That sounds like quite a story."
151    "I forgot to lock down the dimensional stabilizer and when I came back it was gone." she admitted.
152    "Right." James reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver card. "Fortunately, I don't have to worry about
153 things like that. I carry my transportation with me."
154    She looked at the card doubtfully. "It looks a little small for the both of us."
155    "But looks can be deceiving. Watch." He placed his thumb meaningfully on the center of the card. Tariya watched
156 expectedly but nothing happened. Finally James coughed embarassedly. "Oops. Wrong side. Now watch."
157    He turned over the card and pressed his thumb on it again. A glowing red rectangle immediately appeared beneath it.
158 The a dim white aura surrounded the small card. "Now we're cookin'." he said as he placed it on the ground.
159    Seconds after they stepped back the card changed shape. Now it was a circle. Suddenly the circle exploded outwards
160 to a diameter of four feet. Tariya gasped a little and jumped back. James laughed. Having reached its maximum
161 horizontal size, the circle began to expand vertically. It grew upwards until they were confronted with a seven foot
162 tall cylinder.
163    It stood passively until James reached out and touched a spot on its surface. A split ran down the front and
164 widened as the two front quarters rotated back into the back half. Now there was just half a cylinder, hollow inside.
165 On the back inside was a 3X4 grid of small glowing red spots. Tariya gasped, "That's incredible!"
166    "It's a technique called hyperfolding. Uses interdimensional geometry that gives me a headache just thinking about
167 it. It basically forces the volume back in on itself until you get the size you want. Just don't ask me what happens
168 to the mass." he was like a kid showing off a new toy.
169    "I'm impressed. But it still looks a little close in there."
170    "Well, what's wrong with a little closeness?" He wanted to know. The look she gave him answered that question right
171 off. "Okay, okay. There's still more to it. But you have to get inside with me. I'm the only one it obeys. Unless, of
172 course, you don't trust me."
173    "So far I've had little reason to trust you." She pointed at the waiting cylinder, "But at least tell me what that
174 thing is."
175    "Okay." He sighed. After a moment's thought, he said, "Tell me, have you ever heard of a vehicle called a
176 TARDIS?"

206 and yet another attempt at being verbose...
207 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
208   let me see, where shall i begin?  it is somewhat difficult.
209 i see no strife here, yet there is so much not seen by the
210 naked eye.  how long has it been since i died?  a simple quest-
211 ion, yes.  a simple answer?  never!  so many times have i died
212 in my heart that the asking would surely set me to tears.  this
213 time no tears are dropped, hopefully.
214   "since i have died?" i ask cheerfully to cover the scars
215 hidden in my heart.  "why, i haven't died yet.  and i hope not
216 to die for a long, long time.  why should you ask such a ques-
217 tion?  are you in such fear of being near your own?"
218   "no, i don't fear that which is the past.  i had only
219 wondered if i might be in the company of my people once again."
220 zeb turned her head slightly and breathed a sigh noticed only
221 in the rise and fall of the blankets covering her delicate
222 frame.  "perhaps it is only a dream that i may return to where
223 i came."
224   "the past?  hmm, what has happened to bring you here then, or
225 us for that matter?"  one can only say so much before my
226 interest is perked.
227   "if only i could tell you.  the words escape me..."  her
228 words trailed as her ability to communicate verbally became
229 subdued by her frustration.  yet in that frustration i began to
230 see images in my mind that told their own stories.  more vivid
231 were the images of the ones i knew, of the surface of the great
232 black plane.  images of my new-found companions, of piper and
233 this zeb became crystal clear.  feelings and thoughts, slowly
234 these things seeped into my consciousness.
235   "lie quietly," i said to help calm her appartent discomfort.
236 gently i placed my hand on her head as would a mother to her
237 child in understanding.  i smoothed her tossled hair with my
238 fingers.
239   suddenly the images reappeared in my mind, this time more
240 strikingly real.  the feelings, the actual experiences becam my
241 own feelings, my own experiences.  i shuddered under the
242 strength of this onrush.
243   "you are thinking of what has happened on the surface that
244 once was outside the pell-mell.  these... these things, did
245 they really happen?"
246   eyes that had recently closed opened again to look back at
247 me.  "yes, but how do you know?"
248   "i can see them, i can see what is in your mind.  at least, i
249 think i do."
250   "then maybe now i might be able to tell some of these things
251 that are lost with words."  thoughts that were once hers,
252 bits and pieces she had acquired now began to flow to me.  i
253 could not perceive all that came my way, yet some of it seemed
254 so simple.  why hadn't we considered some of this for our-
255 selves?  returning to our home, back near the inn seemed so
256 simple.  yet appearances may often be deceiving.  i was in link
257 with a being i knew very little about other than she looked
258 somewhat like me, only just another girl...
259 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
260 "zeb":  i hope that wasn't too much to swallow for one sitting.
261         just be so kind as to tell me some of the things i'm
262         supposed to know now.  i won't concede to a stalemate
263         with this story.
264 now off to find an old friend to maybe create a twist...

267 Jesus Christ and Moses were golfing one day, and they came upon the
268 7th tee; par 3. Moses led off with a beauty of a shot with his six
269 iron, landed just a few feet from the pin. So Jesus calmly strode up,
270 whipped out his nine iron, and began to line up the shot, whereupon
271 Moses said,  "I'd use a six iron if I were you Lord, it's a bit far
272 for a niner." 
273 
274 Jesus replied,  "No,  I saw Arnold Palmer sink one once from this very
275 same hole, using a nine iron."
276 Moses shrugged and Jesus let loose. The ball drifted to the left and
277 landed smack dab in the middle of the pond. Say "Me Damn" he walked 
278 *oops* Moses giggled and said "see, I told you, whereupon he walked 
279 out toward the water, parted it, and retrieved the ball. "Now, use 
280 your six iron like I did."
281 Jesus took the ball and teed up. "No, if Arnold Palmer can do it, I 
282 certainly can." He took another shot, and again it landed in the 
283 water. He then threw down his club and walked out over the water, and
284 stood staring down at his ball below.
285 At that time the groundskeeper walked up to Moses, staring at the man
286 standing out in the middle of the pond. "Who does that guy think he
287 is?" he asked. "Jesus Christ??"
288 Moses shook his head. "Nope," he said sadly. "Arnold Palmer."

333 
334      I step out of the cold, dark night into the warm sanctity of the bus...
335 It is the number 20, heading into Portland, and this is the beginning of the
336 line... Loosening my trenchcoat, I take a seat 2 forward of the back door...
337 I can have my pick of seats, as there are very few other travellers this far
338 out at this late hour...
339      With my books laid down on the seat next to me, the other 3 or 4 occupants
340 of the bus and myself wait for the driver to return: He is probably drinking a
341 hot cup of coffee or coacoa from one of the many vending machines on campus...
342      I look around me at the other people in the bus; one of them I know by
343 name, he is Mike... I know him only as the system manager of a hole-in-the-wall
344 little company that managed to scrape enough together to buy a Xenix box for
345 whatever it is that they do... He is taking the same class at the college as I
346 am.  I can't help but wonder who he really is... My eyes say that he is about
347 30, and a bit pudgy...                      
348      But it is that which I cannot see that I wonder about: Who is he?
349 Does ha have kids? Does he live alone? Is he gay? It doesn't really matter,
350 I will probably never see him again after the term ends, such is the way with  
351 Night courses at a community college... So many unanswered questions, the
352 answers to which will become less and less important as time goes by... 
353      Once again looking around the bus, my eyes fall on a stunningly beautiful
354 young woman, her dark hair cut shoulder length and slightly puffed on the 
355 sides... She is wearing a gray jacket and Levi's which are much more than 
356 flattering on her... Her beauty comes in a way that is not sexual, but more in
357 the sense that it is plainly obvious that it is indeed a beautiful being 
358 inhabiting that body... She is plainly tired as she looks around the bus with
359 big brown eyes, starts toward the back of the bus, then turns around and plops
360 in the forward side-seats, resting her entire frame on the vow of upholstery, 
361 right under the "PLEASE RESEVVE THESE SEATS FOR ELDERLY OR HANDICAPPED RIDERS"
362 sign... Once again, I can't help but wondering...
363      In my minds eye, I can see the events of earlier that evening:
364 I can see her(Her name is Jennifer) walking away from a house, in the dark, 
365 toward the college... She is crying...
366      "Just who does he think he is?!?!?" She is thinking, in response to the
367 argument that had just taken place... She tries to no avail to fight back the
368 tears as she walks alone through the darkness...  He had given her a good slap
369 to the cheek, and it stung even now as she thought about the way things had
370 escalated from a small disagreement over something so trivial it had already
371 faded from memory, to an all out confrontation in his kitchen...   
372      In a sudden state of reflection and contemplation, she realized how 
373 grossly massochistic people were, How it hurt so bad to love someone, but how
374 it was so sought after and irresistable... The lyrics to an old Billy Joel 
375 song drifted across her mind: "Well we all fall in love, but we disregard the
376 danger"... How fitting song lyrics tended to fe at times, particularly when in
377 a state like this... She was comingup on the college now, and reached into her
378 pocket to dig out enough change to take the bus at least as far as downtown...
379 After a bit of struggling to find the last dime, and finally finding one on 
380 the ground, she breathed a sigh of relief: She really didn't want to have to
381 hitchhike, particularly this late at night, and who knows what kinds of weirdos
382 inhabit Troutdale...
383      The fus was a bit late to leave, but that didn't matter... It would take 
384 her quite a while to recouperate from the shock of the evening, and she didn't
385 think things would ever work out again between her and Brad, he had used her
386 one too many times... But it's not that easy... But she would survive....
387 
388      The bus driver arrived and fired up the engine... The usual routine of 
389 shutting all the doors and putting the big vehicle in gear, and we disappeared
390 into the night, becoming one with the darkness...

397 I stood and gazed about the beautiful territory surrounding the Inn.  The
398 Doctor stepped out of the TARDIS, almost forgetting to let Grann out before
399 locking the outer door.  We had materialized about a quarter mile away from
400 the Inn- we decided a walk would be to our liking.
401 In other places, autumn can seem so depressing.  The gay colors of the leaves
402 which seemed so cheerful here signaled a season of death elsewhere.  Perhaps
403 that is just my biased view.
404 We enjoyed the walk to the doors on the Inn.  The Rowan tree we passed slowly,
405 in recognition of the planting Pam had done herself long before any of us had
406 discovered this pool of creative humanity (er, sorry Zephyr, in this case I'll
407 regard you as human.  That goes for the Tin Man and anyone else I've forgotten,
408 too.).  Just before we reached the threshold, we stopped.
409 Grann looked sad.  "Master, I wish to leave your teaching."
410 I stared at him.  This was not altogehter unexpected, butit still hurt.
411 "I am sorry to see you go, Grann.  Will you return?"
412 "As soon as the Games are over, master.  I find I enjoy your company.  And
413 the Doctor's."
414 "Go, then, with my blessing.  Tell me the outcome when you return!"
415 Grann smiled, and said, "I shall!"  He ran back across the footbridge.
416 He seemed to grow misty as he ran on, finally becoming invisible altogether.
417 The last sign of him was a delayed echo:
418 "I shall!"
419 A tear rolled down my cheek, unbidden.  I wiped it away quickly, cursing such
420 sentimental foolishness.  "After you, Doctor," I said thickly.
421 He opened the door and strode inside; I followed.  The ever-present fire was
422 burning brightly, around which were clustered familiar faces.  For a while,
423 my sadness was masked by my happiness of returning to the place that will
424 always be more home than home.

441      THE YEAR IS 1875 AND CAPTAIN STEVEN B.NIVEK IS 
442 EXPLORING THE PLAINS AND FRONTIER OF GORTANIA.ALONG WITH HIS
443 PARTY OF 35,THE CAPTAIN FINDS AN IDEAL PLACE FOR A TOWN TO 
444 SPROUT UP.
445      UNFORTUNATLY THE SETTLEMENT DOES NOT WORK OUT.A RAGE OF
446 SMALL POX FLOODS THROUGH THE CITY.ONLY THE CAPTAIN AND 7 
447 OTHERS CAN ESCAPE THE FURY.
448      DUE TO HIS FIRST UNSUCESSFULL ATEMPT TO EXPLORE THE 
449 WILDERNESS OF GORTIANA,THE CAPTAIN AND THE SURVIVORS GO BACK
450 TO THE STARTING PLACE OF THIER EXPEDITION.
451      WITH FRESH NEW MEN,HORSES,AND FOOD THE CAPTAIN TRIES 
452 AGAIN.THE EXPEDITION STARTS THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE EXCEPT 
453 THIS TIME THERE IS 12 MORE MEN.
454      AFTER HIKING FOR MORE THAN A WEEK WITH PLENTY OF 
455 STOPS,THE WHOLE SHABANG STOPS AND SETS UP A CAMP FOR THE 
456 KNIGHT.AFTER THE CAPTAIN BUILDS A FIRE,THE WHOLE CREW STARTS
457 TO ROAST THE VENISON THEY HAD CAUGHT EARLIER TODAY.
458      "THAT WAS MY PIECE THAT YOU TOOK YOU RAT!!"SAID THE 
459 FIRST MATE FRANK WELLINGER TO A SCOUT ANGRILLY.
460      "YOUR A GOSH AWFULL FILTHY LIAR,THATS JOE LOTER'S 
461 PIECE,HE DOESN'T LIKE IT SO HE GAVE IT TO ME!"
462      AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,WITHOUT WARNING THE BIGGEST 
463 BRAWL YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN IN YOUR LIFE STARTED.
464      "CRASH!!! BANG BOOM BAMB CRRUNCH OWWWWW!!!!"
465      THOSE WERE JUST A COUPLE OF THE SOUNDS THAT WOKE UP 
466 LT.JIM PORTY AND CAPTAIN NIVEK.
467      "BRAKE IT UP,BRAKE IT UP."THE TWO YELLED IN UNISON 
468 "WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON HERE,I BET THE PEOPLE IN OUR 
469 HOME TOWN COULD HEARD YA,YOU GUYS WERE SO LOUD!!!
470      "WELL YOU SEE SIR,IT REALLY WASN'T ANITHIN JUST A 
471 LITTLE HOME TOWN BRAWL."FRANK WELLINGER TRIED TO EXPLAIN.
472      "I DON'T CARE WHAT IT WAS BUT FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK 
473 YOU TWO,"CAPTAIN NIVEK SAID WHILE POINTING TO FRANK AND AND 
474 SCOUT HAMMOND ,"ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE KP."AND AS THE 
475 CAPTAIN WAS LEAVING TO GO BACK TO SLEEP HE SAID IN A LOW 
476 GROWL,"NOW DON'T YOU GUYS BY GETTING INTO ANY MORE BRAWLS 
477 BECAUSE I HAVE ALOT WORSE THINGS IN MY MIND FOR BRAWLERS 
478 THEN JUST KP."
479      THE NEXT MORNING WAS BRIGHT AND CHEERFULL.YOU COULD 
480 TELL THIS BY ALL THE HAPPY SMILES ON EVERYBODYS FACE,EXCEPT 
481 OF COURSE FOR FRANK AND SCOUT HAMMOND,WHO WERE OBVIUSLY MAD 
482 AT EACH OTHER AND THE CAPTAIN.
483      THE DAYS WENT BY,JUST ABOUT THE SAME EACH DAY EXCEPT 
484 THE FARTHER THEY GOT ON THIER JOURNEY THE FARTHER THEY 
485 TRAVELED EACH DAY.
486      "ALWAYS THE SAME EVERY SINGLE DAY,WAKE UP WITH SUN AND 
487 GET YOUR PAY,TRAVELL ALL DAY,EATING ALONG THE WAY STOPING AT
488 NIGHT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEN ON OUR WAY THE VERY NEXT 
489 DAY."THIS WAS JUST ON OF THE MANY SONGS THAT THE PARTY WOULD
490 SING WHILE HIKING,BOATING OR WHENEVER THEY NEEDED A LIFT.
491      AS THE PARTY KNEW FROM RECENT EXPEDITIONS THEY WERE 
492 ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GORTAINA HIGHLANDS.WITH ONLY 25 
493 MEN AND 9 WOMEN LEFT A WATER BOY AND A YOUNG GIRL HAD A BABY
494 BOY.THEY DECIDED TO NAME HIM AFTER THE WATER BOY'S GRAND 
495 FATHER PETER MOCKONI,SO PETER IT WAS.LUCKILY THE MAN 
496 NAMED,SAMUAL FRANKLIN HAD USED TO BY A MINISTER.SO AS THE 
497 TIMES WOULD OF HAD IT SAMUAL BATIZED PETER.
498      TODAY IT IS SUNDAY AND EVERY BODY RESTS.THE YOUNG 
499 BOYS,PLAYING WITH THIER PLAY GUNS PRETENDING TO BE COWBOYS 
500 AND INDIANS.THIER FATHERS,JUST SITTING IN THE SUN LIKE LAZY 
501 PIGS.THE WOMEN WOULD BE AT WORK SETTING UP THE SUNDAY 
502 FEAST.AND WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON THE TEENAGEERS WOULD 
503 BORROW THIER FATHER'S GUN AND GO GET THAT NIGHTS MEAL.
504      AFTER LEAVING IN MID MORNING THE BOYS WOULD USALLY 
505 RETURN WITH AT LEAST 3 OR 4 RABBITS,USALLY A DEER,AND ONE 
506 SUNDAY THEY EVEN BROUGHT HOME A 150 POUND BALCK BEAR.
507      THE NIGHT WAS ON OF DANCING,LAUGHING,AND EATING WITH 
508 OUT ONE WORRY AT ALL.NOT TO SAY THAT EVERY NIGHT WAS LIKE 
509 THIS BECAUSE ON EVERY OTHER DAY IT WOULD BE WORK,WORK AND 
510 MORE WORK,ALWAYS GETTING READY FOR THE NEXT DAY.
511      AFTER ABOUT 1 MORE WEEK,THE PARTY WAS SUPRISED BUT ALSO
512 ASTONISHED.BEFORE THEM IN A SMALL VALLY WAS A INDIAN 
513 VILLAGE.AT THAT TIME ALL THAT THE INDIANS HAD,AMONG THESE 
514 PEOPLE,WAS AN ALL AROND BAD REPUTATION.THE CAPTAIN HAD SET 
515 UP A STRATAGY.HE KNEW THAT THEY OUT NUMBERED HIM AND HIS 
516 PARTY AT LEAST 3 TO 1.WHAT HE HAD PLANNED TO DO HE TOLD HIS 
517 COLEAGUES.
518      "NOW LISTEN CLOSLY,"THE CAPTAIN SAID QUIETLY,"WE WILL 
519 SNEAK AROUND ON OUR BELLIES UNTIL WE COME TO THAT CLUMP OF 
520 TREES,"HE SAID POINTING TO A SMALL AREA OF CEADER 
521 TREES,"WHILE KEPPING ONE EYE ON THE INDIANS,MAKE A DASH FOR 
522 THAT HUGE BOULER ON THE FAR SIDE OF THAT PLATEAU.WE WILL ALL
523 GO IN PAIRS AND I WILL CARRY BABY PETER.IF THE INDIANS SPOT 
524 ONE OF US AND MAKE SOME REMARK ABOUT IT TO ANOTHER IT'S 
525 EVERY BODY FOR HIM OR HER SELF.IF IN CASE THID DOES HAPPEN 
526 WE WILL ASEMBLE AGAIN TOMORROW AT DAWN RIGHT HERE.SINCE 
527 THERE ARE STILL PRETTY MANY OF US AFTER THERE ARE MORE THAN 
528 3 PAIRS BEHIND THE BOULDER THE FIRST TWO WILL RUN DOWN THE 
529 HILL AND ASEMBLE THERE.FRANK YOU GO FIRST WITH YOUR PARTNER 
530 AND I WILL GO LAST WITH MINE.GOOD LUCK EVERY BODY AND ABOVE 
531 ALL BE SILENT."
532      EVERYTHNG WAS GOING PERFECT UNTILL ON SCOUT SLIPPED AND
533 SOME ROCKS TUMBLED DOWN INTO THE INDIANS VILLAGE.EVERYBODY 
534 HELD THERE BREATH,THE SCOUT LAY STILL,LUCKILLY NOTHING 
535 STIRRED IN THE VILLIGE BELOW.THEY HAD ALL MADE ACROSS THE 
536 MOST CHALLENGING WALL THAT THEY WOULD FACE ON THIER LONG 
537 JOURNEY.
538      AFTER THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE INDIANS EVERYBODY WAS A 
539 LITTLE LESS LIVELY AND ALOT MORE ALERT.
540      IN 5 DAYS TIME THIER JOURNEY HAD ENDED.CAPTAIN NIVEK 
541 AND HIS PARTY HAD FOUND THE PERFECT SPOT FOR A SETTLE 
542 MENT.IT WAS ABSOLUTLY PEFECT A RIVER FLOWING ON THE SOUTH 
543 SIDE A SMALL ROW OF HILLS ABOUT 800 FEET UP ON THE NE 
544 SIDE,AND ABOUT 25 MILES TO THE WEST WAS THE RUTONICAS 
545 OCEAN.THE CAPTAIN AND HIS PARTY RAN TO HIS SPOT.
546      AS TIME WORE ON,THE YEAR NOW 1890 CAPTAIN STEVEN 
547 B.NIVEK PROCLAIMED THIS HIS TOWN.IT WOULD BE CALLED 
548 NIVEKTON.SINCE THERE WAS A SMALL DEPOSIT OF CLAY UNDERNEATH 
549 THE SURFACE A ONE TIME SCULTIST MADE THE NOW FAMOUS 
550 STATUE,OF MR.STEVEN B.NIVEK.
551      THAT VETY STATUE STILL STANDS IN THE SQUARE ON THE 
552 WESTERN SIDE OF NIVEKTON.THOUGH A LITTLE CORODED AWAY BY THE
553 WEATHER THE STATUE STILL RESEMBLES THE FAMOUS FOUNDER OF 
554 NIVEKTON.

557 Kevin B., you just used up God-only-knows how many lines
558 with a story that belongs in a history book. I know you're
559 trying, and to each their own talent, but take more time,
560 and make the thing shorter, and people will enjoy it more.
561 In other words (and I want to be positive, I'm not condemnin
562 g your work, lets keep the quality a little higher here... 
563 and if you realize you're a little lacking, then keep it 
564 short so we can help you with your style, etc.
565 Whew... that blows my time away for my story today folks....

591      With all the commotion that had been stirring within the Pell-Mell, I had
592 decided to leave the little room which I had taken as my one small place of
593 refuge against this insanity.  There was a cry, and then the scuffling of feet
594 outside my room.  I heard concerned voices and now would be a time for me to
595 be of some use on this odd get-together.  I sprang to my feet and was through
596 the proto-door in an instant.
597      "Hey, I just heard someone cry out.  What gives?  Something wrong?"
598      "That is what we'd like to know," said Emu as he slowed for a moment to
599 turn and answer my query.
600      "We think it came from the compartment in the back that may have Lady
601 Tayree and Zeb," added Cragmore over his shoulder.  "If so, I fear terrible
602 things could have happened if she's done anything rash since she made that bit
603 of an outburst."
604      "What do you mean?" I asked.
605      "She's in a delicate stage in her mental development right now.  She's
606 come to learn that she has some hidden abilities locked up inside her head,
607 but if she decides to attempt anything without even the simplest of guidance
608 she may face dire consequences if she would make the slightest mistake in any
609 experimentation."
610      "Wow, that sounds really dangerous."
611      "It is, 'Fechter'."  It was Emu again.  "Under the supervision of my
612 mentor, I was warned against any such gambling.  I've seen a friend of mine
613 take such a risk and end up a vegetable after getting lost in the endless maze
614 that is hidden in everyones mind."  He paused for a moment and then brought us
615 back to the point at hand.  "But for now, we must find the reason for that cry
616 we heard..."
617      "You know, for such a small vehicle, this certainly has a vast expanse of
618 hallway to traverse in order to reach the end," I said.  At least my dog
619 wasn't underfoot right now.
620      "Yes, I've been meaning to mention that," added Bard from the back of the
621 group.  "It sure reminds me *alot* of another 'small' vehicle I know."
622      "Come on, let's get hopping!" blurted Cragmore in a distressed tone.  "We
623 shall have all the time to chit-chat once we're at the bottom of this."
624      "We're right behind you Cragmore," I finished as we made our way down the
625 passage.
