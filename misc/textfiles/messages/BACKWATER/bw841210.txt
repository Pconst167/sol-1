44      The forest is so still this time of year, only the sounds of the wind
45 playing in the branches and the occasional fall of rain intrude to break
46 the silence that shrouds the deep greens and browns of nature in repose.
47 Faint murmurings of the stream that winds near the Inn, now swollen with
48 winter's damp gift, can sometimes be heard.  Even at this distance, its
49 grumbling penetrates my thoughts and causes me to return to the world
50 outside my self.  The approach of the winter solstice and the dawning of
51 the year's most difficult time tends to command the thoughts and strivings
52 of humanity, even in the most technological of worlds, and now my own
53 spirit is filled with longings and wants that will never be attained.  Such
54 is the nature of winter, and such is the nature of the soul.
55  
56      Falling back into the piled leaves and debris, I think that perhaps
57 I've been born to the wrong era, or maybe the wrong species.  I feel so
58 much more attuned to the world and myself here, almost as if I were truly a
59 part of things and not merely an observer of events beyond my grasp or
60 control.  Could it have been some terrible mistake or grand joke that has
61 placed me amoung humanity?  Was the template from which my soul was cast
62 designed for woodland creatures, or trees themselves, and not intended to
63 form the basis of a woman?
64  
65      The answer is simple of course.  I am deeply connected to the world in
66 which I stand, and I draw both power and serenity from it.  But as a
67 product of the industrial world, a child of technology, I have become
68 estranged from nature.  Though still tied to her by an umbilical of
69 dependance, I fight and strive in that different reality, and draw
70 sustenance from her through that tenuous cord.  But at times I must return
71 and establish anew for myself that I am a part of her, a tiny reflection of
72 her grand whole, and refresh myself in the waters of her power.
73  
74      I arise, refreshed and filled with vigor, and think of friends of
75 today and yesterday.  A smile passes my lips at the memory of Dr.
76 Frankenstupe's delight with his new jacket.  Yes, jewelry does become him.
77 I only wish that the stones could have been precious instead of costume,
78 but I suspect that it doesn't matter in the least.  The smile falters a bit
79 as I remember that not long ago our good Innkeeper was on the verge of
80 closing his doors for good, and how I exploded in uncharacteristic anger at
81 those who brought such sorrow to him.  Such is life that even those who try
82 to make the peace sometimes fall prey to their emotions.  I can only hope
83 that my outburst has been forgiven now that Innisfall has returned to its
84 normal state (however "normal" may be defined!).
85  
86      The walk from here to the Inn is long, but the brisk morning air and
87 the cleansing it brings will certainly speed my pace.  Ah, winter is
88 nearby, and I happily await it.

93   FHawthorne; The Designed
94   I feel a little weak from my fainting spell earlier this morning, but seem to be healthy again. I almost passed out three
95 times downtown today, which made for an exhilerating voyage to school.
96   When I got there, for some reason the Staff was reluctsant to send me to the infirmary remarking about what they hated about
97 teenagers today...
98 
99   Man in Gray; The Lady S tells me you dropped by her place today, with a freind, and a very curious disposition. Sorry I left
100 school so early, but I was not feeling very well at all.
101   About introducing Retch to The Lady though, I regret to tell you that she was not overly fond of him, and did not find an
102 extreme ammount of joy in his attentions. If, she says, If she meets up with him again, she claims to want to scream in his
103 ears. And we both know what a tragic fate that would be for anyone, considering her special talent at screaming.
104 
105   Sondargaard; Retreived the Papers yet? I seem to have made a mistake by telling you they would be informative, actually they
106 are only a stepping stone to the all important information.
107 
108   Kathy; No word on the Pente game? Well, I will allow myself a few more days to wait for a reply. After that, I am afraid my
109 hopes will have been dashed.

113   Omega grasped the the cold brass doorknob and twisted it slowly. Exercising his grip subconsciously, for all his training at
114 all arts of deception, this place scared him, and fright for no reason was unlike Omega.
115   At least he thought there was no reason. An old arcane store, stocked with devices of witchcraft and every so often, a thing
116 of demonology. Scaring only to those who beleive in it thought Omega. No reality in any of it.
117   This last turn of thought worried Omega. Omega was here for a reason which required reality in at least the powers of the
118 owner. He needed someone who could explain to him where he was and how he got there. He also needed someone to get him back.
119 
120   Omega needed to return to his own Earth. His own turn of events, his own reality.
121 
122   Omega stepped inside from the cold. Warming his hands in his own breath he shiffed in the deep and tranquilizing smells of
123 this place, and what a place...

128 Ah, yes, winter comes, in a final furious battle as Summer
129 strives to maintain its ever ebbing hold on the season, the
130 transition called Fall. The plants shed their summer clothes
131 and turn inward to ready themselves for the harsh winter cold.
132 The bright green sunny world has changed to a stark cold
133 framework of skeletons and bare walls. Thoughts turn inward
134 to self and being. An analysis of the summers activities,
135 their value to the world at large, friends, and the individual
136 self. Does it come lacking, or has it been positive on the 
137 whole? What could have been changed to make it better? What
138 can be done in the future to improve the activities and 
139 thoughts? Yet even as there is a turning inward, a healing
140 of wounds, a rebuilding of strength, a preperation to do
141 battle where one must, and toil side by side where possible,
142 still there is the bud deep down inside building and growing
143 waiting for spring to once more blossom forth and strive yet
144 again to grow towards the warm inviting sun. To do great deeds
145 improve the world where one can, and defend its virtue where
146 one cannot. But, now is the time of reflection, time to discard
147 old values and worn out concepts as a tree sheds it leaves
148 when it is finished with them. A time to ready oneself to
149 build anew. These thoughts come as I sit staring at my
150 fireplace, ever burning non-burning logs. Desires and hopes
151 unfullfilled filter through my thoughts. Actions and activities
152 of the past year mix with these thoughts as well. On the whole
153 the year has been good, yet always there is striving to yet
154 greater achivement. The fullfillment of goals and desires not
155 met, and new goals created to be achieved. Always in the
156 background sits the thought, if only things would work out, only
157 a little change everything would be alright, yet even when things
158 do follow your desired path, there is always a new path to see
159 and desires to follow. Yet the hopes, the dreams, the desires for
160 comfort with the world and oneself continue to prevade...

180      Reclined on a leaf-wreathed log, brow thoughtful, eyes brimming
181 with warm regard for the forest's gift of serenity, Pam parted her
182 lips for sweet song, never guessing that eyes looked on wonderingly.
183 A beautiful song, indeed:  sometimes intoned solemnly, then rewoven 
184 into trills and warbles of appreciation; but always soft, the mist
185 from her breath swirling with grace out into the peaceful, listening
186 woods...Finally she shook her hair out and stood, the rustle of her
187 skirts alerting the small figure whose eyes had closed the better to
188 hear her lilting song.  When Pam's step turned towards the Inn's path,
189 however, knowing she could not follow, the little cat sprang out to
190 intercept her.  Her eyes were a radiant golden, her tail a bouyant
191 banner, and her purr a delicious medley of delight, welcome and
192 invitation to continue...And when Pam continued, the cat curled her
193 tail around her paws, and gazed longingly down the road she'd taken.

220      "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of 
221 the day..." Rosewood hummed to himself as he finished 
222 puting away the remnants of his last section to the 
223 days assignment. He hadn't been able to read the morning
224 paper, so he didn't know if he was going to get off the 
225 hook until another day or not. Was that kid actually
226 considering doing something so rash as to warrant it
227 getting the attention he was looking for? Rosewood was
228 breaking into a cold sweat just looking at his empty
229 terminal imagining all the sreens and screens of explaining he
230 would get himself into if the kid actually received
231 the local acclaim he mumbled about.    Just as visions
232 of mindless intrigue were beginning to form in his mind
233 Taggart walked over to his desk while puting on his jacket,
234 and said,   "Come on, Billy, let's get something to eat."
235 Rosewood, comeing out of his trance, just looked up to
236 him with his usaul blank expession and said    "Huh?"
237 "I said  let's get something to eat. I'm starving, so hurry
238 up, will you? The Chief wants to see us back at HQ by 13:00,
239 and I don't intend on seeing him on an empty stomache."
240 Now Rosewood was really sweating.  "The Ch-Ch-Chief wants
241 t-t-to see us?  What happened?"      "Don't you listen to
242 anyone anymore?  The Chief told us he wanted to see us 
243 about looking into that missing agent, Omega 6 I believe..."
244 Rosewood collapsed with relief in his chair. "Oh, just that."
245 "JUST THAT? This could be really important! Why, what did 
246 you think he wanted to see us for?"     "Oh, nothing major,
247 I just thought something else was going to happen..."
248 "Like what? Getting a raise?  Come on, let's get something
249 to eat before you really make me lose my apetite."
250 Rosewood just gave him a grin and then put his papers away.
251 Yes, he was off the hook for today, but that kid could be
252 a virtual timebomb if he had any brains.     As he locked
253 his desk, he said,    "O.K. Let's go, I'm buying lunch..."

257   The pegasus' major flight feathers nearly brushed the stone as she banked
258 into the cinnamon-smelling cloud.  The ceasless twitching of her reality-sense
259 continued, at perhaps a reduced rate, for she had come so far in her travels
260 that each movement snapped her into another reality.  At least moving out of
261 the more mutable realities had slowed down the rate of change.  Like a movie
262 slowing down, the smooth transition from one reality to another slowed down
263 to a flickering, jerkey sucession of still frames.  The cinnamon smell waxed
264 and waned through these transitions, but the pegasus was not ready for the
265 sight that confronted her as with a final snap the cloud dissapated.
266   The pegasus found herself adrift in an endless golden sky.  No ground lay
267 beneath her, she found herself in weightless in an endless sphere of gold,
268 laced by thin tendrils of deep black twining in tendrils and curls in what 
269 could be the far distance, or perhaps near at hand.  The sudden loss of weight
270 threw her into a momentary panic, but the reassuring rush of air past her 
271 wings allayed her fears.  She looked curiously about her, anxious to resume
272 her quest, but unsure of how to escape this reality.
273   A creature of motion, the pegasus did not reflect and ponder her actions as
274 you or I might -- for her to think was to act, and with a careful flex of her
275 mighty wings, she began to spead off toward one of the black tendrils that 
276 seemed slightly larger -- or perhaps closer.  A considerable time passed, 
277 convincing the pegasus that the black shape that was her destination lay quite
278 some distance away.  She had increased her speed several times, and the black 
279 shape seemed no larger than when she had begun.  The rush of air seemed faster
280 than she could remember from a power dive in her home reality -- indeed, she 
281 had seen several objects that had seemed to be afloat here.  They had gone past
282 with a quite satisfying velocity, a speed that caused her to keep a keen lookout
283 ahead.  Beating her wings only enough to maintain her airspeed, the 
284 pegasus arrowed into the gleaming golden sky.

286      I just heard on KOAP that 5000 teenagers a year are killed by drunk

291 
292 	The world had finally outgrown its pubescent muscle flexing, and
293 had settled down to solving the problems at hand. No longer did politicians
294 guide millions to fight over ideological differences. No longer did the
295 economically lower class revolt at the drop of a hat against those above
296 them. In the decades after the genocidal war in Asia, where man finally
297 learned first hand the horrors he courted with his crude nuclear weapons,
298 progress was finally made on a global scale to prevent further conflicts.
299 Almost more importantly, progress was made to prevent the desire to even
300 keep standing armies or stockpiles of weapons. This was the first thing
301 man had to conquer: his age old desire to eradicate his fellow man. It
302 took many years, and many martyrs, but in the end, the last of the
303 nationalistic war mongers were defeated, and the human race could get on
304 with living outside the fear of war and destruction, and focus its
305 collective energies upon solving the problems of their planet.
306 
307 	With the ties to military development severed, science flourished.
308 Techniques that were ignored before, since they had limited military
309 potential, were finally given the chances they deserved. Discoveries and
310 developments in medicine, food production, and natural phenomenon
311 helped establish scientists as the heroes of the masses, who until now,
312 were at the mercy of the inadequacies of the pre-genocide governments.
313 
314 	Although improvement didn't come immediately, the trickle-down
315 effect eventually became more like a downpour, and there wasn't a man, women,
316 or child on the face of the earth who didn't benefit. Science was the
317 way out of the man-made hell-hole dug before the genocide. Science
318 enabled the entire planet to flourish, and hope replaced hunger as
319 the guiding light to millions.
320 
321 	Politically, drastic changes were the order of the day. After the
322 genocide war, a new world government rose from the ashes. Man had learned
323 from his mistakes of the past, and this government was like no other before it.
324 Leaders were chosen based solely on their ability to lead, rather than
325 their ability as a political entity.
326 
327 	The faction at the forefront of this tidal wave of reform was known
328 as the Viable Democrats. The name is a throwback to the politics of old, but
329 their ideas certainly were not. Their ideology was based in part on an
330 obscure political science book entitled "The Viable Democracy".
331 
332 	The book described a society where a world community thrived on
333 ideals of equality and freedom. The key to equality, the book contended,
334 was the sharing of both economic wealth, and interestingly enough,
335 information wealth. The book in no way proposed another socialist state.
336 Quite the contrary, it stated there would always be a need for different
337 economic classes. What it proposed was to keep the lower classes happy;
338 their economic status should be high enough to keep them above well-
339 defined poverty levels, and to provide all citizens with equal opportunity
340 in regards to employment, medical care, living conditions, and entertainment.
341 The authors contended that it wasn't the goal of every one to be rich,
342 but to be successful providers and to be above the daily grind of
343 survival. Economic development was the first goal, since the development
344 of this aided in the development of all other worthwhile goals.
345 
346 	The other major point of the book was the growing problem of the
347 information-poor. Society had seen a remarkable increase in the amount of
348 information it disseminated. Seven out of ten workers were employed in the
349 business of information gathering, processing, and distribution. But a
350 growing dissension among the lower classes was building to the point of
351 explosion. The economically rich were naturally becoming the information
352 rich. And most rational men realized that information was far more valuable
353 than money. Information was a means to power, money, success, and everything
354 else men craved for. "The Viable Democracy" decreed that the path to a
355 world community was paved with bricks of free information to all.
356 
357 	At any other time, such talk would have been considered Utopian
358 nonsense. But in a post-genocide world, where science was an influence
359 growing by leaps and bounds, the masses were ripe for the rhetoric of
360 the Viable Democrats, and this twentieth century tome became the bible
361 of the burgeoning world community. After a few years, the Viable
362 Democrats became the driving force behind World Government, and through
363 their direction, most of the aspects of "The Viable Democracy" came to
364 pass.
365 
366 	National boundaries were a thing of the past. Regions, or Geographs
367 as they came to be called, were defined by geographical boundaries. Since
368 there were no more country boarders, travel between Geographs was not
369 restricted. The enormous logistical problems of such a free and open
370 society were staggering, but with the advances made in science, and after
371 many years of trial and error, a system amicable to the entire world
372 populace was hammered out. Communications and travel across the globe
373 were unrestricted. Since everyone had the means to gather what they
374 wanted, and the entire world was 'wired', complete harmony was finally
375 achieved.
376 
377 	In the many generations it took for the World Community to develop,
378 another important ideal emerged. The importance of education for all did not
379 escape the government leaders. They felt the greatest threat to the government
380 they had created was the threat of ignorance. Free education for all in
381 all subjects would be needed to accomplish the goal of an educated populace.
382 Education, for the first time in history, held a place of high priority for
383 the powers that be. Schooling systems all over the world received unheard of
384 amounts of money. Advances in teaching methods enabled more and more people
385 to be taught more effectively than ever before. Technology played a major
386 role in the advances. Vocational schooling was made available to all who
387 wanted it. Education for all was the goal, and the government was proud of
388 the fact that it had accomplished its goal.
389 
390 	Science, education, freedom, world peace, and equality as a fact
391 rather than a thought, had lead man to his greatest heights. Man had
392 conquered his self-created inhibitions, and now, the only place to go
393 was up. Great importance was placed in the education for the young. The
394 leaders of the day knew their responsibility to the future, and their
395 way of guaranteeing the future was by investing in the young of today.
396 "An investment that will pay back many times over", quipped one famous
397 statesman.

399 voyeur: I must heartily disagree with you. I fail to see the necessity to
400  constantly compare 2010 with 2001. The film 2001 stands as a masterpiece;
401  a work of incredible beauty and thought. I question if the public, that
402  all powerful all knowledgeable group, would have been any happier if 2010
403  had turned out to be a 2001 clone. I think it is a case of "damned if you
404  do, and damned if you don't."
405 Leonard:Sorry, I am almost finished with the fix-up already. I didn't keep
406  a backup copy around as soon as I was pretty sure things would work out
407  satisfactorily. What can we do about the sub adventure on Compuserve? Is
408  there a way we can upload a patch or something?
409 Mikey:The new archive disks are great! The MSDOS format saves me several
410  hours as well as several gallons of GA$.
411 Dune Team:G. Minsky will be available for a Friday night movie run, if the
412  interest still exists. After the great success of our B. Banzai voyage, I
413  say let us go for two out of two. We need to check on theaters.
414 voyeur again: I am a bit disturbed by this recent unofficial NET activity.
415  It's not so much the story line, but the so-called agents who are handling
416  the story have presented no credentials to their competence in accordance
417  to long-standing NET bylaws. I think we need to consult Ian with this, and
418  if possible, return Petrov to the fold. All agents should be notified of this
419  new activity. Time to bring up the comsets, and as the famous saying goes:
420  "Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed."

423      Dr. Frankenstupe sat hunched over his typewriter.  An overflowing 
424 ashtray was on the table next to him.  He hummed a tune while he wrote.
425 Every so often his brow would furrow as he searched for an appropriate
426 word.
427      The man in the white coat paused in the doorway for a moment then
428 he walked up to Frankenstupe and placed a hand on his shoulder.  "Doctor,
429 you should stop now.  'The Young and Restless' is on television.  It's
430 your favorite show."
431      Frankenstupe looked up, a gleam in his eye.  "I can't watch it now.
432 I've got to write.  It's been two months  since I've written... It's time
433 to write again.  I'm inspired."
434      The man in the white coat looked puzzled.  "But Doctor, you never miss
435 your soap.  Are you feeling alright?"
436      "Yes, yes.  Of course I'm feeling alright.  I've been to the Inn again.
437 The great writers are starting to put in an appearance.  Pamela was there...
438 and the Dragon Lady.  There's even a new guy called Sondargaard.  They blew
439 me away."  Frankenstupe waved his hand impatiently.  "Leave me alone. 
440 They've inspired me.  I have to write."
441       "Doctor, we may have to stop you from going to the Inn.  It's 
442 dangerous to your mental health."  The man in the white coat awaited a 
443 reply.  Frankenstupe ignored him, his attention focused on the typewriter.
444 The man in the white coat shook his head and walked away.  He would have
445 to report this to the Director.

449 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (oh...)
450 Dr Frankenstupe, I thank you for the compliment. It has just dawned on me that
451    'Inspiration inspires inspiration.'  It seems that, yes, I will have to 
452    start taking time off from the constant drudge of work and change to make my
453    entries a somewhat constant occurance.   I'm glad to see another return.
454    And I think they have it all wrong-- I think your therapy may be over soon.

457 AH YES. FAIRIES AND FLOWERS AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS. TRA LA LA LA LA LA LA.
458 HOW HAPPY I AM TO BE ALIVE, WANDERING THE FOREST LIKE THE DAY I WAS BORN.
459 HOW NICE IT IS TO FROLICK AS I DID SO LONG AGO, AMID THE HILL AND DALE OF
460 MY COUNTRY HOME..I WANT TO GO ON LIKE THIS FOREVER, NEVER STOPPING, NEVER
461 STOPPING, UNTIL I GROW OLD, AND NO LONGER CARE FOR THE FRESH AIR IN MY
462 NOSTRILS, AND THE SUNNY SKYS UPON MY FACE. PURE PARADISE, LIKE THAT OF
463 LORE, HAS COME TO MY SOUL, LIKE A KINDRED FRIEND LONG DEPARTED, BUT NEVER
464 VERY FAR. I SPY A FOREST ANIMAL, HUDDLED IN FEAR AT THE SIGHT OF MY
465 PRANCING, BUT AS I COME NEAR, THE FEAR IS WASHED AWAY IN A SHOWER OF LOVE,
466 FOR I AM THE FRIEND OF ALL THE FOREST ANIMALS. I TREASURE THEIR TRUST, AND
467 THEY RELISH IN MY BEING. EXISTANCE IN THE DEEP FORRESTS, WHERE ANGRY MAN
468 DARES NOT TROD, IS A PEACEFUL AND JOYOUS THING. I CAN LIVE MY LIFE THE WAY
469 I WISH, SEPARATED FROM THE PURVEYOR OF HATE AND GREED AND LUST. I CLEANSE
470 THE FOREST, AND IN TURN I AM CLEANSED. COEXISTANCE IS HARMONIOUS, PURE,
471 AND PRECIOUS. THE CHAIN IS UNBROKEN, ITS LINKS EACH STRONG INDIVIDUALLY,
472 YET ITS TOTAL IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. I CAN SIT UNDER A FERN,
473 ITS TENDER GREENS COVERING ME WITH A GENTLE TOUCH, AND DELIGHT IN THE SIMPLE
474 WONDERS OF THE FOREST. LIFE HAS BEEN SO GREAT TO ME, I SIMPLY HAD TO SHARE
475 MY JOYOUS TRAVELS WITH ALL OF YOU. PERHAPS WE WILL MEET SOME DAY IN THE
476 FOREST, BUT UNTIL THEN, LIVE YOUR LIFE TO THE FULLEST, IMAGINE YOURSELF IN
477 A FOREST, AND NEVER NEVER DESPAIR.

483   Hi!  I just spent about an hour walking home in the snow
484 and I loved it!  It comes around once a year and that is the best 
485 time for me.  The smell of the air, how cold inside it makes me feel,
486 it's neet.  Today before I could get outside I could just sit and watch
487 from inside.  I couldn't wait to go outside.  I grabbed my books and coat
488 and started home.  Now I have to dry out my scarf and also my hair, oh what
489 a mess, but I love it!  The christmas feeling is getting to me and  don't
490 think it's going to go away very easily, I hope not.  
491   Oh: I would like to try and write a story of some kind but I don't 
492 think it could ever be very good.  I could try.  Maybe I could some day
493 be as good as Pam or the Innkeeper or Kathy.
494   Argh: I don't like it when I can't find my fuzzy slippers when my
495 feet are cold.  Maybe I left them on my bed... Oh well, I'll find them.
496 Please, Pam-Kathy-Innkeeper, if you have any ideas on a character or story
497 lineplease let me know.  I have too many ideas and they are all mussed up.
498   Oops: I've been taking up too much time, I better go.  Better get those

502 go for it tammy. forget the comments of some would-be mentor. write what you
503 want to write. do not let someone else dictate or distract your imagination.
504 you are far better off to work alone, without the meddling of others. Then
505 you alone are responsible for what is created.

538  for 2010.) We get a certian satisfaction at being the first ones to enter the theator(sort of 
539  a hobby.). Aneyway,If aneyone else wants to join us you are welcom(suggestion:a low 
540  intelligece helps.I never leave home with out mine.).

550 Mikey: I found out how that ESC k sequence works (while trying to figure out
551 another obscure "special effect"). ESC i stores the current cursor position.
552 ESC k moves the cursor to the stored position. Now I *STILL* have to figure
553 out the NEW effect. Somehow while attempting a file xfer I sent SOMETHING
554 that inserted a delay in txe display ( I'd be typing on one system and the
555 M100 would be 2 characters behind! ARRRGHHH!!!!!)
556 "NET" agents & Farley: two minor points.
557  1. ELT transmitters are "standard" equipment on aircraft. They send out a 
558     location signal to help searchers find downed aircraft. Fred SHOULD 
559     know this! 
560  2. A NET agent using a TYPEWRITER! <GASP>! The NET doesn't believe in using
561     paper when electronic storage will do. (much easier to encipher and/or
562     destroy that way!)
563 Voyeur: I opened up our "sick" M1 today. Upon removing the RAM chips (to 
564 check for bad connections), I discovered an oxide coating like you would not
565 believe! Blue, brown, black etc. looked like the pins had been VERY hot. Is
566 this normal?

593      Ontho wanted to know if by slim chance the earthquakes were a way of
594 generating energy in the underground culture. Driven by this idea, the small
595 Inmo was closing in on the power center. Leo's trident was glowing and small
596 sparks were shooting off it in a curious pattern. Ontho watched the direction
597 of the sparks and followed them.  A dome could be seen with a ramp leading
598 up inside of it. Unfortunatly if the two left the disk they would be out in
599 the open with no invisablity shield to protect them. 
600      Leo was pondering their situation, truely it would not be a n easy
601 task to defeat these evil aliens, release Inmo's and children, stop the
602 earthquakes and all without bringing the earth down on top of them. IEEE
603 Leo's journal was full of her observations, and she was down to her last
604 4 pages, "drat!" "I should have brought another along just in case" Next
605 time she would be more prepaired.  Along with all of this Leo was starving,
606 Ontho had just wolfed down his emergency bards and leo had long since eaten
607 her last meal.  "Well, those kids have to eat, don't they?" There has got
608 to be some food around here. Maybe with something in my stomach we will
609 come up with some kind of game plan to get inside that dome. GRRROOWWLLL
