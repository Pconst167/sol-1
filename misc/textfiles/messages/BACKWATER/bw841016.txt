24 	The current adventure reminds me of a song....
25 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
26 	You Bash the Balrog (words: Lee Gold, tune: "Waltzing Matilda")
27 
28 Once a jolly cleric, and a magic-using Elf
29 And a mighty Dwarf with a sword plus three
30 Left their native village, out to get their share of pelf.
31 You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb a tree.
32 Chorus:	You bash the Balrog, you bash the Balrog,
33 	You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb a tree.
34 	Left their native village out to get their share of pelf.
35 	You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb the tree.
36 
37 First they met a Goblin, with a fire-breathing Hound.
38 They bashed, and they smashed, and they scragged him with glee.
39 Afterwards they searched him and a magic potion found.
40 You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb the tree.
41 CHORUS: ... Afterwards they searched him, and a magic potion found.
42 The low-wisdom Swordsman picked it up and drank it down.
43 Changed to a wolf immediately.
44 No one could dispel it, so they headed back toward town.
45 You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb the tree.
46 CHORUS: ...No one could dispell it, so they headed back toward town. ...
47 Then a loud voice bellowed, "Who has slain the Goblin King?"
48 Round turned our heroes; what did they see?
49 Swooping down upon them was a Balrog on the wing.
50 You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb the tree.
51 CHORUS: ...Swooping down upon them was a Balrog on the wing. ...
52 "Help!" screamed the Cleric. "Ditto!" yelled the Elven Mage.
53 The wolf whimpered low, and he tried to flee.
54 The Balrog fell upon them, and his flames began to rage.
55 You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb the tree.
56 CHORUS: ...The Balrog fell upon them, and his flames began to rage. ...
57 They ran through the forest, seeking for a place to hide,
58 Pursued by the Balrog so fierce to see.
59 "Wait, cried the Elf-mage. "I have got a plan," he lied.
60 "You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb the tree."
61 CHORUS: ..."Wait," cried the Elf-mage. "I have got a plan," he lied. ...
62 Once a mighty Balrog slew a cleric and an elf
63 And a smallish wolf who had teeth plus three.
64 Skinned them and tanned their hides and kept them on a closet shelf.
65 CHORUS: ...He skinned them and tanned their hides and kept them on a closet shelf. ...
66 
67 (alternative end verse for poeople who like, nay insist, on happy endings)
68 Once a mighty Balrog slew a jolly cleric and
69 Skinned a smallish wolf who had teeth plus three.
70 But the Elf got away, and he's living with a Dryad band.
71 You bash the Balrog, and I'll climb a tree.

76     "Ahoy Southwind"                                        "Ahoy Southwind"
77 Awaking with a start, the ancient practitioner sat bolt upright in his bunk,
78 just barely stopping short of the overhead. Cracking his head on the deck
79 beams above the bunk was not one of his favorite pastimes. It took a moment
80 to realize why his heart was beating so wildly and every nerve in his body
81 was on full alert. What could possibly have induced such a dream into his
82 head? Crossing the dreaded Kolumbia Bar was notable only by the fact that
83 it had been completely uneventful. Long even swells, a fair breeze, and a
84 slack tide had made the entrance to the river as smooth as silk. A brisk
85 reach up river brought them to his favorite cove among the whispering trees.
86 (Only counting those which lie north of 22.5 degrees Latitude, of course.)
87 Interesting how soundly he had slept last night. When at sea most skippers
88 sleep with one eye open, at least the ones who survive for any length of
89 time do. A 'Safe Harbor', at the end of a long passage, brings just as much
90 joy to the weary sailor, as sight of the open sea after a long time swinging
91 around the hook. That's interesting, he mused in his half awake state... 
92                  But what had awakened him so abruptly?                      
93                                                  "Ahoy Southwind"
94 
95 Why, someone was calling from the shore. "Oh! Wonderful", he said aloud,
96 "Could it be?...Is it?". Anticipation practically levitated him up on deck.

118 Food for thought: something to do while not running after someone of the
119 oposite sex.
120 Why is it that within a community in which most people seem to not dicriminate
121 amongst sexes, races, and religions (exept for the ******* in Antelope) are
122 there so few blacks, women, and other members of the traditionaly discriminated
123 groups?  This community, by the way, is the people who make a living out of

127    *THAT*, which was the essence of the piper was absorbed and bemused, 
128 unaware of the fate of *THAT*'s body.  The central essence of the piper, ithout
129 form, sex, or ego, *THAT* had traveled so far from the piper that it is not
130 even accurate to call *THAT* the piper.  
131    Some concepts simply cannot be communicated in words.  The attempt only
132 confuses he/she who tries to form images in his/her mind from a result of this
133 communication.  Therefore, the following is NOT what happened, but an attempt
134 to render the flavor of the experience in terms that we can visualize.
135 ------ A shining being, covered over by a thin garment was traveling down a
136 long corridor towards a light shining at a far distant end.  The journey was
137 interminable, but at the termination that did not take place, the being entered
138 a large reception area.  Moving through the infinite shining space, the being
139 approached a desk, behind which another being sat.  Approaching the second
140 being, the first being felt a strong feeling of "parent" or "guardian" or 
141 "teacher" from the second.  Seeing the approach of the first, the second being
142 greeted the first, and asked it's choice.e.  (Oh, heck, at the risk of being
143 misunderstood, we'll call the first the piper and the second the teacher.)
144   The piper indicated his misunderstanding of the choice, and the teacher said,
145 "You have stained your garments, how will you clean them?"  The piper again
146 stated his misunderstanding of the choice, and the teacher asked him to follow.
147   The two floated for an indeterminable amount of time throughout the shining
148 infinity that made up that place, the piper noting that the garment that made
149 up his sole covering -- in fact was part of him as well as covering him --
150 was discolored by a large dark stain on one side.  They came upon another 
151 being, who was industriously landering his garment, removing a stain through
152 painstakingly laundering each of its fibers.  Acknowleging this being's 
153 greeting, the two drifted on and came to another being who was coating a 
154 stain on his with a shining white substance.  The covering went on much more
155 easily than the painstaking cleaning of the fibers of the fabric, and left
156 a shining kind of blankness where there once was a flexible weave.  The teacher
157 and the piper followed the last being out into the shining space, the garment
158 of the last being more pure and shining than that of other beings that passed.
159 Suddenly, the being they followed brushed against a stranger.  The white 
160 coating fell off, and the stranger recieved a severe stain on his garment.
161 The being they followed went back to apply another coat of white to the stiff
162 fabric of his apparel.  The piper turned to the teacher and asked to go back
163 to where the being was cleaning his fabric.  At that "place" the being was
164 just cleaning the last fiber.  The soft folds of his fabric seemed to glow
165 with all colors as it absorbed the cleaned area into itself, and seemed to 
166 take on body, texture, and reality from this reabsorbtion of the stained area.
167   Turning to the teacher, the piper indicated that he would occupy himself 
168 with cleaning his garment fiber-by-fiber and forgo the covering option.
169 The teacher indicated pleasure and left the piper to his cleaning task.-------
170   Far away, on a level area on the peak of a rocky needle, the pegasus 
171 sheltered the stiff cold body of the piper.  Holding it under a white wing,
172 she strove to keep the heat of life in his body.  Those with the perception
173 to view such things would see the "shining cord" extending from his body 
174 thinned nearly to the breaking point -- the fires of life ebbing lower and
175 still lower.

183 about any game we played. The abuse of Chard, both in person and on the phone.
184 Getting locked in the bathroom. All are etched in memory, as was the flavor and

232 Trudging along, the party reached the shelter of some caverns at the south side of the Valley.  A river flowed nearby
233 so that wasn't a problem.  The group decided to forgo the fire as to not attract attention.  Milchar tried to cast
234 a Heat spell instead, but failed.  The effort made Milchar sleep.

248   The wind had risen with the fall of night.  As the light failed, the heat
249 of the day had disappeared like memories of promises overdue.  The night sky
250 over the Ruby Valley was cyrstalline clear, lit with a barely perceptible
251 purple skyglow.  Atop a slim needle of rock that penetrated the skyline rimming
252 the valley a figure stirred beneath a soft covering of white feathers.
253   The piper slowly regained conciousness.  Huddling close to the side of the
254 pegasus sheltering him, he felt the bite of the night winds chill his icy 
255 flesh.  Pain lanced through him where the rocks had sucked his body heat
256 into their uncaring bulk.  His flesh felt waxen and molded to shape around
257 the pebbles and cobbles amoung which he had lain; the blood slowly seeping 
258 through his veins seemed to carry sweetly burning fires as it tried to melt
259 and remold the waxen flesh.  He slowly drew himself to his knees, holding 
260 onto the pegasus' patient neck, smelling her hot breath as she nuzzled him
261 in deep concern.  He hugged the neck of the great winged horse weakly, then
262 reached down and opened his sporran.  Fumbling in the dark, he pulled out a
263 soft cloth of some sort, and bushing some of the larger stones aside, cleared
264 a small area under the pegasus' wing flat enough to make a rude bed.  He 
265 folded the fabric into a rough pad, then lay next to the pegasus in the
266 shelter of her wing and sought normal sleep.

303 hate having to learn a new set of mnemonics while trying to write the program!)

318 As the sun arose for the new day, Milchar awakened also.  The Friar was already up, cooking breakfast on a very small 
319 fire inside the cave.  "There's no smoke, nothing to attract attention.", the Friar replied to Milchar's worried frown.
320 "That's not the reason for the frown, I am worried about Piper.  I have not seen him for... a day?  two days?"  Milchar
321 wasn't sure.  "I wonder where our pursuers have gotten to, I wonder why we were chosen, I wonder much.  I wonder if 
322 the breakfast is burning?", Milchar added, smelling a slight smoky odor coming from the Friar's skillet.
323 A Green Stone nearby attracted Milchar's attention.  "Where did this come from?  I don't remember seeing it last night."
324 "Nor I, a pack rat must have brought it here."
325 "I doubt that.  Have you noticed any small animals in the Valley?"
326 "No, come to think of it.  The only small animals I have seen have been birds.  No land creatures."
327 As the Friar spoke, the Stone enveloped Milchar in a hazy green aura, which rapidly faded, bringing the mage along...

333 Thursday evening) is PorSFiS, and some business can perchance be conducted then].
334 piper: Your entries lately leave me in awe.  Not meaning to rain on your
335 parade, but with `competition' like that, the rest are afraid to put up 
336 entries and so be compared (and come up second-best).  I don't really mind;

340 Piper:  If it isn't getting tiring, I'd like, also, to say that that is very
341         fine material.  Also, sorry I haven't contacted you about that Lisp
342         material, but I seem to have misplaced your phone number >>again<<.

344 Ate-byte
345 et al:  I haven't seen any summaries of the last six months activities, did I
346         miss it, or is it too grand a project?  To Ate-Byte, and all others
347         who care, to get onto Rome you need two endorsements from present citi-
348         zens.  Friar Tuck and The Piper are the only two citizens that frequent
349         BWMS if you don't use any other boards.  When you call as a new user,

383    The first sunbeams of dawn stole over the rocky hills, trickled through
384 branches and leaves and played their usual jokes and games with the night 
385 shadows.  Some of the more adventurous infiltrated the space under the wing
386 of a white beast atop a rocky spire overlookng the valley, and proceeded to 
387 play tag over the exhausted face of the man who lay there.
388   The piper woke hard.  Normally the lure of a new day pulled him out of the
389 arms of sleep, snapped his eyes open, and gave him an eagerness to get going
390 in the early morninge.  Today, however, it seemed that he was bone-weary.
391   A glance at the horizon to orient himself ... odd... ten feet                                                                 392 TEN FEET! suddenly the piper came fully awake.  The soft inquiring sound
393 from the pegasus took his attenetion.  Caught by the love in her eyes, the 
394 piper lay enveloped in her concern just as in her wings for a long luxurious
395 moment.  Concern came to the fore of his mind again.  How did he get here?
396 Where was here?  Where was breakfast?  How could he eliminate the distance?
397   Pressing into her warm side, the piper slid carefully out of the shelter
398 of her wing, slowly got to his feet and stretched the pain from his muscles.
399 The pegasus had chosen the top of a rocky spire, nearly twenty feet square,
400 jutting up from the valley's rim.  The view was superb, but how had he gotten
401 here?  He had the vague feeling that something had happened, somehow his life
402 had changed, but no memory of what or how.
403   Looking around, he saw that his vantage point was flanked by ever higher 
404 mountains to the south and west, to the east the valley dipped down to the 
405 gazebo where the party                         !                    The party... how could he have forgotten?
406   He turned back to the pegasus to see her rising.
407   No four-footed beast but the cat family is truly graceful when rising.  
408 Even the large cats have moments of less than perfect grace when they arise
409 from sleep.  The pegasus was far from a cat, and her rise was hindered by a
410 pair of wings that were of considerable bulk, even folded.  The piper stepped
411 quickly over to her and began to stroke  and massage her muscles.

427 It had been a very cold night in the cave.  Taking my Bluet stove from my kit, I lit it and
428 began making powdered scrambled eggs, and dehydrated bacon.  Milchar awoke, and looked at
429 me like I was going to cause our ruin with the fire. "It doesn't smoke.", I reassured him.
430 He was worried about Piper.  I, for an odd reason, was not.  I had dreamed of him last night,
431 and he was alright, but I felt that he was not going to be our merry piper for some time.
432 Milchar was looking at a green rock, and while we were discussing it, he vanished.  "Well,
433 at least he could have eaten some breakfast.", I said to myself.  "May I have some ?", said
434 someone behind me, "It smells delicious."
435 Startled, I turned around and saw                  nothing.  There was no one there.  Again, I heard the voice,
436 "I can pay nothing, but I know the area well, and perhaps you would like a travelling companion".
437 "That is fine, but would you make yourself visible ?  It would help if I could see you."
438 "It is not my visibility that is a concern, but your lack of ability to see."
439 I turned back to my skillet and pondered that.  "I may not be able to see you, but you are more than
440 welcome to share breakfast with me, and I would dearly love to have a travelling companion.  Everyone
441 else seems to keep dissappearing on me, so I guess it doesn't matter if you can't be seen by me."
442 With that, I dished up two plates, piled high, and set them on the table.  I said grace, and was
443 somewhat surprized to hear "Amen" from behind me again.  Turning, I saw a 30 year old woman pulling
444 out the chair beside me.  "Please, eat your fill, and then you may tell me about yourself."  I said,
445 delighted that I could at last see her.

465 Grattus leaned over the flames trying to see if his dehydrated water had skipped ahead to a boil yet. He was greeted by smoke.
466   Even as his eyes tried to clense their polished surface Ascomb awoke with unusual earliness. Wiping blonde curls from her
467 cheek, she mumbled something about decency and asked S-EFTY something about clothes.
468   Grattus dropped the tea bags into the boil. Then sat down at thvelveteen couch. Waiting for Ascomb to do the same.
469   Ascomb stabbed her arms deep into her robe and stepped hastily into her slippers, anxious to get near the fire.
470   She darted past the ornately laid breakfast table trying to get to the couch. She stumbled a bit, but made it after all.
471   Grattus tried to make conversation by mentioning that someone really ought to replace the candlabra's candles, as they had
472 melted past the length of the wick.
473   Ascomb said that she would do this, and asked S-FTEY about her clothes for the day.
474   S-FTEY said guiltily "Haven't started yet, Ma'am, I am still working on the Universal Solvent formula Master Grattus wanted
475 last night."
476   Indignantly Ascomb glared at Grattus (It was no accident Ascomb didn't have her clothes yet...) and tried to use logic.
477   "You cant produce Universal Solvent S-FTEY, it will dissolve your insides." Ascomb waited for a reply.
478   "I will have your clothes in five minutes, Ma'am." S-FTEY never admitted a mistake, he got very embarrassed about these thi-
479 ngs, for an Android.
480   A leaf fell from the tallest spire of a moss blanketed tree, abnd floated onto the coffee table.

507 Mikey:  I hate to say this, but by the look of the crasher (for those of you
508         who don't know, he used up 150 lines by typing <CR>)  I think you
509         should go to a *gasp* password system.  Most of the contributors to
510         this board are frequent contibutors,  so it wouldn't need too many
511         passwords.
512 
513 Now then, the Piper's story has inspired me to make my own story, but with a
514 different message...
515    He woke up in the morning and thought about it.  There was nothing unusual
516 about that.  Every morning, every evening it battled out in his brain.  Truth
517 and hapiness.  That was the key to his torment.  This was not an average man,
518 this was a seeker of truth.  Of course, he did not know all, nor did he attempt
519 to.  But in all that he saw, all that he heard, he looked for the truth.  He
520 did not attempt to cover up, he had no facade.  But this gave him a problem:
521 Could he be happy without ignoring the truth sometimes?  On his way to work he
522 saw two woman in a cafe'.  They were laughing drily at some comment.  He imma-
523 gined the fronts they put up towards each other and towards others.  He walked
524 on.  He spent the rest of the day at the office and went home without a word.
525 He had few friends, most people would refer to him as "sombre" or "depressing."
526 He spent the rest of the evening reading and thinking -- never smiling.  This
527 went on for the better part of his entire life.  Shortly after his fifty-fourth
528 birthday, he fell ill and never recovered.  This didn't surprise those who knew
529 him.  "He never had any fun, he never loved anyone" said one woman who had
530 known him as well as anyone.  He laid upon his death-bed and looked at the peo-
531 ple around him, and he smiled.  His life had been by most accounts miserable,
532 but he had one thing that these people didn't have, the one thing that made
533 him smile.  He knew the truth.

536                  THE OREGON STATE DEPARTMENT OF FISH & WILDLIFE
537 
538 The 1984-1985 Big Game season in the State of Oregon will be closed due to the
539 shortage of big game animals.  The following will not be hunted within this
540 state's boundaries this season:  deer, elk, antelope, bear, cougar and squirrels.
541      However, in the place of the game animals, there will be an open season on
542 the central eastern Rajneesh, known locally as the Red Rats or Red Vermin.
543      These Red Rats may be a little rough to dress out and if gut shot,
544 probably not worth the effort.
545 
546 IT WILL BE UNLAWFUL TO:
547    1.  Hunt in a party of over 700 hunters;
548    2.  Use more than 50 attack dogs in one group;
549    3.  Use less than a 25 caliber rifle or double 00 buckshot
550        (they are thick skinned).
551 TRAPPING REGULATIONS:
552    1.  Traps may not be set withing 15 feet of a voting booth.
553    2.  Traps may not be baited with a virgin, food stamps, welfare stamps
554        or a Rolls-Royce.
555    3.  All traps must have not less than a 120 pound spring.  The trap jaws
556        must be kept sharp and in good working order.
557 OTHER RULES AND REGULATIONS:
558    1.  It is unlawful to possess a road-killed Red Rat.  It is OK to hit one,
559        but don't pick the bastard up.
560    2.  It is unlawful to use any recorded or amplified device to trap a Red Rat,
561        with the exception of the following: a recording of Crystal Gayle's
562        "Don't It Make Your Brown Eyes Blue".
563 HOW TO KNOW WHEN A RED RAT IS IN THE AREA:
564    1.  You spot a Rolls-Royce with a deaf mute in the back seat.
565    2.  You see 5 or more Rolls-Royces together.
566    3.  Disposable diapers thrown on the street.
567    4.  Large line outside the Wasco County Welfare Office.
568    5.  Empty books of food stamps thrown on the ground.
569 
570 Obviously, red hunting vests should be exchanged for some other color.

579 It seems as though there are a lot of literary people that use the this 
580 BBS.  Keep u}p theood  work!!!!!!!  It was fun to read your comments.      
581 
582 To All Concerned:  I think that this is the best bbs that I've ever read over my
583 brother's shoulder. The Fiction is fantastic (despite the ravings of the 8888888
584 Club) and I hope to make some small contribution at a later date. I go to school
585 at OSU, so I'm afraid that you'll only hear from me on vacations and some holida
586 ys. But I'll work on a short that'll make it worth the wait...
587      (The name is Tolkiens Elvish, and I'll take bets on what it means...)

594 What a way to share some very good sci-fi/fantasy and perhaps help
