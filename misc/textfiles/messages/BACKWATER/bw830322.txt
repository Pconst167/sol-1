96 TO THE USER THAT HAD A QUESTION IN REGARD TO MOD III DISK DRIVES...
97 
98 I DON'T OWN ANY MYSELF (I DON'T HAVE A TRS-80), BUT I USE THEM EVERY WEEKDAY.
99 THEy ARE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE, TRSDOS IS A POWERFUL O.S. AND THEY HAVE A GREAT
100 (BUT NOT TOO UNUSUAL) AMOUNT OF HIGH SPEED STORAGE, ABOUT 170-180K FORMATTED
101 STORAGE. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE DOS GIVES YOU ERROR NUMBERS INSTEAD OF
102 MESSAGES, BUT BY TYPING ERROR ## (wHERE ## IS THE ERROR NUMBER THAT wAS RECIEvED
103 ) THE COMPUTER WILL PRINT THE ERROR MESSAGE AFTER READING A FILE TO FIND IT OUT
104 
105 THE DISK IS STANDARD FORMAT (256 BYTES PER SECTOR, 5 SECTORS PER GRANULE), BUT
106 IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH THE MOD I IN ANY WAY, HOWEVER A PROGRAM CALLED CONVERT
107 WILL CONVERT PROGRAMS ON A MOD I DISK TOMOD III FORMAT (BY LOADING THEM OFF OF
108 * * COPY DISK ERROR * *
109 THE MOD I DISK AND TRANSFERING IT TO THE MOD III DISK. THIS REQ. 2 DISK DRIVES.
110 
111 ANYWAY, FOR THE INITIAL COST, A DISK DRIVE FOR THE MOD III IS WELL WORTH THE
112 INVESTMENT... THAT GOES FOR ANY COMPUTER...
113 
114 ONE PROBLEM THAT I SHOULD MENTION,
115 IS THAT THE MOD III PASSWORD PROTECTION SYSTEM IS VERY DIFICULT TO GET AROUND.
116 IN FACT, IF YOU PROTECT A PROGRAM WITH A PASSWORD, AND THEN FORGET THE PASSwORD,
117 THEN YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF LUCK. IT IS POSSIBLE TO KILL THE PROGRAM WITH
118 THE DISK MASTER PASSORD (IF YOU KNOW IT), BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP MUCH.
119 
120 THE DISK IS FORMATTED AS DOUBLE DENSITY, SINGLE SIDED, 40 TRACKS.

234 About that Certification....
235 The 3M rep has admitted to me that the diskettes are certified "statisticaly"
236 You don't have a problem except when a BATCH of media has been down graded.
237 This is why one whole box can have problems, different job lots.  The "cer-
238 tification" is actually a warranty, if it don't work as advertised, it will
239 be replaced.  
240 On that vein, I was told by a customer that he had bought 3M diskettes from
241 the Sears Business Center for $45.00 [on sale!] and one of them would not 
242 format.  On return he was told by the  clerk "tough".  So much for reputable

347 AS WE MOVE AHEAD IN THIS ADMINISTRATION WE ARE PRESENTLY LIVING UNDER
348 ,IT BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT IT IS PRO-BUSINESS AND VERY ANTI UNION AS
349 THEY TIGHTEN THE CHOKE HOLD ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE-CREATING A SYSTEM
350 OF HAVES AND HAVENOTS-PITTING THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER.KETCUP AS A 
351 VEGTABLE SOUNDS GOOD ON PAPER BUT NOT VERY WILL IN PRACTICE.AS THE
352 PROBLEMS MOUNT HERE AT HOME ,IT SEEMS WE KEEP SENDING THE RESOURCES
353 THAT COULD HELP THE PROBLEM HERE TO OTHER COUNTRIES-IT IS "AID" AS
354 THEY CALL IT OR JUST MORE AGITATION IN THE  GOVT. SYSTEMS OF OTHER
355 COUNTRIES-BECAUSE I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE THE PEOPLE WE ARE SUPPOSE
356 TO BE HELPING BENIFIT FROM THIS AID BUT JUST A INCREASE IN THE
357 AGGRESSION AGAINST THE COMMON PERSON BY MILITARY POWER STRUCTURES.
359

361 THE TIME TO PARTICIPATE IS NOW BY BEING ACTIVE  IN VOTING AND TELL-

363 THERE IS POWER IN NUMBERS-IF WE DON'T-IN THE END WE WILL BE THE
364 LOSERS BY NON-PARTICIPATION. THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT-"WE THE
365 PEOPLE ARE THE GOVERNMENT". LET'S CANCEL OUT APATHY AND START CHANGE
366 NOW.THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH LARGE OR SMALL COMPANIES MAKING
367 BIG PROFITS BUT WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH OR SOME COUNTRY DECIDES
368 TO NATIONALIZE THEIR COMPANIES-LET THEM NOT START EXPORTING JOBS
369 AND ASKING FOR SUBSIDIES AND HAVING OUR MILITARY GET INVOLVED BUT
370 START TAKING CARE OF THERE WORKERS AND CONSUMERS AT HOME. A STRONG
371 MILITARY BUDGET WITH ARMS WILL NOT PROTECT THE COMMON PERSON WHO
372 HAS LOST HIS JOB,UN-EMPLOYMENT BENIFITS ,HIS HOUSE AND POSSIBLY
373 HIS FAMILY AND SELF-WORTH TOO.BECAUSE THE WORKER IS THE CORE OF

380   Sadly, there seems to be little showing me why a policy of anti-union
381 practices is not justified.  Unions have had their time and place, but
382 I feel the time is past and the place is lost.  I'm not for all out
383 exploitation of the worker (blue- or white-collar) on the part of the
384 corporation.  Neither can I condone exploitation of the workers by the
385 very people they elected or hired to watch out for their interests.
386   Stop and think about it... is a guy screwing on rear-view mirrors in
387 Detroit really worth $10 per hour or more??  Who is benefitting from 
388 these overly inflated wages?

390 :::::::::::::::::::::::::
391 Ditto.  If you know what the Robinson-Patman Act is (government jobs
392 must pay the 'prevailing' (ie, UNION) wage rate), you'll understand why
393 the government needs to be less pro-union.  By the way, unions are
394 specifically exempted from the Sherman anti-trust act.  Why?  The
395 Sherman anti-trust act prohits 'restraint of trade.'  I.E., no
396 monopolies.  However, a union is the most obvious monopoly there is.
397 That act was intended by unions to be a weapon against business, but
398 they soon found out they were even more obvious violators.  So Congress
399 had to jump in and specifically exempt unions.  Anti-union?  C'mon now,
400 I WISH congress was anti-union.
401 	If you want to complain about something, complain about taxes.
402 The Constitution prohibits 'involuntary servitude' (slavery) yet
403 taxes are clearly intended to be involuntary, and represent a portion
404 of one's efforts and wealth.
405 	Challenge to all:  Give me a definition of the word 'THEFT'
406 that does not also include taxation.  Example definition:  Theft is
407 the involuntary removal of property from some person or organization
408 .  Clearly, this definition includes taxation.  Can you find one that
409 doesn't?  Probably not.
410 	Don't assume that government should be able to do things no
411 individual can do.  Just because it's government does not make its
412 actions legal.
413 
414 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
415 I wish the real world wa as simple as the last few messages imply. There
416 is a lot to be said against militarism, but without an army we would be 
417 overrun immediately. Taxation is not theft, as that is "illegally taking,
418 and by definition taxes are legal. There is more to it than that, of 
419 course, but lets not worry too much about defining theft, only about
420 preventing it. (We all know what it is.) As to taxes, we all hate them,
421 but can't live without them. The government of the US may not be perfect,
422 or even quite what we want, but try some of the others: do you really
423 want to live in Siberia? As to stampimg out apathy, so you really want
424 to? Remember, the nonvote makes yours more powerful. And be glad they
425 aren't voting, because those who aren't would vote for more subsidies
426 (for themselves), and that means more taxes.

459 their own good.  They have problems with the "half track" and "psuedo-
460 sector" nonsense used to protect games and other such software.  They wk
461 neat, rather expensive, and look good.  I baught Micro-Sci A2's from
462 the Hollywood Computer Center.  Bill gave me such a deal!  They seem to 
463 work exactly like Apple drives, not well, mind you, but just like Apple.
464                                        the Phantom Glitch
465 P.S. Computerland in Tigard had some around, they might want to deal...

467 REPONSE TO ANALOG ALAN-
468 
469 THE IDEAS ABOUT GOVERNMENT AND THE MITITARY WHERE NOT MEANT TO STATE
470 THAT A SYSTEM OF PROTECTION VIA A "ARMY" WAS AGAINST OUR OWN BEST IN-
471 TEREST OR GOOD,BUT IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE USED ON A WORLD
472 BASIS.THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHICH SYSTEM WE USE, BUT WHAT WE CAN
473 DO TO CHANGE THEM AND THERE USE FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF EVERYONE ON
474 THIS PLANET POSSIBLE.IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHERE YOU WANT TO LIVE
475 OR WHAT POLITICAL SYSTEM YOU LIVE UNDER-YOU WILL STILL BE AFFECTED BY
476 THOSE FORCES.THE POINT IS THAT MORE INVOLVEMENT BY PEOPLE CAN CHANGE
477 THINGS THAT WE INCOUNTER EVERY DAY AND REALLY HAVE A EFFECT.I CAN
478 AGREE AND RELATE TO YOUR STATEMENT ON UNIONS BUT THE HISTORICAL
479 BACKGROUND OF MANGEMENT AND WORKER GO WAY BACK BEFORE JOE HILL AND 
480 THE WOBBLIES , AND THERE HAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE GAP PROFIT AND
481 WAGES AND THE QUESTION OF PRODUCTION.WHO IS SERVING WHO AND FOR WHAT
482 PURPOSE.

484 
485 YOUR RESPONSE WAS RECIEVED AND INTERESTING-THANK YOU,THE O.J.KID.

491 TO PUT IT SUCCINCTLY;I'M LOOKING FOR A ASSEMBLY PROGRAM FOR 6502 THAT CREATES
492 A SOURCE 'FILE' WITH MNEMONIC & OPERHAND INSTRUCTIONS FROM A OBJECT FILE OR
493 PROGRAM,SO I CAN THEN ENTER THE SOURCE 'FILE' INTO A MACRO ASSEMBLER EDITOR.
494 THEN RE-EDIT THE OLD OBJECT PROGRAM. THE KEY HERE IS TO CREATE A NEW SOURCE
495 FILE NOT JUST DISSASSEMBLE THE OBJECT CODE. CONFUSED?? I AM !!

497 ========================
498 Contrary to the above statement, taxes are not necessarily legal.  
499 Obviously, it is possible for governments to do illegal things:
500 most obvious example, Watergate, segregation (Dred Scot decision),
501 internment of Japanese in WW2, theft of Indian lands.  Our 
502 Constitution prohibits taking property from a person without a hearing,
503 yet we are told we must pay taxes with no such hearing.
504 	I repeat:  Do NOT assume that because the government does it,
505 it's legal.  Second, taxation is a form of somewhat diluted slavery, as
506 is the draft.  Normally, when a citizen is a victim of a robbery, the
507 government will aid in bringing the crook to justice.  However, when
508 it's government doing the stealing, not only can you not get justice,
509 but if you attempt to resist this theft, they can and will put you
510 in jail, etc.
511 	No, we (the taxpayers) don't need taxes.  The only ones
512 that need taxes are the leeches in our society who expect to live
513 at the expense of others.  The system is quite predictable:  If you
514 give people votes on the basis of 1 vote/person, you can expect that
515 people will tend to vote to steal money from the well-off minority.
516 This is human nature, as far as I can tell.
517 	If one person steals from you, that's robbery.  If a hundred
518 do it, that's a riot.  If a million do it, that's taxes.
519 	My challenge still is open:  Make a general definition of 'theft'
520 that does NOT also include taxation.  So far it appears no one has done
521 so, which is not surprising.  Remember, governments can steal just as
522 effectively as individual, even more so in many circumstances.  The
523 only fundamental difference is that governments are often never
524 punished for that theft.
525 ==========================================================
526 Since you have chosen to call taxes "theft" you will not accept the truth,
527 so I will not try to dissuade you. The rest of you reading this, please
528 ignore the preceeding. Taxes are how we pay for things we want to use
529 by all (or most of ) the people, like protection (army, etc.), public
530 roads, crime protection (police and courts), and what are called
531 "social programs" (such as unemployement compensation and poverty programs,
532 as well as a lot of others we don't hear as much about). If you want
533 crime prevention it is necessary  to pay for it, and fire departments
534 don't come cheap.
535    Those who have not lived long enough to have experienced being without
536 money usually don'
537 t like what they call "dole" or "give-away", but those who have needed
538 them are often more reasonable. In any case it is important for crime
539 prevention to reducer poverty.
540    Not all that those in the government are doing legal things, but
541 this can not be called actions of the government. Nixon was a criminal,
542 not the US government. Don't confuse the two. "They" is a convenient
543 enemy, but when it includes both bad and good it is not correct.
544    In other words: GROW UP!

549 HI MIKE,  JUST THIS NOTE TO LET YOU KNOW I GOT AMODEM RUNNING FINE
550 BETWEEN MY CCS AND KAYPRO AT 9600 BAUD.  GREAT!!  MY PROBLEM WAS
551 THAT I PUT A BAUD RATE INIT IN THE "SETMOD" ROUTINE (TO 19200
552 WISHFULLY) AND DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE CALLING SETMOD ANYWHERE BUT
553 ONCE INITIALLY IN AMODEM.  I FIXED THINGS BY PUTTING A "FIRSTTIME"
554 FLAG IN SETMOD.  ONCE I GOT THE COMPUTERS TALKING TO EACH OTHER AT
555 THE SAME BAUD...19200 BAUD DON'T GO--YOU WERE RIGHT.  I'M CURIOUS
556 TO SEE WHAT FEATURES THE NEXT VERSION OF AMODEM WILL HAVE.

558 TO B.A.D AND OTHER ON GOVERNMENT...
559 GOVERNMENT IS A COERCIVE JURISDICTIONAL MONOPOLY.  THIS IS A VIEW
560 POPULAR AMONG LIBERTARIANS.  I THINK IT IS A VERY GOOD DEFINITION.
561 THERE IS A VAST VOLUME OF LITERATURE SHOWING THAT THE SERVICES
562 WE CURRENTLY ATTRIBUTE TO GOVERNMENT CAN AND SHOULD BE PROVIDED
563 BY A FREE MARKET.  AS FAR AS TAXATION IS CONCERNED IT RELYS ON A
564 PROCESS OF INITIATION OF FORCE BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THAT MAKES
565 TAXATION INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THEFT.  IN MY OPINION, GOVERNMENT
566 IS THE WORST HOAX THAT HAS EVER BEEN PERPETRATED ON AND BY 
567 MANKIND.  THROUGHOUT HISTORY GOVERNMENTS HAVE CAUSED UNTOLD MISERY
568 AND OCEANS OF BLOOD.  ALL BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE (AND ARE) TO 
569 IGNORANT TO ACHIEVE GOALS THROUGH PRODUCTIVE MEANS RATHER THAN
570 THRU THE INITIATION OF FORCE.  THE "GROW UP" ARGUMENT IS THE 
571 FIRST RESORT OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO DIRECT ATTENTION AWAY FROM
572 THEIR OWN NAIVETE BY ACCUSING OTHERS OF THEIR OWN FAILING.  
573 FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN STUDYING WHETHER GOVERNMENT IS NECESSARY
574 AT ALL I SUGGEST THEY CONTACT THE LOCAL LIBERTARIAN PART AT
575 281-xxxx -- AT LEAST THAT USED TO BE THEIR NUMBER.  ALSO A VERY
576 GOOD BOOK (AVAILABLE THROUGH MOST LIBERTARIAN PARTY HEADQUARTERS)
577 IS: "SOCIETY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT" BY TANNEHILL AND WOLLSTEIN.

606 Although I normally don't get into this sort of argument, (it is the surest
607 way of getting people mad at you!) I would like to point out that while many
608 services can indeed be handled by the government, that does not mean that it
609 is nesecarily the best way. Take social security many think of this as a god
610 send. To the less financial responsible yes it is, but to those who bust thier
611 rears in life it is near worthless. So I have to pay for someone to leach off
612 of me because they were too irresponsible in thier early years to consider
613 what they were going to live on when they retire. In the case of fire
614 departments, I might point out that most rural fire departments are run
615 on a volunter basis with little or no tax support. The same with ambulance
616 and rescue services, and in some cases police. How do they handle this?
617 Well, in some cases the little support that is needed is indeed payed for
618 thru taxes, but this is only agreed on by the community at large not forced
619 down their throats by some burocrat who has never even seen the place let
620 alone be aware of their needs. Another way is for the individual to pay for
621 the service just like you would any other service contract. The cost? about
622 $5.00 a month for fire service, and comperable amounts for the others. What
623 if you don't pay? well you can still get the service you will just be charged
624 for the call, just like any other service. Many would say at first that this
625 could never work, but it can and in fact is in many communities. An intersting
626 side effect is it seems to bring the communities closer together. So what
