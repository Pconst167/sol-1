114 "COOKIE CRUMBLER" THOR bids hello and
115 welcome again to his terminal. It has
116 been a long while since THOR has taken
117 time to search at his favorite INN and
118 to see the woman who gave so much 
119 pleasure and time to an old warrior is
120 a wonderful sight indeed. Since THOR
121 has been absent from the INN so long
122 it would be presumptuous to linger for
123 more than is necessary, but THOR would
124 like to know from kathyd if any of the
125 "Old Gang" are hanging out where THOR
126 might visit a night or early morning
127 to hear of great tales and stories as
128 he has missed them sorely. If this
129 message is read by the "COOKIE CRUMBLER"
130 I hope she will answer soon. Again, it

144 "A good song, Bard.", I said from my corner.  "Did it seem somewhat misty
145 to me, or was I reading in my own past ?"
146 "Never the less, I did enjoy it."
147 I turned to my table companion, "You seem a little more firmed up, now.
148 Was it the goodliness of the Benedictine Brothers ?  Or mayhaps a little
149 shot of that potent magic, 'Technology'."  (The last I said while looking
150 carefully at something called a 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer',
151 whatever that might have been.)  "Tell me a tale of where you have been,
152 and what has kept you from the Inn for so long a time.  I myself have only
153 recently returned from a far too healthy dose of reality."
154 I settled back in my chair, took another sip of magical potion, and listened.

162     The mirror is the height of a man. My father or a little smaller. And like
163 it used to be with my father, I have to confront it every day. It stands next
164 to my desk and when I'm frustrated, my reflection curses me.
165  
166     I'm usually frustrated about a case. I handle a lot of cases, and I'm
167 frustrated a lot.
168  
169     Right now, I'm frustrated about a girl and her case. She appeared at my
170 door last month. It was cold and dark. Winter was ending, and Spring's
171 rainstorms were starting.
172  
173     She shivered as she came through my door. I closed it behind her, and
174 glanced into the outer office. My secretary wasn't there.
175  
176     I came back in. Walked around my desk. I opened my desk drawer and brought
177 out a blank file. I dropped it on the desk top and opened it. She was settling
178 into her chair as I got a pen and sat down.
179  
180     She smiled politely. She began to speak and choked on her words. She lost
181 her composure then. Her eyebrows clenched together tightly, and she bit her
182 lip. She regained her composure again and smiled politely.

195  
196 	Sears trade center towers.  Standing on an infirm base of a
197 concrete block, it spires into the Chicago skyline.  Creating a navigation
198 problem for overpassing traffic.  Solving the problem with the electrical
199 aid of lights at the corners of the roof.  Reflecting the lights of the
200 Financial District below.
201  
202 	On the streets, men in suits dash for corporate offices.  Parcels
203 in their pockets, and folders in their briefcases plot the rise and fall
204 of their profits.  Shown on graphs looking like the skyline of the great
205 city of Chicago itself.  Each of them with enough information to topple an
206 entire concern of a thousand investors.
207  
208 	In this world, the god is finance.
209  
210 	In among the hustle is a tall man with a loosened tie and thin
211 rimmed glasses.  He is paying a cabbie as we enter into the scene.  We
212 might notice but neither of them did, that he just accidentally passed a
213 counterfeit ten spot.  Pawns often do such things.  Corporate pawns never
214 notice.
215  
216 	He strolls to a garden slowly.  Street traffic passes each other
217 in an ever accelerating attempt to get there sooner.  Suits and skirts
218 pass into and out of doors within every second.  Still, he simply wanders
219 over to the place where he wants to sit and does.  Adjusting his glasses,
220 he pauses a moment to look at the parcel he carries.
221  
222 	It is a large cardboard box with the name of a corporation stamped
223 on the side.  A computer.  A portable computer.  It is the sort that acts
224 as a book would.  In and out of briefcases, with data and methods of
225 showing it.  Never needing to stop long enough to be set into a wall
226 socket.  He removes the computer from the box and sets it down.
227  
228 	After reading the manuals and pushing his glasses back along his
229 nose, he places the batteries within it and turns it on.  A serene display
230 of silent letters and symbols appears on the screen.  With every task the
231 new owner gives it, they dance and skitter as if in a dance.  Soon after
232 one task is ordered, the lines halt their motions, and a tone erupts out
233 of the computer for the first time.
234  
235 	We are listening to it dialing a telephone.  Telephones are
236 carried in briefcases, and carted around from place to place.  To dial one
237 of them, a person would simply need to pick up the receiver and tap a few
238 keys.  It is all the more complex for a computer.  It pretends to be a
239 part of the telephone and acts as if those keys had been tapped.  Which
240 produces the same result.
241  
242 	The phone is answered.  Our slim friend listens to the computer as
243 if it was the only noise in the garden.  Waiting to hear if a person, or
244 another computer has answered.  Traffic noises, emergency sirens, and the
245 din of so many hushed conversations are forgotten.  The sound that comes
246 across is a static tone.  The twin computers speaking in a sort of Morse
247 Code.
248  
249 	Our friend smiles.
250  
251 	Elsewhere, that same call has just arrived.  Routine.  This place
252 gets many such calls.  Day in, and day out.  It is a room dedicated to the
253 operation of a computer.  Fans whir.  Taking the heat from the active
254 electronics and blowing it into a vent and away.  Lights blip on and off,
255 with each letter or symbol sent or received from this communications
256 center.
257  
258 	A hunched over man appears from behind one of the lockers that
259 holds parts of the computer.  He is old.  Perhaps seventy, most likely a
260 decade older.  His eyes seem to perceive each component around him.  To
261 understand them.  To be able to use them best.
262  
263 	At the garden, our friend uses predetermined numbers.  He learns
264 the use of the computers the elder man fosters.  The numbers allow him to
265 read the stories, discussions, and debates which prosper in the revolution
266 of the communications center.  A revolution that might have changed
267 Chicago, and the corporate world.
268  
269 	All of which is academic.  Since as our friend lifts his eyes from
270 the gray display of his portable computer, he finds himself in the
271 fantastic world of one of those stories.

276    I am a pilot for a corporate executive. My name is Red. His name is Wesley.
277 He doesn't fly many places, but about once a month, after he gets his pay
278 check, we go out on a little mission of our own.
279    He has a lot of money. And I'd say that check of his comes out to be about
280 how much money the average white family makes in thirty years. He says he has
281 this trick worked out where unions accept these huge pay reductions and he
282 just gives himself bonuses in his paycheck that make up for it. Quite a man,
283 mister Wesley.
284    Anyway, he bought this custom helicopter from Bell Aerospace Group. It does
285 enough to make a pilot piss on a high power line, but a lot of it is technical
286 and I couldn't explain it to an audience like this. Who knows how many dregs
287 of society and welfare recipients are reading this. All you need to know is
288 that I can hover over an alley like a harvest moon. Aside from the controls,
289 we have twin cannon mount on the nose of the aircraft, nine sleek heat seeking
290 missiles tuned to body temperature, and a port for dropping three pointed
291 stars on the ground to prevent our prey from running where we don't want them
292 to run.
293    See, we hunt down vagrants and the homeless.
294    About the third of every month, we take off from the U. S. Bancorp tower
295 heliport, and cross over to the east bank. We use a special arrangement of
296 mufflers to keep anyone from reporting us to the FAA. Our blades are about the
297 only thing you can hear as we hover over the river, and hell, they're fatal
298 too.
299    Balony Joe's is over on the east part of the Burnside bridge. A lot of
300 alkies fester over there. The train tracks and embankments of the river make
301 good places to isolate one of those useless bastards. Using infrared
302 enhancement gear, I can project a picture of the son of a bitch on my helmet
303 shield. Then the cannon can take care of them. Either that or a hand gun fired
304 all sharpshooter like by Mister Wesley. Sometimes he likes that. One of them
305 alkies just stumbles down on the wet asphalt and just can't get up, well he
306 just goes over and blows them away. He said once that he was just trying to do
307 his bit for natural selection.
308    I sure respect Mister Wesley. He might be old, but at least he knows what's
309 right. One time I remember real well, he was sure that one old alcoholic was
310 trying to piss off the Steel Bridge. He got the hoods off the missile racks
311 and put some explosive tipped shells in the magazines for the cannon. We were
312 going to run him along the light rail route a while until he nearly escaped
313 into the tangle of streets that end off the steel bridge. First, we were gonna
314 make him pay his debt to society.
315    He looked over and saw this machine hanging in the air off the bridge, and
316 I'll swear his piss turned green. He tried to put the bag down at his feet on
317 his shoulder, but the twine snapped. Dumb alkies. Why didn't he get a job and
318 buy one like a man? He wouldn't be needing the bed roll anymore anyway. He
319 started running down the bridge, his clothes just coming off in the frezzing
320 wind. I lifted the machine about twenty feet so's we'd clear the bridge, and
321 the turned down the rails after him.
322    When he got the end of the bridge, he knew we were after him. Somewhere in
323 that puny inferior mind, he knew he was dead. I let off a few rounds into the
324 cement right next to the alky. He looked off one way, but he didn't run. Lucky
325 for him, cause I let another squeeze of my trigger put a few bullets right
326 where he would have run. He looked right behind him, I could tell because his
327 shining face went dark for a second, and his hair went wild in the wind and
328 our searchlight. The sign behind was done in red and wite, it warned about the
329 wires for the light rail. This is where his inferior strain shows through. He
330 put his fingers in the links and tried to climb the thing. I could almost hear
331 the chain links noise through the door opened on the side of the chopper,
332 Mister Wesley was stepping out onto the missile racks.
333    The guy got to the top of the fence. I saw his hands were bloody from the
334 desperate scramble. But he was dead almost as soon as I looked up. Wesley had
335 given him a few grams of German metal right to the scalp. I saw him fall, that
336 was about it. The electrical sparks and flashes shone blue through the
337 windshield and lit up the craft just as Wesley got back in and shut the door.
338 He knew the old alky had landed on the high power electric cables the fed the
339 light rail. Boy, what an investment that turned out to be.
340    We did some coke on the way back to the tower. But not before a few other
341 killings out on Sauvie's Island. Boy, we got a first class set-up here. What's
342 even better, no one misses the old alkies anyway. By, oh boy, you know, the
343 third of the month is coming up awful quick and a train just got in from Los
344 Angeles with a bunch of alkies hidden on it. This is gonna be better than when
345 the Neeshies brought vagrants into the state.
346    See you around. By the way, do you have a job?

370 The time had come for him to leave the Inn.  Time passed slowly here,
371 but quickly in the parallel realm to which he would soon return.  He
372 looked about him, savoring the images of this place of prose and poetry.
373      Sighing, he stood and placed his robes upon his shoulders.  He
374 addressed those seated about him: "Well, my friends, the time has come
375 for me to take my leave.  If the Fates smile upon my ventures, I should
376 be returning again soon.  If not...  But whatever the future holds, I
377 bid you all farewell!"
378      He walked slowly towards the door.  When he reached it, he turned
379 and looked about the Inn once more.  He turned again to the door.  He
380 opened it, strode out, and closed it softly behind him.
381      He walked down the path, watching the strange patterns in the
382 clouds above.  As he got farther down the path, his form became more
383 insubstantial until he simply disappeared into the mist...

400 "we have another jumper going at it", said Angelica. 
401     Sam looked up from the big board, focusing on Angelica's slim form bent 
402 over the time tracer. 
403     "Where is he located?"
404     "In Old New York, in the 45th quad. Sixteen feet underground, and he is
405 jumping back 24 years in time. 
406    Sam got up and walked over to the graphic plotter. "Pull it up on the 
407 computer,"
408    A moment of silence and then the plotter ratteled into life, sketching the 
409 quad and surrounding building floor diagrams, based on information in the local
410 city land use planning files. In a few minutes it finished, then started over 
411 again as Sam slipped a sheet of Mylar into the plotter. This time, it sketched 
412 the plans, as they were 24 years earlier, with the differing floor plans
413 superimposed over the current plan. The plans were much more sketchy, with 
414 gaps and spaces here and there, but there was still enough detail for sam to
415 make out the time jumpers intent.
416     "oh ho, it looks like he is intending to end up in the middle of a bank
417 vault, do you think he is going to make change?"
418      Angelica laughed, "he's probably going to empty the vault, Sam."
419    "I know. What a crime, the bank officials leave the days take in the safe 
420 at night, then next morning look in and suprise, it's gone.  Impossible to 
421 trace any of the cash, because by the time it goes into circulation, the
422 original bank has failed, and nobody cares.  I think this one deserves a special
423 treatment.   Find out when he arrives back in our time."
424     Angelica frowned. "According to the records, he jumps forward six months
425 ahead of departure. That is highly unusual, since in theory, it makes it 
426 easier to arrest him."
427      "Maybe h thinks it will be easier to hide in the future, than the past. 
428 I'll notify the local police, let them bother with this one"

431 The INN seemed full again with story tellers galore, each with his own taste of
432 life. Some orated in the present, others in the future. Some even spoke of tales
433 in the Netherworlds. It was good to be back among those who minds did not 
434 stagnate but kept alive the adventures of life.
435 THOR put both hands around the stein of ale and thought of the time he had lost
436 being away from the INN and fretted a bit. For here at the place he enjoyed
437 being provided him with the escape he so much needed from the world he was
438 forced to exist within. A world where so many decisions were being made with a
439 computer and not with human companssion.
440 Sometimes pure reason was not enough to make the world coexist, sometimes it
441 was the absolute insanity that made it a place where peoples future depended
442 solely on the roll of chance.
443 THOR shook his head and thought to himself what a carnival of fools controlled
444 so many lives in their insane desire to
445 change what was not theirs to change.
446 So many had lost so much for so little excuse. Why must they suffer because 
447 their attitudes were not atuned to those with the power and money?
448 A foolish question thought THOR to himself, as he had seen the consequences so
449 many times throughout his existance for not bending with the terrible wind that
450 traveled across the earth.
451 Enough philosophying, time for another sip of ale and a listen to another 
452 teller of tales.

463 	"Tad, this is not enough," Our friend hid behind a mossy log as
464 the two theives fought over their split.  He had been sitting on a
465 concrete bench and was deposited in this forest quite suddenly.  He struck
466 the ground on his back before he even noticed a shift his surroundings or
467 even in his balance.  He lost consciousness then.  As he later awoke,
468 these two thieves were differing around a tree.
469  
470 	One thief was lacing up a boot.  He sat in a patch of streaming
471 sunlight.  On the same fallen log as our friend had been deposited on.
472 Down the length of it about thirty feet.  As his friend spoke of the
473 disparity in their earnings, he slid a long burnt dagger out from the sole
474 of his boot.  It had stains of being held over a flame enough to have been
475 blackened, so thought our friend, thinking on his feet, wondering whether
476 he was going to see a death or not.  Not considering how he had gotten
477 there.
478  
479 	"Fair share!" His raised tone betrayed how alone he thought they
480 were in the woods.  Tad put the dagger under the weight of his boot and
481 rested his crossed arms and firm chin on his knee.  The dagger would be
482 there if he needed it, surmised our friend dressed in nylon.  "Can I help
483 it if I found more than you? Do you deserve that which you did not steal?
484 Am I to give you the results of my search? That is absurd!"
485  
486 	"No, wait, you offered me a fair share.  Nobody steals from me,
487 not you," It was as if he was going to protest further.  Then he knelt
488 slowly, and dropped to the leaves and dirt at his feet.  Tad was wiping
489 the red stains and the char off the dagger even as our friend decided the
490 other was dead.  It was then that the sweat started to collect on the skin
491 of our friend.  Weighing whether or not this thief would discover him.  So
492 he stayed in his laid down position.  Not daring to turn away or stand to
493 run.
494  
495 	The body was searched, and covered in leaves.  Tad had not found
496 even a trinket on his former associate.  A wristlet of no value.  A length
497 of cloth, stuck through with needles of varying width.  Perhaps those two
498 items were worthful, if soley because they were the only possessions of
499 the deceased.  Whatever the value of that was, it was summarily ignored by
500 the quick working thief who had dealt and done away with him.
501  
502 	"Brother, rejoice in ecstacy, for I regret your pains," These
503 words were spoken swifty and in a single tone.  As if they were nothing
504 more than a colloquial saying for the dead.
505  
506 	A thing they might have been, but an idea that never entered the
507 frantic theories of the one who was hiding behind a fallen tree.  His
508 limbs were still.  His head only shook as he watched the distant thief in
509 action.  And his hands were clasped together as if they would try to push
510 him up and with the conspiracy of his legs, send him off on a bolt away
511 from this place.  He tried just to lay still.
512  
513 	Tad was not overjoyed.  Neglecting the body at his feet, he looked
514 around and rubbed his hands swiftly together.  It was plain that he had
515 not planned a way out of the forest.  The cold mist of the forest was
516 sapping away from the nervous heat that went with the deed.  To start a
517 fire, he gathered up a few dead branches.  Eventually he leapt over the
518 fallen log.  Not noticing the nylon jacket or the prone form of our
519 friend.  Crossing the forest floor about thirty feet, he started the blaze.

524 om the INN would be a cold one, thought THOR as he pulled his hooded robe
525 over his weathered brow and cinched the belt tighter to keep out the early
526 mornings bite. It was beyond late, almost the time when the night is its
527 darkest and is at its quietus. THOR could hear his own footsteps echoing 
528 against the stone walls of the adjacent building as he made his way home. His
529 cadence bore a military beat and memories of the days he spent in them came back
530 to him giving him a melancholy feeling. The walking dream was quickly broken as 
531 he heard voices ahead in the direction that he was destined.
532 The voices were young but not juvenile. They rose and fell in tempo with each 
533 other as if a contest of words and volume were the point of the conversation.
534 The night mist still camouflaged their forms but THOR could tell that they were
535 getting closer and closer as he could
536 understand more and more of what was being said. It was obvious that there were
537 at least three persons involved in the clamour and they were now yelping like
538 puppies being beaten with a switch.
539 The voices gave traces of intoxication as the words that were said were slurred
540 sometimes beyond recognition.
541 When they were twenty paces from THOR he could see their forms and they his.
542 A howl rang out from the smallest of the group and he ran forward ahead of the
543 others to within an arms reach of THOR.
544 "Hey guy, guess what I just found?", yelled back the young drunken face towards
545 his comrades.
546 "You're not going to believe this but O Bee One Kunobe LIVES!!!" 
547 And with this statement came a laaugh akin to a jackel leading a Hyena pack.
548 THOR had stopped walking and was looking around for a route that would take him
549 away from these drunken fools. But as he stepped off of the sidewalk to make his 
550 way across to the other side of the street, the tormentor jumped quickly in 
551 front of him in a jester to herd him back onto the sidewalk.
552 "Come on Old JEDI, where's that stupid flashlight you use to take off peoples
553 arms with?"
554 The tormentor then grabbed down around THORS people as if to be looking for the
555 object asked about. THOR grabbed the 
556 young mans wrists and forced them outward and asked,"Knock it off son while I
557 still have the patience to ignore you."
558 "Whoa...what do we have here...come on guys O-B-One wants to duel." With this
559 the other two men arrived on the scene and began laughing when they saw what
560 their comrade had been talking about. "Hey this guy is really gnarly, look at
561 that disguise." The largest of the three
562 had shown his interest in THOR's robe and reached out to grab at the belt that
563 was tightly bound around THOR's waist.
564 THOR instinctively grabbed the young mans wrist in a defensive manner and did
565 not realize the strength that he was using to do so. 
566 "K-E-E-E-Y--R-I-G-H-S-T....let go of me old man, you're breaking my frickin
567 wrist." With this scream THOR let loose the lamenting victim and stepped back
568 a step from the remaining two men.
569 "The dirty old bastard broke my wrist, kill the old fool he's a menace!"
570 The two young men looked at THOR and noted his apparent retreat backwards as he
571 had stepped away from them. They 
572 mistook rTHOR's movement unfortunately as THOR merely stepped backward so as to 
573 brace himself against an attack.
574 The least talkative man made the first lomove towards THOR and found himself 
575 skidding face down on the abrasive cement sidewalk. THOR had taken the man by
576 his outstretched arm and had pulted him
577 on past where THOR was standing, onto the sidewalk where he moaned but once 
578 before slipping into slumberland.
579 "What are you anyway," cried out the original jackel, "You some retired old 
580 wrestler or something?"
581 THOR looked at the two remaining men, one holding his wrist and the other just
582 staring in disbelief and spoke,
583 "Yea, I'm a retired or something."
584 And with this THOR went on his way leaving behind three who maybe, just maybe
585 might not make fun of the next person
586 they meet after a night of merrymaking.

592 I want to say something. It is something poignant, weighing on me. To do with
593 this song, or these songs, that the radio has been playing. More to do with
594 what the others times were, that I was listening to these songs. No matter. I
595 am going to go reminisce on those times, before I go to work on this

607 greetings THOR:  Long time, no see.
608 I have not been doing to much writing on-line due to it being 
609 required of me in school.  Do you still work at the little 
610 store?  I tried calling you there a few months ago, just a
611 little hello from,
612 *************************kathyD**********************************
613 p.s.  Just thought Id fill up a couple more lines, sort of like 
614 when PAM would clean up in days of past.  I kinda liked the 
615 twisted little story about the bum blaster in the helecopter.
616 brought a funny little grin to my face.  Bard's song was very
617 entertaining too.  And who else did we see this weekend?  None
618 other than the MAD MAX.  It's fun to take a look in the olde
619 INN and see familar faces.  I think Ill have another OREO and
620 dream about days gone by.
