21 After what seemed like eons, I finally found myself on top of a small knoll.
22 There below in a small depression was a strange looking box sitting just
23 slightly above the ground. #That's it! That's it!# cried a voice in my
24 head. "What's it?" I responded. #That's the transport. That's our ticket
25 off this ball of bleach.# "What's a ticket?" #Never mind, let's just get
26 down there before they decide to take off.# Within a short period of time
27 I was standing beside the box. Not being able to figure out anything else,
28 I rapped my knuckles against what appeared to be the doorway to the thing.
29 "Ahem.. Hey! Anybody home?"
30 ############################ The Innkeeper ###############################
31 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\44
32    James was weary beyond words. Careless of the energy he had expended, he had come a thousand miles over, around, or
33 through every obstacle to this place. At night, when he could sleep, he saw Tariya's face and little else. He no
34 longer cared if he lived or died. All he wanted to accomplish in this life now was the destruction of the council and
35 the safety of Tariya's family, however little they deserved it.
36    He stood on one of the yard-thick beams that made the ceiling supports in the main council hall. Below, totally
37 unsuspecting, were the remaining members of the circle. The only piece of furniture in the room was a large "C" shaped
38 table with twelve chairs on the outside. Nine of those chairs were occupied, three were empty. He had seen to two of
39 those vacencies himself. There were a couple of assistants there, but no guards. The security in this place sucked.
40 Those who dabbled in magic a lot tended to rely on it to protect themselves. In his case, it wasn't enough.
41    Listening carefully, he heard them discussing the fact that they had been invaded. It was about frigging time they
42 noticed. it was also time he gave them something else to notice. He stepped off the beam.
43    It was a forty foot drop to the floor. James landed feet first, flagstones shattering under his shoes. They were
44 startled, but not exactly panicked. The simply stared at him until he began to feel a little embarassed. Finally, he
45 said, "Hi."
46    At the center of the table was an immensely old man, dressed in finer robes than the rest (which was saying a lot)
47 He stodd stiffly and addressed James. "You are the intruder that has killed two of our number this night?"
48    Was this guy kidding? "No, I'm your Fuller Brush man."
49    He either ignored or didn't understand the sarcasm. "What is your business here?"
50    "I want the war stopped."
51    A fat woman at the far end of the table jumped up. "You can't be serious! By what power do you intend to enforce
52 your demands?"
53    James smiled evilly, "Oh, I'm so glad you asked." He raised a fist, which was wreathed in blue fire. A dozen bolts
54 shot from it to the woman. There were a series of flashes and loud esplosions. He lowered his hand, but when the smoke
55 cleared he saw that her section of the table had been reduced to burning kindling but she herself stood unharmed, if
56 startled. James spun around and looked sharply at the old man. Somehow, he had protected her.
57    "You might have suceeded had you continued with your geurilla tactics rather than confronting us openly. There is
58 power in numbers. Allow me to demonstrate..."
59    The other eight had seemed to have gone in a trance. James could feel the power in the room shift and flow to the
60 old man. He summoned the sword, raising it before him. No blue fire raced along its edge this time.
61    The old man shimmered and suddenly became a black outline. The outling grew until it attained the size and
62 musculature of the Hulk. Looking hard, James could make out tiny points of light within it, like stars. The giant took
63 several steps forward, the table shattering before it. It reached out for him and James whipped the sword through its
64 arm.
65    It was like cutting air. The blade passed through without effect. A large black hand clamped hard on the front of
66 his jacket and raised him into the air. James struggled, but he couldn't touch the giant, even though it could
67 definitely touch him. He found himself looking into the void where the face should have been.
68    The old man's voice echoed ghost-like out of that void. "There is power in numbers. We knew you would confront us
69 openly. We were prepared. For the deaths of our comrades, and the danger you represent, you must now die."
70    James had just time to register these words before the giant smashed him senseless against the stone
71 floor.

120 #Nulinta remul pok, nulinta remul pok, nulinta remul pok...# thought Milchar,
121 working himself into a trance in which his recall of Heal lore he had studied
122 would be at its best.  His repertoire of spells of that nature was
123 distressingly small, so little time was wasted choosing.
124 Themage carefully checked his body, to see if it would be damaged while he
125 was gone.  After he had been satisfied (a second or so later) he released his
126 soul-self to cmore closely inspect the damage.
127 Massive damage to both lungs was clear.  The atmosphere outside had taken its
128 toll on tPiper, who had not reached protection in time.  Milchar's soul-self
129 sent little tendrils of thought to explore briefly the rest of Piper's body,
130 stopping when nothing abnormal was found.
131 The soul-self turned its attention to the lungs, and as it did it felt the
132 slightest hint of cold.  It knew, suddenly, that Bard had taken care of what
133 wsas left of the little flames on Milchar's robe, and that the body would feel
134 very cold when it returned.  It hoped that the body could adjust by itself.
135 The soul-self shrunk itself, becoming but a point within the lungs; there it
136 began to dance.
137 The mote hopped left and dodged right, healing as it moved, in a complex rhythm.
138 A clot here destroyed, hop, dodge, jump, spin, a break repaired.  Spin, hop,
139 dodge, constantly moving, dancing to a music not heard by mortals.

142 While the turkey who entered the Celestial bbs message demonstrated his
143 intelligence for all to see, I'd agree that this bbs, if it is as described,
144 is a whale of a lot better than 95% of Commodore bbs's around.  MOST such
145 bbs's only have a 300 baud modem, have no hard disk, and are as slow
146 as molasses in January.  (has anyone out there ever SEEN molasses in January?)
147   A bbs might be looked at as a generous offer by a person to allow many others
148 to use his computer for their benefit.  Of course, depending on the computer,
149 it could also be interpreted as an attempt by the sysop to inflict his
150 computer on the public.  We'll see...

153 Milch: Congrats to you for your excellent showing in the corewars game!  At
154   these events, it can be rather embarrasing to have some highschool hackers
155   beat out the "educated and practiced" college hackers.  As for Impus, I
156   must admit that I just took it right out of the original Scientific
157   American (I think that's where it came from) article.  Maybe I'll put a
158   little more thought into it next year...  Sorry 'bout my not connecting

188 Washington, January 12
189 The new Director stood from his chair.  Steadilyhe depressed a 
190 thin red key into the shiny desk surface.  A moitor rose from
191 the black top and a keyboard clicked up also.   secretary 
192 entered the office.  If the new Director had notbeen 
193 preplexed, he might have noticed.
194 
195 "An appointement, Director."
196 "What?  Oh, right."
197 "Should I get rid of them, Director?"
198 He depressed another slim red key and a graphic f the world 
199 showed on the table top.  Sattelite charts, oceaographs and 
200 aeronautical maps were overlaid there.  Pressingkeys, it all 
201 disappeared in an instant.
202 "Director?"
203 "Sorry.  Please send them in."
204 
205 The monitor and keyboard submerged into the deskas the two men 
206 entered.  A stenographer followed and sat discreely near the 
207 new Director.  She prepared her pad while the thee men shook 
208 each others hands.
209 
210 "Sit down, gentlemen."
211 One of the men lumbered into a chair.  The othersat down 
212 gingerly, and made himself comfortable at last. Neither knew 
213 what to say first.
214 "Now, explain the McKane account."
215 The obeise one decided to speak first.  As he sarted talking, 
216 the other one interupted loudly.
217 "The Agency owes him.  When congress denied us apart of the 
218 1983 budget, he- donated it."
219 
220 The Director frowned.
221 "We took him into the Alps after the last engageent with the 
222 Net.  The ass nailed us.  He threatened full dislosure to 
223 Conress about fiscal 1983."
224 
225 "Disperse the McKane organization."
226 "If he sends fiscal 1983 to Congress?"
227 "Adopt Delta Five."
228 
229 The Director was ruthless.  Senators Duncan and mithfield 
230 promised support for the Agency as long as Hart ot information 
231 on the Presidency.  President Reagan was easilydeveived anyway.
232 
233 The Agency was his.

236 The Swiss Alps, January 15
237 Nichols opened the door and watched it fall away  Oaken bars 
238 and brass rails rested behind it and the smell o musty cigars 
239 flooded out through the door.  Nichols caughed ad entered the 
240 room to find the man puffing on a dark roll of tbacco.
241 
242 "Mister McKane?"
243 The man was behind a thick cloud and was lookingover an 
244 imported newspaper.  He removed his spectacles nd puffed again 
245 at Nichols.
246 "Are you well?"
247 The man skoffed at the question and addressed hiself to the 
248 newspaper.  Adjusting his spectacles and inhalin deeply.
249 
250 "I'm sorry."
251 The man looked out of his lenses and through thesmoke at 
252 Nichols.  The shot rang through the corridors an echoed 
253 through the alps.
254 "It was orders from Washington."
255 
256 Maine, January 21
257 Philips tucked his clipboard under one arm and laced his 
258 pencils in his teeth.  He slowly turned two larg knobs and 
259 then paced the room to check the tuning.
260 Ian entered and assumed a waiting posture as Phiips adjusted 
261 the radios.  Eventually his patience ran out an he spoke.
262 
263 "So, what have you found?"
264 Philips ignored Ian and snapped a long rod into  wall of 
265 electronics and told him to listen.
266 
267 "McKane Trust Foundation filed for chapter twele bankruptcy 
268 today, after the Internal Revenue Service annou-
269 
270 "Tennesee Irradiation Technology, a division ofMcKane

275 Multinational is not a church and therefore looss tax exempt 
276 status.  Shareholders are expe-"
277 
278 "The government is shutting down McKane."
279 Philips then waited for praise at his findings. Disappointed 
280 at not getting any, he began to chatter about th conspiracy.
281 "It is the government.  Only they have the powerto dissemble 
282 the organization without troubles."
283 
284 Ian left.  Philips was a fool.  Now the point wa not to rid 
285 the world of McKane but to keep it free from hi ilk.

345   Unconciousness comes in many forms.  There is the sweet bliss of sleep, 
346 restful, healing.  There is the sweaty unconciousness of troubled sleep,
347 tossing, turning.  There is the unknowing blackness of coma, drugged with the
348 unhealthy tinge of approaching death.  Sometimes there is more.  Sometimes
349 there is a conciousness beyond the body, knowlege that passes by what could
350 normally be known.
351   The piper seemed to be watching a scene from high above.  Figures moved and
352 changed, working around another.  Smoke billowed from a robe, blasts of cold
353 extinguished flame.  That essence that was the piper watched, bemused, not
354 understanding, drifting without volition, seeing without recognition.
355   Names drifted to him where he floated near the ceiling of the transport.
356 Milchar.  Cragmore.  Bard.  Names that he knew but could not recognize.
357 Somehow he felt deep sorrow for the tiny figures that moved so far below him,
358 dancing around the damaged one that he saw, nearly feeling the damage, avoiding
359 staying away from the damage.
360   Drifting higher, he penetrated the ceiling of the vehicle, floating through
361 the metals and plastics that protected the fragile life within.  Higher, to
362 see another figure moving toward the vehicle, hearing the pounding on the
363 entrance, the plea for admittance, bobbing like a kite on a silver cord.
364   Suddenly, like a kite reeled from its dance in the sky, he was pulled,
365 snatched by the pull of the cord, spinning dizzily into the scene below.

368 Agency:Indeed interesting, considering that much of the entry was almost verbatim from another entry seen here a few
369 months ago. The ending of your entry is different, but the major portion of the action has already been written before.
370 One can only hope that you were the one who wrote the previous entry, otherwise you are a plagerizer, one of the most
371 detested species here on Backwater. Since the original entry was shunned by the rest of the NET writers when it was
372 first entered, this latest upload is definitely a case of two wrongs making a bigger wrong. Do you possibly think that
373 the U.S. goverment could do anything to really hurt McKane enterprises? Can you actually write an entry that finds Ian
374 in the field, a location always delegated to his agents, but not himself? And you think that the great Leroy McKane
375 could actually be felled by a simple assasin with a gun? No sir, things do not come easy in this world. Great
376 accomplishments require hard work. If things were easy, nothing would have any value. The agency must be a fraud
377 perpetrated by some new organization striving to make a place for itself by fooling the unsuspecting masses with
378 misinformation. Reader beware.

421      "Cragmore! I don't know what sort of culture you are from but I'm not
422 about to let Piper die on your say so." said bard as he eased milchar onto 
423 the other bunk.
424      "First we'll heal him and then we'll see what he thinks. Suicide is...
425 <THUMP><THUMP>
426      Bard was interrupted by a sound from the hatch. Looking thru a port he
427 saw the Innkeeper. But he didn't see any trace of a protective spell/field/
428 ANYTHING! 
429     "Cragmore. There's something out there. It looks like the Innkeeper...
430 *but it's breathing the local air*! I'm going to let it in but I need you 
431 tell me if it really is him..."
432      He pressed a button and the outer hatch opened. Bard and Cragmore both
433 peering thru the port at ... the Innkeeper?
434 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
435 Ok, Kathyd & Cragmore seem to think that Piper wants to die. I don't and
436 in fact I think it would be better to ask *him*! But that is a minor point.
437 They seem to think that if he wants to die *WE SHOULD LET HIM*!!!????
438 Say What? Care to explain yourselves? And remember, while this is a story
439 someone out there *might* try applying your answers to real life. 
440 Do you want some confused kid's suicide on your conscience? I imagine
441 everyone has *thought* about suicide at some time, but that doesn't make
442 it right. No matter what your beliefs are, it doesn't really solve anything
443 does it?

446 Well, what you say about suicide not solving anything is not true. Euthanasia
447 is suicide, and it solves something-a life that is naught but pain...
448 In some cases, one person killing themself solves another persons problems.
449 But don't take my word for it, try it yourself and see.

452 Hey...it's still here.  Thank god some things remain, like BWMS.
453 Tomorrow (Wednesday) is my 21st birthday, and now I start the
454 downhill slide to 30.  **sigh**  
455 ........................................Entropy.................
456 `,`,`Don't think of it as sliding downhill. You have only begun to live!`,`,`
457 
458 If you are on the downhill slide TO 30, what does that make those of us already
459 BEYOND 30?  Don't answer that, I'm afraid I already know.
460 
461 .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
462 For those of os on the downhill slide, it's gotta be easier than that uphill
463   climb from infancy, through puberty <gads, what a mess that was!> and into
464   our first drinks, first (and last, we hope) drugs, and on into the twenties,
465   finally considered a fullfledged member of our society.  Frankly, I'm
466   enjoying my slide.  Soon it will become a slide of an amusement park, taking
467   the twists into matrimony, maybe I'll be lucky enough to be a father!  The
468   way I figure it, the thirties offer a time for me to look back at my "youth"
469   and yet stay young by showing my future children the tricks to enjoying
470   life.  Why should the number 30 be such a big deal?  I can't wait!
471 .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.EmuPhilosophy

474 Life begins at forty. Yeah, I know- you young pups think that that philosophy is the semi-coherent ramblings of the
475 "older set" Well, it really is true. One loses some of the things that characterize the twenties and tirties, the 
476 new experiences, the "Hey, wow, uh I mean like I'm *old enough now*...
477    So, you do all the things that young people do. You get drunk a few clandestine times, get in a fistfight or two
478 go the drug trip, and get laid now and then... And you start to get cocky. "I know..." Well, you don't know. Not yet.
479 Wait till you hit the big 40. Downhill? Not at all.It is *often* that one finally realizes his destiny in his forties.
480 Life does indeed begin at forty. 
481 I can hear Morrissey now-"god no one is *that* old.One realizes their weaknesses and their strengths, and begins to 
482 plan accordingly. 
483 A very wise man once said -"One can not know the meaning of life untill they have accepted the inevitability of death.
484 One can not know light without knowing darkness, for all of being is contrast.
485 Ah, you young pups, you have the best part coming. You may be 'fortunate' in bringing new life into the world. You 
486 may also be coherent enough to percieve the ramifications of such an act- it will cost you a hundred thousand dollars
487 to raise and educate that bundle of joy. That will buy a lot of things.
488 Reminds me of the advise of a trusted friend-"If you are married, you have a set of problems. If you are single, you
489 have a set of problems"
490 Pick your set of problems..."
491 
492         IT'S AGAINST THE LAW....
493 In Sheboygan Wisconsin, it is a crime (punishable by fine or imprisonment) to have sex with a person you are not married
494 to. In Portland, you can not purchase and take home a handgun without breaking the law.
495 In New Jersey, it is against the law to dispose of a dead body in any lake, river, or other *body* of water. In Kentucky
496 a woman can not hitch-hike while wearing a bathing suit unless she carries a club. In Louisiana, you can be sentenced
497 to death in the electric chair for selling pot. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, it is against the law to own an Elephant. 
498 In Arizona, it is a crime to kick ( Yes "kick") a cactus. In Alaska, it is a crime to refuse to stop and offer assistanc
499 e to a stranded motorist. In Tyler, Texas, it is against the law for three people to occupy a hotel/motel room, since
500 two of those people will have to be of the same sex.(Guess the city council never heard of San Francisco) In a suburb
501 of Clearwater, Florida - if you have a Pit Bull, you must have a six foot chain link fence to contain said vicious
502 animal. And in Sacremento, Ca., you can not own a Boa Constrictor. "The law is of, and for (?) the people.

508      In a seldom used meeting chamber, agents from around the nation have
509 been gathered for a dismal meeting with the leader of their organization.
510 Few look forward to ever hearing words directly from the top, this is no
511 exception.
512      
513      "Are all the agents I requested present?" asks Ian MacHinery of his
514 new assistant.
515      "All that we were able to contact and retrieve on such short notice,"
516 she responds.  He only turns his head and glares at her.  "...Sir," she
517 adds in haste.  She busily looks over her list of members in the field and
518 of those present.  Ian continues.
519      "I have brought you together for a special reason."  A slight
520 muttering is heard in the dimmly lit room.  "I thought it was about time
521 that I spoke to you all as one."  He begins to feel the mounting tension
522 within the room. "Well, I suppose this will have to do."   Prepared as Ian
523 attempts to make himself, he still fidgets with his scripts, never truly
524 prepared.
525      "Miss Lovelace, I need the the files."  Ada hands them over and
526 returns to her seat.  Ian says nothing.  Ms. Nomer still looks through her
527 lists. Then Ian begins to make a slight roll call of the agents he had
528 specifically requested be present.  He makes his first call.
529      "Agent Joshua..."  There is no reply.  You'd have to tie this one down
530 and drag him into one of these meetings unless something big was about to
531 go down.  Joshua knew otherwise and was believed to have driven off for
532 another visit to Nirvana.  Better luck next time Mr. MacHinery.
533      "Agent Gaudy Misky..."  He received the same reply, nothing.  Agent
534 Minsky had been going through some extensive training in a diversified
535 range of affairs to prepare herself for her next encounter with a nemesis
536 that had once been her partner -- Agent Fleming.
537      "Agent Fellows..."
538      "Sir,..." replied Ms. Nomer.  "Agents Fellows and Parity are still in
539 Alaska taking care of the Delta Five situation.  They wouldn't respond to
540 any of the calls we sent via comlink..."  Ian heard Ms. Nomer's account and
541 carried on.
542      "Agent Eugene Farley..."  Again nothing.  It was beginning to dawn on
543 the great Mr. MacHinery that his regime was not so well within his grasp as
544 had pretended it to be.  He mopped the sweat from his brow.
545      "Agent Charmichael..."  It was a longs-shot, but still he tried.
546 Charmichael had been on duty not too far from the current location of NET
547 headquarters and Ian thought he would at least have one man available.
548      "Hmm, we have this one taken care of...  No need, at present, to
549 reinstate his license," he said under his breath.  He gave a small cough
550 and dabbed again at his forehead.
551      "Agent Fleming..."  That was a mistake.  Having mentioned that name in
552 league with the rest he finally realized he was more fatigued than he had
553 imagined.  Agent Fleming was a rougue operative, obeying no one's commands
554 other than his own.  Agent Minsky had been dedicating herself to the day
555 she would be able to return him to NET, she was ready to do so be it a
556 captive or a corpse.  But Fleming was, of course, nowhere to be found.
557      
558      Undaunted by the absence of the major operatives, Ian continued with
559 the disclosures of his originally intended speech.  A few would fall
560 asleep, fewer still would be effected by his words...
561      
562 00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  00%  [00%]  00%  00%

568 The mist rose so a man could be seen, he held a clipboard in his right hand
569 a quill in his left.   Behind him a winged horse nickered softly, shaking
570 her mane and pawing her foot.
571 The man turned to the horse and replied "It is his choice, let's let him
572 make it, you will see him soon anyway Peg."
573     A viewing screen showed men in a ship, Piper lay still, while others
574 aurgued over what the man's "living will" was.  Tough choices were to be
575 made.

581 remember i was talking about how junk-mail appeals to peoples fear of rejection?
582 I got a letter a couple of days ago that is a perfect example.  before I type
583 this thing in let me tell you that I have never received anything from this 
584 person before.
585 ****
586    Enclosed is an exact copy of the letter I sent you just a short while ago.
587 The fact I haven't heard a word of any kind from you means that it may not
588 have been delivered -- or that you neglected to read it carefully.
589    To be honest, I can't understand why you didn't jump at such a magnificent
590 chance to "hit the jackpot" --  esoecially since I made some pretty strong claim
591 that I have to honor ... no matter what.(exclamation point)
592    Ill wait just 10 more days to let you still take advantage of this money-
593 making "blockbuster".
594    If I don't hear from you by then -- I don't thaink there'll be any further
595 reason for me to ever contact you again ... because you're a "dreamer" who
596 doesn't know how to take the "bull by the horns" when a windfall drops into
597 your lap.
598    (insert more sales-pitch here)
599 Why am I willing to do this?  To get you to respons.  You know ... it's twice
600 now that I wrote you ... I won't give you the third chance to strike out.

604 Kathy: Sounds like you're typical stupid jerky letter to me.
605 I get them all the time. "If you don't send me $1000 immediately this poor
606 child (insert picture of sorrful looking Asian or African child) will
607 die." Right, $999 of it will probably go in your pocket.
608 Of course there is the ever present "Invest now in pork bellies before 
609 the coming depression. You must do it now because the world will be
610 blown up tommorow." etc.... I have a standard kitchen size trash can
611 that fills up with that trash at a rate of about once a week.
612 For some reason these people seem to think that just because I own a
613 business that I have oodles of money just laying around despiritly needing
614 to be invested. God I wish I did, and I certainly wouldn't invest it in
615 their scam.
