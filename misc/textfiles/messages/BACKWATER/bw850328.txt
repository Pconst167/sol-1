20 I can't believe this, first phone line problems, and now modem problems
21 What the heck is going on around here anyway?!!
22 Have patients, if it doesn't answer, try again later, the modem seems
23 to be getting hung up in an intermittent state everyonce in a while.
24 It isn't suppose to be possible for it to do that, so I'm really shooting
25 in the dark on this one. Also, I don't understand why it should start doing
26 this after working flawlessly for years! It might have something to do with
27 the phone line problems, since it started right after this last fix that
28 the phone company did, whatever it was. But, I'm working on it, so it'll
29 get fixed sooner or later.

43      Sort of interesting the effect this board has on people: we have 
44 numerous, un-named twits who create a sort of siege mentality; we have a
45 few writers who write once or twice, and receive no o
46 comments save negative ones, and we have mutual appreciation society, where
47 old-timers continually congratulate one another on their entries.  Some
48 people take this ritual praise as truth, which leads me to advise one who
49 is "boycotting" BW that her writing isn't quite as good as she believes.  
50 If you enjoy writing, good, but you haven't shown anything of publishable
51 quality yet.  You have potential, but you have to re-work the stories; they
52 show serious neglect of spelling and punctutation.  Proper grammar may not
53 get you published, but lack of it will certainly throw your stories into
54 the "slush-pile"....                      Advice from a pro
55 
56 WHAT IS THAT ABOVE? THE TRUTH? OMIGOSH. SOMEONE HAS THE COURAGE
57 TO SPEAK IT. I THOUGHT THAT NOT POSSIBLE. THE FEINT PRAISE THAT
58 HAS BECOME THE NORM HERE OF LATE HAS MADE MANY OF THE OLD FOLKS
59 SICK TO DEATH. PRO, YOUR ADVICE STRIKES A NERVE. IT CREATES ITS
60 OWN SENSE OF WORTH. THE SLUSH-PILE SWIMS WITH UNTOLD NUMBERS OF
61 SUCH WORKS. DON'T LUMP ALL OLD TIMERS TOGETHER, LEST YOU INSULT
62 THOSE WHO DON'T TAKE PART IN THE  MUTUAL BACK  PATTING AND FEET

135  I seriously like what this system is used for, and would just like to
136 express my feelings.
137      Of course you know, not many systems are like this, but there must
138 be room in this world for the original too. 
139     I happen to be a reader of Issac Aismov, and enjoy his style of
140 writing. I happen to read quite a bit of him and my writing (not so much of
141 this as my stories and editorials) has been influenced and shaped by his.
142 Sort of pathetic, isn't it?  
143    Someday, 	I must type in one of my stories. No doubts in my mind that 
144 you esteemed Editors out there shall tear it to tiny shreds of low 
145 quality, recycled snot wipe but then how does one learn??? How does one
146 become decient??? O.k.??? Mabye even (Gasp!!) GOOD!!????  Only with 
147 extreme luck.
148    Well, my friends, I have wasted enough of your reading time, and 
149 have probally violated many taboos you have established here without
150 my knoweldege. My heartfelt apoliges if I have.

156 Leonard: I took another look at t h vole's entry.  I'm not sure what you
157 are getting at, but I noticed that his erratic As and Hs are erratic in
158 their erraticism. (erraticity?)  Most of the time the faulty keys send
159 a space, but occasionally (usually at the beginning of a word), there is
160 no letter And no space for it.  I myself suspect a fraud.  If a keyboard
161 is missing those two letters, it would be difficult to type commands to the
162 computer, or load a terminal program, or much of anything.  Just the sort
163 of thing anonymity allows the stranger sort to experiment with.  Harumph.

171 As THOR sat at the INN he could hardly believe his ears. From the dark 
172 shadows came howls and hoots from unnamed critics of the people visiting
173 the INN. They seem to feel the need to  excoriate the talents that frequent
174 the INN as if their disparagements were the absolute word of 'GOD'.
175 THOR felt that these poltroons needs to animadvert toward decent scriveners
176 only supported their true colors. It was so easy to castigate anonymously.
177 Like some braying cow whose only recourse is to make noise because it does
178 not have the intelligence to speak. At least a cow will show itself. What
179 manner of mestizo could say such an impiety. Could it be jealousy, 
180 false ego, covetousness, or maybe just  an inability to give praise for at
181 least the attempts made. As THOR knew   that the patrons at the INN were 
182 not emolumented for their efforts
183 then who could critisize whenthem when the critics were not giving 
184 'quid pro quo'. If their stories were not of some peoples taste then there
185 was no need to 'obiter dictum' unless it was their intent to be a
186 'persona non grata'.
187 THOR was glad that they hid in the shadows for he knew that it would be 
188 difficult for him to control the monster that he had put away inside a 
189 dark hole in his heart. 'CAVE CANEM', these words meant a lot to THOR and
190 he best not allow its release. For certainly it was an animal that could 
191 not be controlled. THOR enjoyed the hostelry and its known and good patrons
192 and he hoped that for their sake that he did not discover who the nameless
193 ones were, only that their attacks ceased.
194 THORTHOR-'AVE ATQUE VALE'-THORTHORTHOR
195 
196 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
197   Thor -- please, I believe you owe my milk cow, Lassie, an apology.  Lassie
198 only moos when she wants to be fed a treat (whenever my truck pulls up) or
199 when she has come into heat.  Being compared to self-styled critics whose
200 pathetic attempts at acid wit result in a ph of 7, would surely curdle her milk.
201   Experience has shown that the most effective way of dealing with most of
202 these socially retarded folks is to simply consider the source when seeing 
203 the messages and tune them out.  The mentality is not unlike that of the
204 vandal who chops down a tree in order to deny shad to anyone else.  Typically
205 those who indulge in gratuitous verbal attacks on others with whom they have
206 very little contact are displaying how little they value themselves.  The
207 attacks are really displays of their own feelings about who and what they
208 feel they really are.  The person who is attacked is "standing in" for the
209 inner self of the person doing the attacking.  For example, one who accuses
210 another of lewd or immoral behaviour, on this board usually does not personally
211 know the person accused.  This attack from anonymity usually is a tip-off
212 that the attacker feels that he/she is really the type of person who whould
213 indulge (if courage were sufficient) in the behaviour that he/she condemns.
214   Thus one who attacks anothers intellegence reveals his feeling about the
215 lack in his own intellegence, another who questions the worth of others
216 thus shows that he feels of little personal worth himself.
217   It's easier to ignore these infantile outbursts when you remember that they
218 are the sniffles of children who have not even graduated to the stage of
219 being able to express self-pity.  Sometimes these folks realize what they
220 are doing and mature into valued persons, others simply lose interest when
221 ignored long enough.  Either way, responding to them simply encourages
222 more of the same.  However, don't mistake honest constructive criticism
223 for those cries of self-pity.  It's in sadly short supply in the world, and
224 when offered, well worth taking.

227     Piper: Your advice above is good, pity I am going to deny it.
228     Assassins: Please excuse, it was my fault that people think Kathyd is
229 "boycotting" the Inn. It is my fault that people think that she thinks she
230 is high and above you all. She does not. Apparently, through some misunder-
231 standing, I passed on this inaccurate impression I received. I will admit this
232 impression was of thought they became twisted around in my head, it was not
233 any misspeach on her part. However, if she were to honestly be "boycotting" the
234 Inn, who could blame her? I am truely suprised she steps near. (Yes, that was 
235 the point, right?) I would like to return to that "be nice to everyone month".
236 I must say I do not like you, and you do not like me either. But, it looks like
237 were stuck with each other. To my knowledge, Kathyd (or I) have done nothing to
238 step on you toes. I honestly can not see why you just don't leave her be.
239 Boredom, right? Well, those long critical words you gave her made me think 
240 twice. You can write. Can you not put that to more constructive work? Remember,
241 when something goes liked, it is not always commented on. If I commented on 
242 every piece here I liked, that's all I would do. (I know, better that way, 
243 huh?)     Of late, I have not noticed the "old-timers" giving compliments to
244 only the "old-timers". Sure, they do. But, not only. Is it? (Gosh, maybe you
245 are right...) Anyways, please stop. It would be nice. People don't like getting
246 their feelings hurt, I am sure Kathyd is of no exception. I wish I could 
247 persued (sp! yes, I know) you to write things that we would enjoy reading. 
248 True, people may not say "wow! that's really great", but often times we think
249 it. (Or I do, anyways). Can I get I hurt child's look on my face and stare up
250 at you with pleading eyes? Okay, I know this probabley will not sway your 
251 actions, I wish would. But, at least you will get a laugh out of it, no? This
252 is just that sappy kind of stuff you, right? Well, I would rather you quite
253 being mean and start writing some other stuff (even if nobody comments), but
254 if you decide to continue being mean, go ahead laugh. It would be sort of fun,
255 no? I think it is anyway, pretty sappy. But has a point. -Tanya    please...

259 Thor: In response to you comment on what is now drive B, huh?
260 I have not left any messages addressed to you. Perhaps you mistook
261 someone elses message as mine? Please note that a number of people
262 use the '*' boarder, which is perfectly fine by me, but you should
263 be more observant, I ALWAYS sign the bottom line with CISTOP MIKEY.
264 If it isn't there, it isn't me. Plain and simple.
265 *****************
266 I'm sorry to see the lastest rash of name calling and general
267 childish actions going on here. I would have thought better of you all.
268 The one calling himself (herself?) a pro obviously isn't, else they
269 would be more aware of the world and how it works. Certainly some of
270 the writing here is not exactly top grade, but then remember that 
271 it is typically writen in one sitting, to be put on a system in which
272 it will only see the light of day for maybe 2 or 3 days at the most,
273 and then is relagated to the dusty musty archives never to be seen
274 by mortal eyes again. Many writers here have never done that sort
275 of thing before, and they are flexing their writting musles, seeing
276 if they have the ability, or learning to do better. Some use it
277 simply as a means to exercise and try new concepts. Several of the
278 so called old timers here actually ARE writers, they make a living at it.
279 BW is more like night club like Second City, or the Improv where
280 people can try out and see if they have what it takes, and 'old timers'
281 can try out new material, or spiff up older material and style.
282 As far as bad grammer or spelling, or other misc rude comments, certainly
283 there is a lot of it, how else do you learn whether it is or not.
284 Take the above writting I just did, if is riff with typos, spelling errors,
285 horid grammer, ect.. And yet, I have written awhile myself, and most
286 importantly I made money at it, (the true telltale sign of a professional)
287 The LAST thing I check for is spelling and grammer, and if I'm just
288 putting down an idea for someone to check out, I don't worry about it,
289 because I got the idea across, and that is what counts. If I'm trying
290 to write a finished product, I run it thru a spell checker, a fog checker,
291 have someone else read it for content, ect. but even then it is never
292 perfect, I am a writer not a copyreader. That is why the profession
293 exists, so that writers and editors can spend the time needed to insure
294 that the content is good. This doesn't mean that bad grammer or spelling
295 has no affect, but it is not of prime importance. Just because you don't
296 have the worlds most gramatically correct story doesn't mean it will 
297 be thrown in the corner box with all the other yucko manuscripts. It can
298 make a marginal story get thown away, but it will only marginaly affect
299 a great story. That is why editors are willing to sift thru all that 
300 garbage, in the hopes of finding a diamond studed needle in the middle
301 of the haystack. All to often they must settle for a plain uninteresting
302 ordinary needle, so when it is bent, they just look for another one, but
303 if it looks good enough, there is always time and willingness to straighten
304 it out. Sure rejection is hard to take, but one thing I have always done
305 is try to get the editor to tell me why it was rejected, how can I make it
306 better? Sometimes I get an answer, and those I treasure for the jewles of
307 advice that they are. (Doesn't mean I always follow the bastards advice!)
308 So anyway, people have to learn someplace, we aren't born with perfect
309 writting talent, it is a skill like any other that takes time and exposure
310 to the elements to perfect. (or at least improve)

313      Hmmm.... I came here all primed to spout off, but it seems our beloved
314 Cistop has said it all.  To that I'll add:  Amen!

317 
318 I signed my letter "advice from a pro" because I do indeed earn some small part
319 of my income as a writer, and wished to differentiate between myself and those
320 who are known as assassins, vandals, etc.  While I will concede your point, 
321 Cistop Mikey, that much of the writing here is expository, I am afraid that I 
322 can not agree that that is good.  The first skill a writer must learn is the
323 ability to rewrite his own words.  Without analysis--by oneself or by others--
324 a writer cannot grow, cannot progress beyond the expository stage.  You can tellme that the people who make their entries
325 hunched over a glowing screen late at night do download their story and edit it,
326 but I don't really believe that.  As far as spelling and punctuation are 
327 concerned, errors distract the reader afrom the essentials of what the writer is
328 saying.  In modern America, there are so many words spouring out of typewriters
329 and word-processors that the reader cannot keep up with them.  Have you tried
330 reading the Oregonian cover-to-cover lately? How about trying to read every 
331 one of the computer magazines published each month?  Faced with this, this
332 overwhelming onslaught of verbiage, it is the writer's job to make things
333 easier for the poor reader.  If you choose not to revise and rework, that is
334 certainly your privilege, but don't expect your writing to improve and don't
335 expect to get published.  
336       As far as the "kathyd" situation, I was not attempting to injure her, and
337 I am sorry it was taken in that vein.  My apologies to her if I seemed overly
338 harsh.  I'm afraid thaat  I feel the bulk of my argument stands: you have some 
339 skill, but you must practice, practice, practice!  Just as no one can sit down
340 and write the Brandenburg Concertos without practice, so you cannot write (fill
341 in the favorite novel of your choice) without exercising your "writing muscle."
342       Why do I remain anonymous?  I value my privacy just as much as any of 
343 you, and probably more than most.   I have no wish to be solicited for the name
344 of my agent or to critique someone else's autobiography.  Also, may I point
345 out, YOU are just as nameless--to me, anyway.
346       One last point: there is a famous quote (my Bartlett's doesn't have the
347 quote, so I can't credit the originator)  to the effect "That if engineers 
348 built bridges the way programmers write code, civilization would be destroyed
349 by the first woodpecker to come along."  If you will grant me that point, then
350 perhaps you will grant me this one: if all writers wrote with as little regard
351 for the reader as some do here, wno one would read anything anymore.  You may
352 not be able to write brilliantly, but you can attempt to write properly, so 
353 that you will be understood and (hopefully) appreciated...      "Pro"

358 about 300 lbs.  They have the appearance of being only frames because they use a
359 super plexiglass power field that is clear, but so strong nearly anything
360 bounces off; gives great visability.  The Driver sits in a swivel chair that
361 also turns the powerful turret-gun.  Controls are simply 2 dials that control
362 the gun and tank direction/motion and two buttons controlling speed and firing. 
363 The turret fires small, jet-propelled shells (like long bullets) that streak the

369 everything electronic, because my homing-gun doesn't work.  By the numbers...  I
370 rush back and pull the 10 lunar-pound atomic generator plank from my tank.  It
371 is rather like a blunt, clumsy sword -- long and rectangular.  I hold, as a
372 handle, the actual generator end of it, which is much more rounded.  As the five
373 foes charge at me, waving their own sharp-edged makeshift swords,  I blast them
374 with the pure energy meant to power my wheels.  Whatever the beam touches, it
375 displaces, literally melting my adversaries.  My oxygen is low.  I fight my way
376 to the nearest ground airlock, and take off my pressure suit in the comfort of
377 warm air.  FRAME-Tank War... 2024... DVProductions ... xx     xx

381      I was really upset when I got on last, a couple of days ago, and found
382 that I couldn't make heads or tales of what the computer was spouting at me.
383 I was even more upset when I couldn't get on at all.  Now that I have, how-
384 ever, I found that I haven't missed anything at all.
385      For the people that don't recognize me of my border, I am a lowly 
386 student from OSU that occasionally steals her brother's computer and reads
387 the stuff contained herein.  I don't get down to Rose City from Moo U too
388 often, but I've gotten pretty good at picking up stories in the middle and
389 ENJOYING WHAT I READ.  And this is what I want to sermonize on...
390      I just so happen to be an English major.  I also just so happen to have
391 a talent for proofreading.  I have been performing that service for friends
392 and family for as long as I've had any mastery of my native tongue.  I know
393 good grammar, etc., when I see it, and I also know a good storyline or idea
394 when I see that.  The reason that the "Old-timers" don't remember seeing a
395 story from me is that I know that I'm not up to snuff yet.
396      But I admire the people that write on this board for their hutspa(sp?),
397 and I very much enjoy what I find here.  For, my dear PRO, it is not the 
398 spelling and the grammer that I dial this board up for; it is the stories
399 them selves that I enjoy.  If you can't enjoy a good story installment 
400 because one of the words is misspelled, then I think you should go back to
401 whatever you were doing before you found this board.  I happen to be a lousy typist myself, so I can sympathise with the
402 misspelled words; and if the grammar isn't so hot, then I can rephrase it in
403 my head...but I refuse to listen to anyone telling these terrific writers
404 that because of these mistakes, their stories aren't any good.  It is content
405 that makes a good story, not mechanics: any total twit can put mechanically \
406 perfect words on paper(and maybe even get it published), but that does not a 
407 good story make.
408      In short: to all the writers on this board,old and new:KEEP UP THE GOOD
409 WORK, and ignore the cranks.  Like bad weather, they can't hold out forever.

411 To the writer above, THANK YOU!!!
412 I wish that I had caught your moniker or handle for I would leave you a message
413 on  a more personal basis.
414 To exemplify your words, take the dictionary or encyclopedia.
415 Both are perfect in their grammar and their spelling but who finds their
416 writing exciting, interesting or imaginative? Maybe "pro" but I can think of
417 no other. They are both sets of books that merely give words and information
418 and show no talent of thought only structured investigatory prints. Is this
419 professional writing then? Is this what we are all striving to become?
420 Text writers? No I do not think so. A story by a New Guinea savage is still
421 interesting to many who hear his tale.
422 No matter if his writing is grammically incorrect or his diction imperfect.
423 Writers are judged are their ability to paint a picture, touch a heart or 
424 pierce a soul. There are many professional writers today that do not write
425 a single word. They dictate their thoughts and storylines into a tape recorder
426 and another associate edits those thoughts and idea into a finished product.
427 Usually those associates are doing their job as they do not have the talent
428 of the person that they edit. So it appears to THOR, as 'PRO' considers his 
429 or herself a professional because of income benefitted through its effort.
430 THOR has benefitted for his writings also but those writings could not be
431 judged imaginative nor inspirational.
432 No indeed, not unless the teaching of the operations of deadly weapons could
433 be construed to be authoritic. No 'PRO'
434 I do not forsee your being an asset for the INN. It is obvious from the heated
435 response that has shown its ugly head concerning the merits of your arguments
436 only shows that constructive critism is what the users want on this board.
437 Irritants can sometimes get a rise of a few for a short time but usually they
438 are ignored and they disappear. You must
439 derive some pleasure from this board or else you wouldn't keep coming back.
440 If it is not up to your standards then I can get you the number for Compuserve
441 ry of congress where you can browse your hearts content on professional 
442 quality materials.
443 Or is it perhaps you desire attention, be it even negative attention
444 in order to get some kind of recognition for your existence. I used to have
445 the same problem with my baby girls before they grew up a little. They too
446 suffered recognition as they thought because their mother and father did not
447 love each other anymore than perhaps it spread over to them.
448 Is this it 'pro' are you looking for someone to show you some love or 
449 effection? There are plenty of people here at the INN that can give that 
450 to you. Please try to excersise your efforts toward a positive attention
451 rather than a negative one. Why not leave us a sample of your writings so 
452 that we can enjoy your material too? You may find some critics because of
453 the prejudiced attitude that you have set up but if you take the chance maybe
454 you might even get some praise. After all, isn't that what you are looking for?
455 Come on now, give us a try, THOR hasn't maimed anyone since 1968 so I'm
456 out of practice anyway.

458 My God Guardian, stop me when I get so damn philosophical.......THOR

461      Thank you, THOR!!  Long time no positive strokes!!
462      As I seem to have forgotten it last time, this particular lowly college
463 student's name is

466     Luingil: I was right behind Thor all the way as he applauded you. I was
467 honestly considering sleep teaching myself into being a good speller. I knew
468 I would never be able to handle the grammer thing, so I decided that I would
469 just have to quit these stories and right only poetry. (No rules). Really,
470 thanks. It was sort of weird to look around the Inn and see vicious faces.
471 (I, much to my dismay, include myself). I admit, your face is not much known
472 to me, but it was if I saw my only friend standing as you did. Thanks!
473     Pro: I am very wishy-washy. I can understand (sort of) what you were saying
474 but I got the impression you were shouting in our ears. Not a pleasant sound,
475 even if given in good faith. Yes, we all need practice. But, maybe if we are
476 so bad grammatically, we would have somebody correct our work. The thing is,
477 I really did not expect to find any professinals out there looking over my
478 words saying "gee, she has a problem with run-on sentences and commas". I know
479 that I have that problem. But, that is the way I THINK. I also think backwards
480 in varies other ways, too. Most of which I translate into common English or
481 else it really would not make any sense. With my terminal I have not the 
482 ability to download (as far as I know) nor do I have a machine that will spell-
483 check my work. I honestly have trouble with dictionaries even though I can 
484 recite the alphebet very well (better than spell it). So I do not have all 
485 these options to make my stuff perfect before I set it here. (Not that I could
486 make it "perfect").     You have received alot of attacks. Sorry. But, maybe
487 you do not understand how you appear. "I am the pro, I know what's what. All
488 you guys are so much less than me. You can't even spell!" etc. I do not think
489 this is what you mean. (I hope not). But, it took alot of thinking to draw
490 this conclusion. I think almost everyone that writes here feels personally
491 insulted. Alot of what you said was very true, in my opinion. But, it was your
492 words that sounded harsh, making it seem like an attack. Anyways, I would 
493 greatly enjoy reading some of your stuff. Please do write here. (Although I
494 suggest you throw in a few spelling errors, grammar problems, just so we won't
495 suspect who it is. You got everyone at your throa, see. It was good to keep 
496 identity covered. Besides, if you didn't people might figure out who you was
497 and say "he/she ain't no pro! Sure, that makes sense but..." No, really, 
498 please do share.     Excuse the space I consumed. My thoughts ran away. -Tanya

513   To all -- as an "ol'timer" let me throw in a few thoughts.  The inn goes t
514 through cycles ... stories, arguments, anger, love.  Let's not stand in the
515 way and let the pendulum swing on, try to keep the criticism constructive, and
516 remember the feelings of those you speak of and to.  As long as we're human,
517 we'll misunderstand one another, get angry and say (or write) things we will
518 later regret.  It's ephemeral here as cistop mikey says.  Barkeep, a round
519 for the house, and I'll try to continue my story.
520 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
521 (what has gone before)  The piper out for a midnight ride upon the pegasus
522 has wandered into a land of solidified clouds.  He has entered a public
523 house of some kind and been welcomed by Koom Youlus, a large hearty man
524 and Rainbow, a most attractive lady.  While the inn has been undergoing
525 a spate of incivility, the piper has become acquainted with his new friends...
526    
527     The process by which we become acquainted is like a formal dance -- the
528 participants move forward and back, exposing and concealing in a rather
529 specialized ritual.  There are undercurrents of concealed hostility, lust,
530 the urge to dominate one over another.  The participants assume different
531 roles, trying to weave a social fabric that allows the development of a 
532 genuine affection and liking for each other.  Each tugs at the developing
533 garment that enfolds the group, easing his or her own fit, until the breaking-in
534 period has produced a comfortable fit.
535   The roles the small party soon assumed were preordained by the long
536 acquaintanship that all but the piper had with one another.  Koom played the
537 bluff, hearty host -- the father figure to whom all the others deferred.
538 The others (the piper never did get all the names straight) played out their
539 own roles Alt the lofty intellect, Seris (or was it Nimbus?) the wayward
540 daughter.  The names did not matter, the roles were there.
541   In new aquaintanships there are also electric moments.  Part of the pleasure
542 to be had from people is the pleasure of the unexpected.  Another is the
543 sharp exitement of chemistry that seems to fall into synchronization.
544   During the banter and exchange, the piper had become acutely aware of
545 Rainbow's presence.  The soft warmth against his arm set his pulse racing
546 when she reached across the table for a refill of her ale, the pressure of
547 her leg along his kept him unacustomedly still.  The human body, however,
548 has certain physical limitations build in -- after a certain amount of liquid
549 has been consumed, room must be made should one wish to consume more.
550 The piper, after delicately indicating this to Koom, his host, was quite
551 startled when that worthy gentleman called out in a rather loud voice,
552   "All right everybody -- let's go unload!"
553   Trailing behind the noisy party, the piper stifled his startlement, and
554 after a few moments followed the group into a large communal rest room.
555 After a brief bout of shyness, the piper following the lead of the other male
556 members of the party stood up to a large silver-lined trough used for a
557 urinal.  Glancing across the room, he was just in time to notice Rainbow
558 hoisting her skirts over what appeared to be a solid gold commode.  The 
559 thought flashed through his brain before he could suppress it...
560   "I've often heard of the pot of gold....."
561 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
562 Bravo, Piper.!  Responses to others (Tanya, Luingil, and Thor are being 
563 
564   transferred to paper, and I will enter them later.  I would be quite happy
565   to transfer this to another board, but as I mentioned earlier, I don't know
566   who you are, and therefore cannot send messages to you.  (pretend that there
567   is a closed parentheses after Thor, please)        Pro

569 Near the bottom... and so much discussion above.  Perhaps I'll enter something
570 substantial tomorrow, when there's more elbow room.  Personally, I don't mind
571 incorrect spelling (much), improper grammer, etc.  What I call here for is to
572 read the stories.  That's it.  As long as it's interesting, and mostly legible,
573 it's okay by me.

576 All: I've read some information about a writing contest held by Avon/Flare
577 books, and I think that I will participate.  I have until August to complete
578 it, and it must be about teenagers and written for teenagers.  Does anyone mind
579 if I enter sections of it here for review?  Perhaps I can make use of that

599    There seems to be a great deal of argument concerning critical entries
600 created by "unnamed individuals."  I happen to be one of these individuals.
601 Because most of the attacking and defending statements on this system are
602 quite vague, I'm uncertain whether any of the defensive comments were actually
603 directed towards me.
604    Though my opinion stands, I would like to apologize--it was in questionable
605 tast for me to put down other writer's entries.
606    It's interesting to see that most of the outcry against critical entries
607 appear in the form of a vow never to comment on critical entries.  I'd also 
608 like to point out that the writers who condemn negative comments have 
609 developed the annoying habit of psychoanalyzing the ones who made the 
610 comments.  It's completely irresponsible to attempt to understand a person's
611 inner thoughts and feelings based on a single entry.  It's obviously true that
612 a person who makes destructive statements has character flaws, but I would 
613 advise you to be less hasty in your judgments...a tendency which is also
614 extremely destructive.
615    Well, enough soap-boxing.  It's time to get back to writing (fiction) which
616 I will do as soon as Mikey switches disks, moving my formerly mentioned 
617 negative comments to drive C.
