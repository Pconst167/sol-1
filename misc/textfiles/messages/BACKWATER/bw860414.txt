47 have been able to be here. An old Albanian friend..."
48 He thought silently to himself, 'Wassir, you old rascal, where are you, my friend?'
49 He continued;"Now- before we get to the heart of this, there are some photographs that you will want

81     Reagan has selected Libya to wage war against since the transient state
82 of Palestine can not be warred against.  A scape goat is the term.  If, by
83 some rediculous error in judgement, Colonel Qadhafi [Wall Street Journal
84 spelling] rises to Arab power after this, the Twentieth Century Crusades
85 have started.
86     I would like to ask the intrigue authors to leave the Libyan Crescendo
87 in the newspapers.  It is a serious issue for America and the world and any
88 references in spy stories will only be inappropriate.  Night...

106 --------------------------------Lier-----------------------------------------
107 Leir wasted a night of sleep in sweat. His sheets needed washing by the time
108 he awoke. His eyes refused to open and his legs muscles were strained. It was
109 easily as miserable as before he had gone to sleep.
110     It was the fright of the Regiment that troubled him. In one day's time,
111 he would be in the company of men. Fierce ruffians. Scarred and brutal men.
112 Who used their brawn doing dastardly errands. Raping women. Putting to death
113 those who would be men. Errands of torture and death in the name of the
114 Gentleman Marsh.
115     By influence of his mother, he had been inducted into the Regiment. He
116 would set out for their camp. Their training and arms would be given to him.
117 Along with the uniform of their ranks. It might be a better fate than those
118 who were not to join them.
119     His walk that day, ended with the first sight of their encampment. Not
120 daring to camp in the compass of a hidden bow, they had arranged themselves
121 in the middle of a wide plain. Their tent's pale fabric mingled with the
122 stewing clouds. A tall and richly dressed man came on a horse from behind
123 Lier. He clutched at his tunic's collar, and lifted him into the air. When
124 the man rode into camp with Lier levitated astride his horse, the entire
125 Regiment laughed at him.
126     His hair was sheared. His body was purified with salts. His clothes were
127 burned and replaced with the silver and blue uniform. His thoughts were
128 occupied with the sights of cruelties he saw in their training.
129     In a couple of days, poor Lier had been submitted to indignity after
130 indignity. And had taken to being the butt of the Regiment's jokes. A
131 ion which he used to avoid serious punishments. Being paddled in front
132 of the men for pilfering a loaf was better than the flogging others might
133 have gotten for the same deed.
134     His ass was still sore one day. Then he saw a woman being taken into one
135 of the tents. Knowing that this is what he had dreaded only days ago, he
136 decided to use their training against them. Liberties had been taken with th
137 poor lady even as soon as he arrived at the front of the tent.
138     The finely dressed man pushed him aside. It was then that Lier realized
139 this man was the Gentleman Marsh, purveyor of the Regiment. Marsh pushed the
140 other men of the Regiment aside also, finding the lady to his satisfaction,
141 he had the tent sealed from the gawking soldiers.
142     Her cries fell on deaf ears as they stumbled away. To tend their own
143 fires, and meals. This left only Lier at the front of the tent. He had an
144 idea and followed through with it impulsively.
145     "Gentleman, Sir! Some wine for you?" Lier felt for the bottle he had
146 gotten with the loaf, it was in his sack. As the Gentleman asked for the
147 wine, Lier readied his blade. Soon he was inside. The lady was gasping for
148 breath beneath the fat swine.
149     "I will open it for you, Gentleman, Sir!" Lier got his knife and plucked
150 away at the wooden stopper. Marsh kept his rubbings on, so Lier promptly slit
151 him along his belly. His life drained out quickly and silently. The lady
152 squirmed away and cowered into a corner.
153     "Please, come now or we may never get away!" The lady stepped over the
154 corpse and took his hand. Sobbing. Lier opened the side of the tent with his
155 knife and stepped onto the grassy plain. He dragged the lady's hand as he
156 dodged from tent to tent, avoiding the songs of the Regiment's men. As they
157 made their way to the forest from the plain, the first cries of discovery
158 found their ears.
159     "Lady, I am shot!" An arrow had found his liver from the camp. His fears
160 only nights before had been realized. His moral disgust had led to his murder
161 by the Regiment. His only duty now was to deserve his death. He told the lady
162 to find the way to his house and his mother.
163     The lady now serves the mother. She washes sheets and dishes. She thinks
164 about Lier who had helped her. His body laid where it was left, and rotted
165 away. As if it never mattered, and I guess it never did. Did it?

248  Hi it's me again here to finish my thoughts for tonight. Now that
249 I have been humbled by the home computer, let alone tied up computer
250 time which is your life blood let me continue. I have recently learned
251 that you have quiet a following of poets therefor I will reciet a
252 poem that I have composed and you can't use it ever. As follows:
253 HOW MANY MILES TO MY RAINBOW, WHERE IS MY BUCKET OF GOLD.
254 ALL I'VE GOT HERE IS A BUCKET OF BEER AND SOME CHICKEN WINGS
255 14 DAYS OLD. 
256 BUT CHICKEN O CHICKEN YOU SAVED MY LIFE ,YOU FED ALL MY CHILDREN
257 BUT COST ME MY WIFE. ALL CAUSE OF CHICKEN I CANT EVEN SPEAK CAUSE
258 NOW I'M GROWING A 14 FOOT BEAK.

260 SUNDAY BRUNCH.

275           I'm funny lookin', 'cause you are what you eat...
276 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
277 What a bunch of #$%&. Terrorism is not a political problem. It is a military problem, and can be stopped only by
278 military actions. What we did to Libya was not enough. It is time we showed them we mean business. We should hit them
279 again and again, untill they have learned. For once I actually support Reagan... DV

349 I found the real reason for the American action in North Africa. It is a
350 conspiracy between the United States Government and Teledyne. They plan
351 to detonate nuclear device in the desert and create enormous fields of
352 glass. To be transported to Teledyne facilities, be ground into fine grains
353 of sand, and aid in the Strategic Defense Initiative.
354 I hope this enlightens a few of you to the devious nature of Teledyne, a
355 McKane industry.

417   The Name's Kadaffy.
418 
419 Anyhow, enough of such frivolity. I 
420 wish that there had been some other way, and if the European countries 
421 had assisted us in our plan to economically boycott Libya, this wouldn't
422 have had to happen, or so I surmise. But they wouldn't help us, and even
423 after we gave fair warning. So I think that this was our last alternativ
424 I still think that any loss of life is futile, and with my luck, all you
425 out there are hopeless conservatives whothink that death, blood and 
426 violence is the answer to everything. The person above, who wrote NUKEE
427 'EM about five times honest to god scares me, even if the entry was left
428 in jest. It is hard to value human 
429 life if you don't know the people whose lives you are valuing, I.E. 
430 Libyans. I know that people who use this bbs are intelligent enough to 
431 know that Kaddafy is the lunatic in this picture, not the Libyan citizen
432 But when the bomb drops, it does not discriminate. It does not yet have 
433 the power to hunt out and destroy only the bad guys. I personally think 
434 that a well ordered assasination followed by close watching and 
435 appropriate action is called for. I suppose you could call me a democrat
436 but I'd rather be known as a humanist.

439 P.S.  Did you know that after our raid to save democracy, Kaddafy
440 apparently wasn't hurt. But his infant daughter was killed. Yea America.

444  GOOD WORDS A. RIV. PHELPS. GOOD WORDS. MY ONLY ARGUMENT IS THAT MABEY
445  A WELL TRAINED ASSASIN COULD KILL UNCLE RON, AS HENIOUSLY UNPATRIOTIC
446  AS IT MAY SEEM. YEA, I WAS HOPING FOR HINKLEY TO HAVE DONE HIM IN AND
447  FOR THE CANCER, BUT A GOOD CIA OR NSA BULLET COULD DO THE TRICK.
448  (THIS IS STRICTLY *AGAINST* SATANIC POLICIES, BUT HEY, IM JUST
449  A FAIR WEATHER SATANIST ANYWAY....)
450  EITHER WAY, I HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF KILLING ANYONE, LIBYAN, RUSSIAN,
451  CHINESE, OR EVEN THE EVIL INCARNATED BEING OF KADAFI/REAGAN. 
452 ENOUGH BABLLE.....

454   P.S.---GOOD LUCK ASSASIN-O-KEEPER!

457 of the world...

459 
460 That wouldn't do any good at all to kill of the Pres.  If anything it 
461 would make it worse, for the US that is.  Terrorists would see that as
462 a sign to go in and attack!

508 Ooh, ha ha. Such fools you all are! Hah, I can not see through this web
509 of electrical wiring you hide behind. Oh, sure you are hidden well. And
510 yes, you think Satan is on your side, but there are worse than him!
511 The Celts, the Druids, the False Bishops, they tried to master them and
512 failed. I made a deal, and now I am their master! A decent pagan diety
513 will decimate your faith as quickly as you urinate!
514 Ooh, ha ha. See you in your nightmares!

520      Hmmmmm.... I've always liked the Celts.  Larry Bird is one of the
521 best players alive today.  Never heard of the Druids though.... must

620 Sometimes, when I log in, with my $3000 system, automated login scripts
621 and other paraphenalia, I look back at the pathetic little kid I once 
622 was with a stolen modem, a vt52 terminal and a phone number. I remember 
623 the excitement that this number once provided, and I feel sorrow for 
624 this board. For technology has made it possible for any idiot to use 
625 a bbs system. I wish I could return to those days, 3 years ago. 
626 Sometimes progress hurts.
