22      Beams of pale yellow light bathe me as I enter the establishment of spirits.  Sounds of clinking glass along
23 with the smell of warm drinks and stale cigarette smoke overwhelm me.  Something about the echo of the voices
24 tells me that I'm in the right place.  I amble to the counter that has long been abandoned by customers.
25      "Hello... Stuart.  Are you still serving dinner?"
26      "You walked up right in time; we stop serving in..."  A strange look came over his face.  "Is that really
27 you?"  I barely nodded.  "My god, it's been..."
28      "It has been awhile.  Let us just say that it has been awhile."  My eyes remained lowered, never making long
29 establishing contact with his.  "Have you been here all this time?  Looking over the business?"
30      "Nah, I've been out of slinging the ice cubes for some time.  I came back not too long ago just to help out
31 with the income.  Tips and all that fun stuff.  Know what I mean?" he asked with a wink and a nod.
32      "I suppose.  Listen Stuart, I'm looking for a friend..."
33      "Ain't we all?  Hey, if you're not looking for anything serious, there's this one dame that..."
34      "No, that is not what I had in mind.  I'm looking for someone inparticular.  I'm looking for a Mr. Smirnoff.
35 Perhaps you remember seing me with him before?  I would like to have a few words with him if I may."
36      Pausing for a moment one could almost see the light come on for Stuart.  "Oh, sure!  Yea, Mr. Smirnoff.  I
37 think I can get him for you."  He draws a clean glass and a bottle from the shelf behind him.  "Okay, here comes
38 Mr. Smirnoff now."
39      "There are quite a few matters I have to go over with him.  The sooner I get started the better."  Stuart
40 has hardly enough time to turn around before I comment.  "I'm having a bit of a problem hearing him.  Do you
41 think you could get him to speak up a little louder?"  He notices the now empty glass.
42      "You've got it.  A double, straight-up, coming up."
43      I raise the glass to my lips and take this one a little slower.  "Now you are talking Mr. Smirnoff..."

58    As he advanced James jammed a hand into his boot and whipped out the derringer. The Commander hesitated in
59 surprise. He had one shot. He tried to aim but the barrel just wouldn't stay in one place. The Commander lept forward
60 just as James fired.
61    A large hole appeared right where the Commander's heart used to be. He fell on his face about four feet short and
62 didn't move. Immediately the fog lifted and James could think again. "Indiana Jones has nothing on me." he commented,
63 blowing smoke from the barrel.
64    Reholstering the gun, he tried to stand up. James had experienced pain before but rarely like this. His whole back
65 felt like it was on fire and his left arm still wouldn't respond. He finally got to his feet and turned and was amazed
66 at the size of the stain that had soaked into the bedsheets. The Commander must have done him some major damage. With
67 all the blood that had run out of him in the last twelve hours he must be nearly empty.
68    The force field around Tariya dissipated with the Commander's death but she was still out. Probably drugged. James
69 wondered if the bastard had done anything to her while she was unconcious and wished he could kill him again. He
70 managed to summon the sword, but his strength was fading fast. He only hoped he could open a warpgate.
71    The swordtip traced an oval in the air. A thin blue line remained, floating in midair. He dropped the sword and
72 picked up Tariya, which wasn't easy one-handed. He faced the oval for a second and watched it fade. If it went out
73 completely, he wouldn't have enough strength to try again. He would die here.
74    Then the air inside the oval collapsed with a bang and he was looking through it into a laboratory. On the other
75 side of the gate several white-suited technicians turned and stared back in astonishment. One called his name
76 questioningly.
77    James stumbled through the warpgate. Tariya's weight unbalanced him and he toppled. As he fell, he twisted so as
78 not to land on her. He landed on his wound instead. The pain was so intense that he couldn't even cry out. The last
79 thing he remembered was several anxious faces staring down at him as unconciousness forcibly claimed him.
80    He wondered if he would ever wake up.

83 WHY DO PEOPLE INSIST ON POLLUTING THIS SYSTEM WITH THEIR PURPLE PROSE?  I MEAN
84 REALLY, THE SAME OLD "DUNGEONS & DRAGONS" MOTIF OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  WHAT I
85 FIND ESPECIALLY PATHETIC ARE THE ATTEMPTS TO CREATE NAMES SUCH AS TARIYA WHICH
86 ARE SUPPOSED TO EVOKE AN OTHERWORLDLY ATMOSPHERE. B O R I N G ! ! !
87  They're rioting in Africa, they're starving in Spain
88 1Theres hurricanes in Florida, and Texas needs rain
89 The whole world is festering with unhappy souls
90 The French hate the Germans, the Germans hate the Poles
91 Italians hate Jugoslave, South Africans hate the Dutch
92 And Scots don't like anybody very much...
93 But we should be tranquil and thankful and proud
94 Cause mans been endowed with a mushroom shaped cloud
95 And we can be certain that some lovely day
96 Someone will set the spark off and we will all be blown away...

112              State police had been deployed to all universities
113            following the signing of the Act, to quell any possible
114            violence. It was a natural decision to have them 
115            keep close tabs on George too. George was assigned his
116            very own personal tail to shadow him everywhere
117            on campus. The tail's job description included
118            keeping George under close observation and taking
119            down the identities of all students and faculty who spent
120            an inordinate amount of time with him. Since George was
121            so popular on campus, the State police tail had a very
122            busy job. George quickly became aware of the tail's
123            presence, but figured there was nothing much he could do
124            about it. He felt confident he could lose the tail if it
125            really became necessary.
126  
127         The marketing professor appeared at his podium. It was time to set the
128 book down and start taking notes. Today's lecture: Subliminal Suggestion for
129 Home-bound Housewives. For the next hour and a-half, Tim had to be
130 a busy student paying attention to the teacher during the lecture. Tim couldn't
131 get the book out of his mind though. There was something about the story,
132 the way Tim read it. George Gratis... Police State... 1997... Am-Euro Act...
133         Tim's head spun. The images before his eyes shimmered like the
134 reflections off the smooth surface of a mountain lake, suddenly disturbed
135 by a skipping rock. Professor Gratis... Personal Freedom... Shimmering...
136 Classroom... 1985... 1997... Political Science... Professor Gratis...
137 Lights... Blackness... Dark... Void... Desolation... Illumination...
138 Luminescent... Brilliant... Classroom... 1997...
139  
140         "So as you see, the continued growth of a strong central state does
141 have it uses, but only if the cardinal conviction of this state is the
142 preservation of basic human rights. A state where its people are subjugated
143 is hardly an improvement over what existed 20 or more years ago in the
144 fragmented governments of this planet. If anything, a militaristic government
145 is a digression away from the ideal, not a move towards it."
146         Tim realized something strange had occurred. His mind whirled. This
147 was no longer "3-D Marketing Strategies..." What happened to Professor Dinero?
148 Who is this guy talking about ideal governments? The classroom! It's all
149 painted red. The desks! They look like something out of a futuristic
150 science fiction movie. Futuristic... wait... My clothes are all different.
151 This isn't my class! What has happened? Omigod!
152         The professor at the podium was now drawing comparisons on Karl Marx's
153 Communist Manifesto versus current advances into socialist states. Tim sat
154 still, stunned, unable to comprehend what had happened to him. 
155         Even my books aren't the same. All except for my copy of "George's
156 War." This prof. sounds a lot like George Gratis. Funny. I must be dreaming,
157 fallen asleep during the lecture. Everything is so real though. No I couldn't
158 be asleep. It's not drugs either. At least I don't think I took any drugs. No,
159 I would remember if I took drugs. This whole thing...the room, the teacher,
160 my clothes, the other students they're all different. It's as if I were
161 somehow transported to some other place...
162         A question by one of the other students brought Tim's reasoning too
163 a grinding halt.
164         "Professor Gratis? Do you think the Am-Euro Act had significant roots
165 in the big redistribution-of-wealth movements of the late eighties?"
166         Professor Gratis? Late eighties?
167         Tim didn't hear the professor's reply to the question. He was to
168 busy having his own reality blown away.

    "The forest is a forest,"  Exclaimed the Pastor.
188     "See the forest for the trees!  A forest isn't a forest, it's a
189 lot of trees!  Can't you see?"
190     "The forest is a forest!  Why don't you see that?"  Puzzled the
191 Pastor.  Who then sat over the table, rubbing his eyes, drawing deep
192 from his ale, and mumbling softly.
193     "Why don't you see it my way?"
194     "I don't.  Alright?"
195 
    As their lively little debate died down and everyone had a little
196 time to reflect on the matters debated, several people wanted their
197 say.  Some started grumbling and mumbling on their own and most
198 simply downed another pint of ale.

199     "Excuse me,"  Said one neglected patron, who seemed more than a
200 little nervous, "It appears to me that you are tired of this debate
201 and tired of each other,"
202     The Pastor looked over to his fellow debater.  If they were so
203 tired of each other, this was the first they had heard.
204     "Why drudge on through difficult debates?  Why demand they must
205 agree with you?  Why not leave well enough alone?"  The nervous
206 and neglected patron seemed to calm with every word.
207     The Pastor saw in his friend the same look.
208     "Why assign such values to what you say?"
209     The look of bewilderment and silly regret.
210     "Ever known one person to be convinced in these things?"
211     The Pastor and friend smiled and chuckled together.
212     "Stop taking things so litterally,"
213 
    The Pastor giggled a bit and settled down for what he thought
214 would be a long pep talk.  He was pouring his drink down his throat
215 when he heard the nervous one say-
216     "Besides, a forest is a grove!"

238     After logging it to the terminal for cross-reference, Linda slipped
239 the last newspaper clipping into its folder, placed it in the box with
240 the rest, and sent the lot off to be microfilmed.
241     Seizing the quiet moment to herself, she leaned back in her chair,
242 hands behind her head, and reflected on what she had been able to
243 pick up since assuming the position of Ian's gopher. 
244 Agents L'homme sans Parity and Fellows were about to go off on a
245 mission, where or what it was, she hadn't yet determined. Wassir and
246 frend had checked into the Bogart Arms, Delta V was busy blowing up
247 safety deposit boxes, and she still hadn't the faintest clue as to
248 the Net's true purpose or intent.
249      The intercom buzzed, meaning Ian needed her to fetch someone or
250 something again. She sighed, put on her best Pollyanna smile, and
251 was off.

265      "The forest, yes, the forest." Fellows paled with every word.
266      "Remember, relax. You are telling me this so I can help you. Nothing
267 in the dream can hurt you know. But in retelling your dream it will most
268 likely help you." Dr Macrobius' voice was calm and reassuring. Some of the
269 color returned to Fellows' face.
270      "Sure Doctor. I know... OK. As I turned and went into the forest, I
271 noticed how very dark and deep it was. It was peculiar that a small trail
272 had been cut in the exact spot I entered. I chose my entry into the forest
273 at random, and I did not see the trail until I was right on top of it, but
274 there it was. Anyway, I moved through the forest over this trail. Sunlight
275 trickled down between the tall trees into patches of yellow here and there
276 on the forest bed. It was pretty dark, but there was enough ambient light to
277 make my sojourn safe, or so I thought." Fellows paused again, drew in a deep
278 breath, and continued. Dr Macrobius' hand flew across his pad as he took
279 notes.
280      "I started noticing the trees. I didn't know what kind they were, but
281 they looked familiar. It was just like the people in the clearing. I could
282 not identify them, but I thought I knew them. I know that is crazy sounding,
283 how could I know trees..."
284      "You let me interpret Fellows. Do not judge yourself like that."
285      "Sure, OK... Well anyway, I guess I got a little scared, because I
286 started walking faster. I had turned my head to look behind when I walked
287 into something. I got up and saw a tree, perfectly trimmed, growing in the
288 middle of the trail. It was just standing there, branches neatly cut, reaching
289 out across the trail. It loomed over me. I got up and ran past it best I
290 could. The trail started to narrow. The trees were encroaching on the edge
291 of the trail. And I did not feel any familiarity towards the trees like I had
292 before. I started running faster, further into the forest. The sunlight seemed
293 to be fading, and it was getting difficult to see very far ahead. I tripped
294 a couple times on roots that protruded out in the trail. I got up as fast as
295 I could and continued running. I had lost all sense of direction. My heart
296 was pounding again, but this time I could hear everything that was happening,
297 the sound of my feet on the trail, my breathing, everything. And then I
298 decided to stop. I stood there, bent over, catching my breath. I heard a
299 voice, somewhere behind me. I spun around, and in a particularly large
300 patch of light stood the woman from the clearing who had waved at me. She was
301 standing there smiling, her arms extended and her hands clasped in front of
302 her. I realized she had spoken my name, and I started moving towards her."
303      Again Fellows paused, and again some of color left his face.
304      "Go ahead Fellows. You mustn't stop now. It is important that you relay
305 this episode."
306      "I will Doctor, just a second please, while I catch my breath."

337 line - the one with the "JD" and a bunch of numbers following.  Contrary to
338 popular belief, it does not stand for the 'hit' record of a Juvenile Delinquent.
339 It is rather a dating system used commonly in astronomy, with a starting point
340 sufficiently far in the past (January 1, 4713 B.C.) to avoid fluctuations in the
341 calendar, such as the several days which were lost a few hundred years ago.
342 So, the "2446408" means that there have been 2,446,408 days since 1/1/4713 B.C.
343 The fractional part of the number is, of course, the fractional part of the day.
344 .2500 would  be 1/4 of a day, or 6 hours.  The person using the marker has
345 cleverly realized that the Julian Day starts at Noon, not Midnight, so when 
346 you take the .0529 and convert it into 01:16:11, it is not a quarter past 1 in
347 the morning, but rather a quarter after 1 in the afternoon.  Unfortunately,
348 what the user apparently failed to discover is that the Julian Date system is
349 an Absolute, not a Relative. In other words, 2446408.0529 here in Portland
350 references the exact same instant as 2446408.0529 does in Moscow, USSR.
351 Obviously then, it can't be dependent on local time, but is rather based on
352 Greenwich noon, which is currently at 4 am.  So, what the _JD author is calling
353 2446408.0529 is actually 8 hours later, or 2446408.3862.  Close in the cosmic
354 scale, but hopelessly off in a useable sense.  From a practical standpoint,
355 however, it would be better to fudge even more and call .0000 local midnight,
356 so then you see .5000 you would know it's noon, rather that having to go through
357 all the mathematical contortions to discover what it Really is.

512 
513      The door of the Bogart Arms elevator slid shut, and the contraption
514 moved upward accompanied by the groaning of ancient machinery.  Wassir
515 turned to the gnomish bell boy and said, "Excuse me, is there a represent-
516 ative of the Crudleco corporation in this hotel?"
517      "Never heard of 'em,"  the bell boy rasped.
518      Wassir sighed and reached into his pocket.  He withdrew several Swiss
519 francs and stuffed them into the gnome's jacket.  "Hmmmm...."  Wassir said,
520 "perhaps these will help your hearing problem."
521      "Oh yes sir, I'm sure they will."  The gnome said as he glanced at the
522 bills.  "Crudleco has a hospitality suite on the top floor.  They have some
523 wild parties up there, let me tell you.  Strange people.... strange outfits
524 .... they even took a bunch of ducks up there one time.  You shoulda seen
525 the place afterwards, feathers all over.  Terrible."  The gnome shook his
526 head.
527      "Is there anyone up there now?"  Maria asked.
528      "Haven't seen no one, but they got a private elevator so's the guests
529 don't have to go through the hotel lobby."
530      "Does this elevator go up to the hospitality suite?"  Wassir said.
531      "Yup, sure does... but it has to be called from the suite itself.  If
532 you'll notice, the buttons only go to twelve."  The gnome motioned to the
533 control panel.  "The Crudleco suite is on the fourteenth floor."  The 
534 elevator wheezed to a stop.  "You'll have to walk up a floor to your suite
535 on thirteen.  They added a couple of floors in '06 and never fixed the
536 elevator."  The gnome walked Wassir and Maria up a narrow stairway and to
537 their suite. 
538      The room was your average dumpy European hotel suite, gauchely done
539 in red and black velveteen.  On a table in the center of the living room
540 was an enormous bouquet of lavender carnations.  Maria tipped the bell boy,
541 while Wassir looked at the card attached to the flowers.  It read:
542 
543      My dearest Mohammed,
544         So nice of you to drop in.  It's been boring since Professor
545      Stuffit left, and I've heard so much about you.  I do hope you
546      live up to your reputation.
547                                            With all my love,
548                                            China Blue
549 
550      "Ahem,"  Maria said with a dangerous sparkle in her eye.  "And just who
551 is China Blue?"
552      "Darned if I know,"  Wassir said.  "But I'm sure we'll find out."
553      "Just remember I don't get even, I get mad."
554 
555 *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Valinor *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
556 
557 HAh, I haven't heard any good 12-13-14 floor building jokes since that
558 escapade in the Oklahoma City Hilton all those years ago. Keep up the
559 good work Valinor.
560 							L.s.P.
561    The cooks assistant was slouched against the brick wall of the back of the Bogart Arms, smoking
562 a cigarette. He had the look of boredom and too many months of being talked down to by "chefs".
563    He didn't even look up as he heard someone approach untill a hand reached forth and grabbed the
564 collar of the white linen jacket that was the standard dress for employees of his level.
565    The expression on the face of the bull of a man looking down at him quickly dispensed any feelings
566 of being bored. The man spoke. " Well, now, my man, you look like you need a break". "I was, uh just
567 uh..." The man interrupted him. " I always wanted to be a cook, see, so I'll tell you what- I'll
568 rent your uniform for a while, and you trot off down the street and have yourself a drink, OK?" 
569    The folded S
570 wiss franks in the mans hand were what the cook saw first, then he noticed the Walther P-38 in his
571 other hand. "Uh, yeah, I was gettin' thirsty, now that you mention it..." As he was leaving, he 
572 heard the man say, "If you come back in less than an hour, you'll never have to worry about food
573 again, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?" A yessirr floated back, but Delta Five was already inside the kitchen.
574 Working quickly, he approached a room service attendant in a gaudy red velvet jacket, and pulled
575 him off to the side, by the door of the walk-in. "I'll deliver this personally, son, and you find
576 the sous chef and tell him that the Veal cordonBleu for table 12 was refused." 
577    This would distract him long enough...
578 Moving the room service cart over to the chef's station, he picked up the phone, and asked the 
579 operator for the extension he wanted. The elevator was waiting when he arrived in front of it's 
580 ornate brass doors, with the Cupids in bronze depicting the floor numbers. The operator had been
581 alerted. Another delivery to that bunch of crazies ...He reflected on what a very friendly maid 
582 had told him-"and feathers all over..."
583    The man with the room service cart had an expression that was downright intimidating, and when
584 he told the operator that the car was to go to the "private party", the operator was acquiescent.
585 "Yes sir..." The doors opened just as a tall man with a stunningly beautiful companion was about
586 to rap on the door. "Sir, a delivery, sir..."
587 Delta V pushed the cart towards the door, and the
588 tall man looked at him suspiciously. Feigning intimidation, Delta said "It's the desserts, sir-petit
589 fours, and Nessleroot Tort, and Ambrosia, sir..."
590 The tall man made one of the few mistakes of his life, and raised the white linen cloth to look. 
591    Delta hit him squarely in the jaw, and the tall Albanian veritably flew back, and slammed into
592 the door. The man in the cooks uniform moved in quickly, but not fast enough. A long leg snaked 
593 out, and caught his ankle, smashing forward, and twisting it painfully. His hand went inside his
594 white tunic, and is
595 as if by magic, his hand felt the familliar ribbed handle of the Walther. Squeeze the trigger once
596 and a round is loaded into the chamber. The action is cocked, and ready to fire. As he fell to the
597 plush carpeted floor, he brought the muzzle up so that it was pointed at the tall man, ...,and,..
598 the barrel of an equally intimidating handgun.
599 The woman just stood there, for a second, confused. The two men for the first time made eye contact.
600 Time was stretched to it's outermost limits. Years and years of training was suddenly forgotten 
601 in the face of ones equal. Everything seemed to be in slow motion, and eager fingers squeezed triggers
602 
603 almost as one. Both guns fired within a split second of each other, and both hands were raised an
604 instant before the deafening explosions. Two bullets smashed into walls, inches from human heads.
605 Then, silence. Hesitation... The man on the floor spoke. "Well...Delta V, or I'm a poor goatherder.
606 Delta Five said calmly,"Well, thought I might find you here, Wassir. Sorry about your boat, but 
607 you know how it is....
608                         D                                                 DDD

613         "C'mon pal, give it a rest.  I think it's about time you knocked off for the eveing.  You're cut off."
614         "Oh Stuart, don't be a wet blanket.  Besides, we were just getting started,"  I said as I raised my glass.
615         "We?  What do you mean we?  Your so-called buddy, Mr. Smirnoff, is gone!"  Stuart held up an inverted
616 bottle that was seriously lacking of anything liquid and made certain I was aware of that fact.  "No more
617 liquor, absolutely no other guests to be seen, and it's time I locked this place up."  Stuart didn't seem all
618 too impressed with my company and just slid the tab in front of me while locking up the cabinets behind the
619 counter and generally straightening up things for the person that would get stuck working the first shift the
620 next morning.
621         "You're just doing this because you don't approve of my musical talent.  Would you care to hear an anthem
622 perhaps?  I'm quite up-to-date on several of the more popular European anthems.  Would you care for..."
623         "You have got to be the most verbose customer while inibriated I've heard!  I'm calling you a taxi."
624         "You musn't call me a taxi," I said while looking for my bilfold.  "On the contrary, my name is Lewis."
625 Stuart only issues a simple groan while dialing the number to the taxi service.  He hesitates for a moment when
626 he gazes upon the fountain of wealth I seem to be drawing my monetary assets from at the moment.
627       "Huh?  Oh hello, Northeast Taxi?  Yea, I've got a fellow out here that's had one too many to drink...  And
628 you don't need to worry about the fare, I think this guy must have struck it luck at Bowling-for-Bucks..."
