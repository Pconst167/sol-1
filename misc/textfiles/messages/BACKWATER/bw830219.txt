45 Anyone for discussing politics or religion?

47 I really can't fathom all of the current (and past) discussion over
48 allowing prayer in schools.  For some reason, everyone is talking 
49 about "Christian" prayers.  Many other "heathen" religions also
50 utilize prayers.  How would all of the IMMoral Majority types
51 feel if their precious offspring were forced to pray to Allah or
52 Buddha?  Maybe then they would have a different attitude...

106 ((((((((((((((())))))))))))))))
107 Just saw an article in Infoworld which seems interesting.  Commodore
108 made a deal with Zilog to put Z8000 chips in some new low-end
109 computers.  What's interesting is that a subsidiary of Commodore is
110 MOS Technology, designers of...... the 6502!!!!!   According to the
111 article, the deal obviously squelched the idea of building a 16-bit
112 sequel to the 6502 called the 65000.  You'd normally expect Commodore
113 to go with their subsidiary's designs if they were at all acceptable,
114 so their repudiation of this design series is very significant.
115 	In other words, the 6502 sucks and Commodore knows it.
116 Also, they're not willing to take the chance that the 65000 might
117 flop and leave then in the cold, like the 9900 did to TI.
118 	Someone once said on this system that the fact that the
119 6502 hasn't been updated means its better than Z80 et al.  Phooey.
120 NO chip is so good that it can't stand some improvement.  But it
121 seems only the better chips get improved, since it is a lot more
122 practical to abandon a very poor chip than to try to produce an
123 upward compatible improvement.  
124 ((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))
125 Since you say there aren't any upgraded versions of the 6502
126 what are the differences between a 6502, 6509 & a 6510? (And
127 how do they manage to address (NOT bank switch) more than 64k
128 with some of the above chips?)

138 AMIGO-MONDAY will only run on mondays
139 because its the only computer I have
140 that's equipped to run a BBS and I need
141 it for programming and fun.
142 I see very few other computers in the
143 Atari price range that are even capable
144 of running a BBS at all!
145 ****************************************
146 The 6502 has been upgraded - they just didn't 
147 yell and beat their chest about it:
148 the original 6502 did not have a ROR operand
149 the newer 6502's do.

169 what type of modem is used on this system?
170 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
171 I hear the question "do we need more power?" and some say "no, we get
172 along just fine as we are."
173 To answer this don't ask "what do we do with it?" Ask instead "What DON'T
174 we do with it?" There are a lot of things we don't do, because the current
175 toys just can't. Such as: real home data bases, user friendly, error
176 tolerant programming, inerchangeable graphics, voice, reading printed
177 text, etc. The current operating systems are small because we can't run
178 even UNIX on our home 'computers'. Small programs can not be very flexible.
179 Online dictionaries? A real dictionary has about 1/2 million words, averaging
180 6 or so letters each, so just for one use we need 3 megs, and even though I
181 have a SMALL one on my machine, it is just too sloww, because the machine
182 must go to disc for every word. Wordstar is small potatos compared to some
183 real word processors, but can't get much better, because no one has the
184 space for it. Voice entry exists, but it takes a pretty big machine for
185 even a few words, and the working vocabulary of an educated person isn't
186 a few words, it's several tens of thousands. To read printed text is easy,
187 and it isn't special hardware that stops us, it is the humungus variety
188 of letter shapes, and this merely means big arrays to compare against, and
189 lots of computer power. Last month's Byte had an article on user friendly
190 data entry, but it seems that the thing used about 100 or so k words
191 just for the data entry part, not the actual program.
192    The answer to more power in home computers isn't faster, I'm afraid;
193 it's going to be bigger. A 16 bit machine can do more in less time than
194 an 8 for at least 3 reasons: it handles more data at a time, it has a more
195 powerful instruction set, and it can really use more memory. The limit on
196 the second is the ability of the programmer to understand it, and the last
197 is just plain money, but things are getting cheaper. More powerful computer
198 allow simpler, sloppier programming, more powerful languages, more 
199 complete i/o, online error checking, real operating systems, etc.
200    We ain't seen nothing yet, and we won't until we get MORE POWER.

256    The following are statements taken from actual letters received
257 by the Welfare Department in application for support.
258 
259   I am forwarding my marriage certificate and six children.  I had
260 seven, but one died which was baptized on a half sheet of paper.
261 
262   I am writing the Welfare Department to say that my baby was born
263 two years old.  When do I get my money?
264 
265   Mrs. Jones has not had any clothes for a year and hasbeen visited
266 regularly by the clergy.
267 
268   I cannot get sick pay.  I have six children.  Can you tell me why?
269 
270   I am glad to report that my husband who is missing is dead.
271 
272   This is my eighth child.  What are yoe going to do about it?
273 
274   Please find for certain if my husband is dead.  The man I am
275 now living with can't eat or do anything until he knows.
276 
277   I am very much annoyed to find you have branded my son
278 illiterate..  This is a dirty lie as I was married for
279 a week before he was born.
280 
281   In answer to your letter, I have given birth to a
282 boy weighing ten pounds.  I hope that this is satisfactory.
283 
284   I am forwarding my marriage certificate and my three
285 children, one of which is a mistake as you can see.
286 
287   Unless I get my husband's money pretty soon, I will
288 be forced to leading an immortal life.
289 
290   You have changed my boy to a girl.  Will this make
291 any difference?
292 
293   In accordance with your instructions, I have given birth
294 to twins in the enclosed envelope.
295 
296 
297    I have no children as yet as my husbandi is a truck
298 driver and works days and nights.
299 
300    I want money as quick as I can get it.  I have been
301 in bed with the doctor
302 for two weeks, and he
303 doesn't do hme any cgood.
304  If things don't improve
305 I will have to send for
306 another doctor.
307 
308   My husband ngot his project
309 cut off two weeks ago, and
310 I haven't had cnany relief since.
311 **j***(**********(**************.****************
312 For a BBS try beating the price of an Atari
313 400.  If your system is better than an
314 Atari, why don't you put up a BBS with
315 "good" programs on it -- 7 days a week, 24 hrs/day.
316 (or even 1 day a week).
317 As far as that goes, why don't you quit being
318 a jerk and just ignore the announcement since
319 you really wouldn't be interested in Atari
320 software (your cheap junk machine can't handle it).
321 The announcement was intended for other Atari people
322 and was not expected to be of great interest to
323 other computer owners (there are a few Atari's on-line
324 even though you don't like to admit it).
325 *********************************************************
326 I *DO NOT* understand JERKS that can't be content to keep
327 their mouths shut.  There is an old saying....if you don't
328 have something nice to say, keep your mouth shut.  This
329 is directed to the lowlife who feels he/she has to put
330 down the efforts of other people.  I feel that the more
331 bulliten board systems around, the better.  Who cares if
332 it only runs on Monday, and WHO CARES if it on an Atari,
333 a Radio Shack, or an old RELAY computer...  I think it
334 is pretty nice of people to put their systems up for
335 others to get onto and enjoy!  So - why don't you
336 learn from the old expression - updated a little - IF
337 YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING NICE TO SAY, KEEP YOUR
338 FINGERS OFF THE KEYS!

470 I have just read Byte's review of the Apple IIe. The Apple
471 community has my sympathies. Why? Because now THEY're in for the
472 kind of trouble that the TRS-80 community had when the Model III
473 came out! "Undocumented ROM calls may have been changed..."
474 "Most hardware expansions will still be usable..."
475 (I must admit that Apple did a slighty better job on hardware
476 compatability)
477 "New, Enhanced version - but still compatible with..."
478 	It all sounds SO familiar!
479 But don't worry, even if it isn't always as compatible as you
480 need (Murphy's Law as applied to improvements: The one accessory
481 you want the most is the one that isn't supported!) you're still
482 going to have a BETTER machine! It's gonna hurt at first, but I
483 think you'll like the end result.
484 	(Note: I don't own or want an Apple, and don't really see
485 what you people see in them. But I think that in the long run
486 you'll agree with the above if you DO like Apples!)
