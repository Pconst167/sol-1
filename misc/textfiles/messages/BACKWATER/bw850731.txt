21 L'homme: Yes, I'll be there, the new update has misc fixes in it, nothing
22 important. One thing that was changed was that the OVP file MUST be labeled
23 .OVP now, anything else will be ignored.
24 No Archive disks this time, I haven't had time to convert them, been too busy
25 getting the CL+ ready for release. The first units went out today. (aprox 50
26 units). That along with a last minute bug fix, and the fact that the manuals
27 only came back from the printers last night made it a rather busy day.
28 Voyuer: Also will bring promised disks, plus a few other programs I found
29 kicking around. Did L'homme get you a copy of PC-file? I would give you a
30 copy of PC-write, but it won't run on your machine. I'll be bringing an
31 update for your disk as well to fix that last minute bug that was found.
32 See you there!

41 It was a dark and stormy knight!  The old horse creaked. "C R E A K ! !" it
42 went.  Sir Ben of Fish urged his horse onward.  "Onward, oh mighty Rustbucket!"
43 he cried.  The decrepid horse stumbled forward, its neck straining, trying to
44 go faster.  Then it stopped where it was and fell over, its battery dead.  As
45 Sir Ben of Fish pulled himself out from under the jumbled mess of lifeless 
46 flesh, he cursed the foreign design of his transport.  The horse kicked and 
47 tried to move.  Sir Ben sighed and took out his magical weapon, known in the 
48 legends as an M-16 semi-auto, and finished the horse off.  He cursed the gods 
49 for his bad luck.  Now he would never catch the evil computer hacker,
50 Jeffslime.  The gods took personal offense and cursed him back, only their 
51 curse took effect.  Sir Ben screamed as his skin turned orange and his teeth
52 fell out.  Just then, a giant bird swooped down and picked him up, mistaking 
53 him for a giant worm.  Oh, well.  Better luck in your future life, Sir Ben.

56 Observation:  those people who have Apples seem prone to want to inflict them
57 on those of us intelligent enough to not get them in the first place.  They
58 turn them into BBS's, plug them into 300 (yuuuch!) baud modems, and don't
59 warn the population of their heritage.  Oh, yes, and they write the bbs's in
60 BASIC, and run them off of minifloppies.  SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!

72     
73     I was playing Trolls & Tribulations one day when I realized I wanted
74 to make an exlelent game in ML. In all the other games I had tried to make in
75 ML, I had failed because I found out something I didn't know. But now I was bored playing games andwanted to make my own.
76 So I thought about what kind of game I wanted to make. I thought of a game I had made for the VIC 20 awile ago and 
77 thought about making a better version for the 64. As I thought about that, it turned out that I really didn't want
78 to do that! so I thought of another game. I thought of asteroids where your fighting for your life, but that wasn't the 
79 kind of game I wanted to make. I thought of Donkey Kong and Mario Bros., but that wouldn't do the trick either! Then I 
80 thought about Trolls. That seemed to be kinda what I wanted to make.(kinda)
81 I wanted an adventure game where you weren't fighting for your life, like
82 aAsteroides, or Star Castle, And I wanted a game that you didn't always quite
83 know what to do next. I came up with the idea of a game where your going through a mansion or a castle trying to find 
84 something. But what would you have to find? Treasures? I stayed up all night thinking about it.

93 Cistop: having great 'fun' trying to convince CL+ to talk sociably with my
94 ProModem.  Due partly, no doubt, to the relative complexity of CL, partly
95 to the complexity of the ProModem's options, and probably due a little to 
96 my cable (which is straight thru 1-8,20-22, and doesn't have RTS & CTS tied).
97 For instance - when I CALL BW, it dials, then as soon as it finishes dialing,
98 I get  ++ No answer / Busy ++ & ++ Aborting ++, then I am returned to
99 Command:.  Meanwhile, the call may actually be going through.  I have
100 managed to get it to wait until the ProModem gives up (in 30 seconds) by
101 setting CARC OFF, but that doesn't seem right.
102 The ProModem has a feature (which I think Hayes doesn't) of buffering the
103 data between the modem and the port.  I can leave the port set at 1200 baud,
104 say ATB0, and call BackWater.  The modem will connect at 300, but send the 
105 data to the port at 1200.  In order to work this with the CALL, I had to 
106 Set Mod ATV0B0   (B0 sets modem to 1200, for all the other boards).
107 Then the directory looks like BW,-B1DT230xxxx      CBBS,-DT284xxxx   etc.
108 (the B1 in BackWater's sets the modem to 300, the T seems to be required).
109 What time I've had to spend with CL+ has been spent on such preliminary
110 details, I haven't yet gotten into the more complicated things (log strings,
111 for instance).      I plan on attending Thursday night, but probably won't
112 have much more time to spend on trying stuff on CL+ between now and then.

117      At first look at the so-called "Pell-Mell", Emu was a bit taken aback.
118 He'd never seen a machine quite like this one, especially with the plethora
119 of graphic, uh, graphic *art* decor.  Some of the scenes depicted were very
120 beautiful, some were amusing, and all were, well, graphic.
121      The general shape of the Pell-Mell resembled something to a Mercedes
122 Benz mated to a Mack truck.  The front end had the long, rounded Mercedes look,
123 complete with it's cherub on the radiator.  As you looked further back, the 
124 nose widened out to a boxy, rather large travelling compartment.  It didn't
125 look like the accomodations would be very spacious for four (or five?) tra-
126 velers, but after getting lost in a Tardis several years ago, Emu knew better
127 than to judge size by outward appearance.
128      Emu turned to see what the commotion behind him was all about, and saw
129 Trainor standing back up with Zephyr on his shoulder, looking none too 
130 thrilled.  Just as the breeze picked up, the gathered crowd gasped, and Emu
131 saw what surprized them: Lady Tayree's shawl had blown open to reveal the most
132 beautiful, most skillfully embroidered tunic that Emu had ever the priviledge
133 to see.  Then Emu noticed what had ellicited the loudest gasp.  Zephyr was
134 staring in total terror at the plush rabbit fur that lined the Scarlet Lion's
135 shawl.
136      "This adventure should trully be entertaining, if nothing else," Emu
137 thought to himself.  "With a rabbit who's determined to join us, a guide that
138 can't make the rabbit understand the word `no', Lady Tayree with her rabbit-
139 lined shawl, and our piper getting quite embarrased at these depictions of
140 life's most enjoyable activity."
141      On Piper's suggestion to get going, Trainor touched the left breast of a
142 figure near the door, and the door slid silently aside.  As he motioned the 
143 travellers to enter, they stepped in one by one and looked around.  "Sure
144 enough," Emu thought, "it is larger on the inside."  Though he was good at
145 finding and following paths and trails anywhere else, Emu knew not too try
146 exploring the inner reaches of this machine without a competent guide.
147      At what was the front of the room was a large control panel with two
148 rolling chairs and a wide, closeable viewport.  On the far side of the room
149 was a mural, presumably of Trainor's home planet.  Underneath the mural was the
150 navagational control equipment, primarily for making the jumps Trainor was
151 explaining about earlier.
152      Surrounding the door of the back wall were several environmental suits
153 for humanoid shapes (none small enough for a rabbit) and explorational
154 equipment such as ropes, pickaxes, bus tokens, and jet packs.  The wall behind
155 Emu, through which they had all entered, had another mural, and more of the
156 engravings that seemed to line every corner and door of the Pell-Mell.
157     In the middle of this control room was a contraption that Emu didn't quite
158 recognize.  He turned to ask Trainor about it, but Trainor wasn't inside the
159 machine yet.  At Emu's questioning glance, Tayree said "He's still outside
160 discussing the situation with Zephyr."
161     Piper chuckled, "I'm wondering if Zephyr would really enjoy coming along
162 with us?  After one look at your shawl, I thought he'd bolt away!"
163     "yes, he did seem rather disturbed about it." she answered.  "oh, i do
164 wish they would hurry up.  i'd like us to get on our way."

167   "...i know it must sound a bit precocious, but i have been looking for
168 any such excursion as this to brighten my life.  silly as it may be, i
169 think i could be quite fond of standing on the edge of destruction...
170 teetering between our pleasant existance and sheer calamity."
171   i stopped, fearing that i had been carried away with the notions of
172 grandeur.  lucky for me my voice was not one that carried a great 
173 distance.  stopping to think, now that some of us were inside this
174 dimensionaly transcendental anomaly, i whispered to the companion beside
175 that it was certainly disturbing to find that we would have to look at
176 this man's "etchings" even now that we were inside.
177   removing his burnt fingers from his mouth, he commented.  "his need
178 for our aid is what should stand foremost in our minds.  the plight
179 suffered by an entire people's planet would not be atoned in some 
180 small way if we would but stand by the wayside, only to watch him
181 search for other companions.  and about his taste in, ahem, art, one
182 could always look at the floor..."  and then mumbling before he would
183 return his attention to his hand's momentary distress, "makes me kind
184 of wonder if we're banding together with some dirty old man..."
185   i only chuckled.

188    As I sat on Trainor's shoulder, the Dimensional Traveller spoke, saying 
189 "Zephyr, I know you want to come and all but I really don't think that...."
190    I interrupted, saying in a sursrising louder tone than my usual quiet voice
191    "But I am coming.  I really want to help, Trainor. " my whiskers fluttered
192 in irritation "I want to help.  I know that a small rabbit like myself isn't 
193 the greatest thing you can xhave on your quest, but I still want to come.  I 
194 have a mneed to go forth and see other thigs and other places, as well as meet
195 people I' ve never dreamed possible.  To see other worlds is something had
196 dreams about for all my lifetime." I lookd expectantly at the Trainor, hoping
197 that he'D let me come.  
198    Silently, nearly knocking me over, the Trainor noddedd.  My heart beat 
199 aster as the excitement of fulfilling mttuy one true dream was within my grasp at last.  
200   I thAnked him again and again, joyful that I was going to *go* somewhere for 
201 a change, rather than stay where I was foever. 
202    The Trainor turned around, and entered the incredibly wonderfully 
203 designed device that was the Pell-Mell, with me riding on his shoulder all the 
204 while.

215 I had come up with a great idea for a game! Your going through a castle
216 trying to find the key out. First, you have to find the key for the wizards
217 tower. Once you've done that, you go into the wizards tower where you'll find
218 a map of the castle. It will show all the rooms and which room has the key out.
219 Also, you pour a magic liquid on your candle so theh key will glow when your in
220 the right room. You get the key and go out.
221 My only problem was that I was terrible with graphics! So I asked my 
222 older sister for help and she designed the floor plans. But I needed graph paper to map it on. 
223 
224        After about a week I got gobs and gobs of graph paper and started mapping the rooms. 
225 That took a lot of time! It took me 5 days to maypa all the rooms. and I started 
226 poking it in to memory. It took 8000 bytes for each screen and I got discourged
227 ! Finely I stopped and tried to think of an easier way to do it.

238   Cragmore had been silent up to this point, for he wished no other to take
239 exception to his presence. Finally though, after witnessing the rabbit Zepher's
240 illegal and unsolicited use of mind control on Trainor, he could stand no more.
241 Cragmore was a sensitive. He could feel the shifts and eddies in the web of
242 psychic fluxes. He knew Zepher was breaking the laws of the Inn when he forced
243 Trainor to stop sneezing and then consent to take the rabbit along. Cragmore
244 was angry that one creature would resort to such dirty and dark tactics to
245 get its way. He spoke loud and clear his inclinations:
246   "No more Zepher! You will not use your forces on these good people. They have
247 made their minds up. You will NOT go along on this adventure. Who can trust one
248 like you to not use your power at any time, for your own benefit, and not that
249 of the mission!"
250   Cragmore got the attention he had shielded himself from before. All the
251 adventurers turned his way, especially Zepher, who's small face betrayed
252 great fear of one who had seen through the mind control trick. No one spoke.
253 No one moved. Cragmore spoke again.
254   "Ahhhh little evil one, do not try your skills on me. Not only and I sensitive
255 to the touch of the mind, but I can block its use as well!"
256   Zepher let out a yelp, and jumped from the shoulder of the dazed Trainor. A
257 menacing look from Cragmore caused the small animal to scurry to and fro on
258 the metal floor of the Pell-mell. The other adventurers were wise now, and they
259 began chasing the rabbit around the ship. Finally Zepher made his way to the
260 open door of the Pell-mell, and jumped to the ground outside the Inn.
261   "You can't follow us Zepher! There is no way to track a reality machine. Do
262 NOT try to catch us. Anything you say will be held as the smallest trite. Now
263 close the door good crewmen, and let us begone from this place.!"
264   Cragmore had a way with words, and his words were followed to the letter.
265 The adventurers, some of who had not even been introduced yet, sat at the
266 nearest available station, as Trainor, with Piper and Emu assisting, made
267 preparations. Switches were thrown, dials set, and the ship was off. Slowly
268 it began to fade from the scene at Inisfal, and in a second, nothing remained
269 but a very small rabbit, and a memory of what had been here just seconds
270 before.

286 Cistop Mikey:  PLEAse.  I'd REALLY appreciate it if you DELETED the above

289 :::::=====:::::=====:::::=====
290    Just as the Pell-Mell sped off, and the surprised rabbit looked off into
291 the sky, the Trainor's mind cleared of the mental control that had been placed
292 on him by Cragmore.  "Quickly, Trainor, if it is possible to do in a Pell-elMell,
293 please turn around." said the Scarlett Lion.  Trainor nodded and fiddled with
294  what seemed to be the centrol control
295 board, and they were once again back at thd Inn.  The door opened, as Scarlett
296 on saw the cute little bunny crying on the cold, wet, ground.  Scarlett Lion 
297 picked the rabbit up and stroked his back, trying to make this whole escapade
298 be forgotten by the bunny.  
299   "Never....try txhat again!" said an angered Trainor, who was upset that
300 someone so small and defensless would be chased about and thought to be evil
301 by this Cragmore, who none of them knew and who had most likely taken control of them and ordered them to close 
302 the door on the bunny.  
303   "Thank you, good people." said Zephyr, his infectuious smile warming all of the
304 party members.
305   "What should we do about him?" asked Emu, pointing to the glaring and annoyed Cragmore.
306   "Zephyr was the accused, so Zephyr decides." said Trainor.
307   "If he wants to come with us so be it.  He was misguided into thinking I was
308 evil, and I don't think that someone should be unished BECAUSE THE Y WERE **WRONG***  about something, so let him
309 come!"

328 stupid enough to buy apples do things at 300 baud then what the heck are you
329 doing on this 300 baud only system?   and apple boards are only as slow as
330 their sysops.  the board i have written is like bmws, save all the little
331 commands that i don't know how to use.  the board doesnt spend all of it's
332 time writting files to disks, printing nifty messages on the screen or any
333 fool thing like that. all the saving it does do is at the end of the day
334 and even then its saved onto a ram drive - hardly noticable.   apples are
335 slow, sure, but we work with what we have.  im not sorry for what i do
336 have, its better then nothing. and if other people just couldnt stand calling
337 it why should they?  anyone who doesnt wat to call doesnt have to, anyone that
338 does can and not have to pay for anything.  if you just cant understand ill
339 call ya up with 2400 baud and we can chat.

364      First, I wanted it at 8192. I could set the address (8192) in zero page and increment it. The way a bit mapped
365 screen was set up it went "8192-8199 step 1" then it went (8192+320 $2000+$140)
366 I had to do was add $40 to peek $FB and if that "wraped around" past zero INC$FC then increment peek $FC anyway.

422     Most other continuing stories that I've seen on this board don't ever
423 have such conflicting viewpoints as the one that has been started by 
424 Trainor.  Usually, once something has been written, no one argues with it,
425 and simply continue the story from there.  The individual writers have 
426 control over they're own characters, and *limited* control over the other
427 characters.  This is called common courtesy.
428     When this courtesy is ignored by one person and that person begins to
429 be a pest and force a story to go in his/her direction *only*, with no
430 regard to other's wishes, that person has opened him/herself to *lots* of
431 complaints, criticism, and otherwise nasty comments.
432     I don't like reading those comments, not to mention writing them myself,
433 but it has become apparent that something needs to be said.  Zephyr, *please*,
434 let us continue our story without anymore fuss.  You have made yourself known
435 to all over the past few months, and we are getting tired of your forceful
436 inclusions.  And please, I don't think our friendly Cystop will do a whole
437 lot for you if you keep crying to him for deletions.  I personally hope he
438 leaves them there as a testement to your writing.
439     Trainor: may we continue where we left off?  I beleive that we had just
440 taken off with a new arrival, who seems to be well trained in mentalics...

443    Opon reaching the door he stopped, and sat down slowly on the stoop.  He
444 watched the small group mill around the machine.  There seemed to be a bit of
445 discord within the group, and now was not the time to go forward.  It dod not
446 however disturb him to see it.  Adventures never get along.  It is their 
447 difference that make it interesting.  A group that has all motives in common
448 tends to fall into a boring cycles quickly.  He could not think of a story
449 of much worth that the heros all got along.
450   He had always liked stories with heros.
451   
452   Maybe now was a good time for an adventure.
453 [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] THE TIN MAN
454 Tin Man: Zephyr might have been welcome at one time. Or he might have been 
455 able to convince us that he was an asset. Unfortunately, he instead chose
456 to manipulate other people's *main* characters, in a manner that went far
457 beyond the limits of courtesy & propriety. The last straw for a number of
458 people was when he had Trainor "consent" to take him along. 
459 	Trainor doesn't like having someone else making *decisions for his
460 character.  I'm not going to allow someone with so little regard for other
461 people's characters to be in a story with me (assuming he gives me any 
462 choice). Several others are of a similar opinion. The only way he could
463 have been more impolite would be to start a story and start using our 
464 characters after we had said we didn't want to go! 
465 	There has been only one other instance of 're-writing history'
466 on BWMS. That was during the McKane-Net conflict. It almost killed *both*
467 organizations. 
468 Zephyr: Please stop trying to FORCE others to bow to your wishes. If you
469 continue, you will force us to abandon the first good adventure in quite
470 some time. I have heard a number of suggestions regarding what might be
471 done if you continue to 'run' other people's characters. All of them are
472 rather extreme. I hope it doesn't have to come to that...
473 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
474 	This was getting ridiculous. Reality seemed to be shifting badly
475 from moment to moment. Bard could not be certain which of the three
476 figures was responsible. But it had to be one of them. Since they were
477 all busy arguing, he was able to motion the others out of the line of 
478 fire.
479 	He reached into his pack and removed several devices. He clipped
480 the reality stabilizer to his belt. He then donned the psi-shield. Finally,
481 he raised the Assualt shotgun, moved the fire selector to full-auto, and
482 spoke:
483 	"Alright! THAT'S ENOUGH!" he yelled. Zephyr, Trainor, and the 
484 pyshic (Cragmore?) turned and found themselves looking at a *very* angry
485 Bard. "We are going to settle this NOW! Someone is playing games with
486 other people's minds. Possibly even playing at reality shifts. You know
487 who you are... you've got 30 seconds to admit it and leave... "
488 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
489 All: this is not as extreme as most of the suggestions... And I wouldn't
490 make any bets as to whether or not Bard is bluffing...
491 (hmm, lessee, on full auto, the whole clip goes, and with double-ought buck
492 loads (12 gauge shotgun) we'd need a sponge...)(I'd *hate* to mess up the
493 lawn)
494 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
495 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
496   Released from the dizzying shifts of reality, the piper sank exhausted,
497 to his knees.  The Bard's shout brought his attention back from his own
498 concerns.  Somehow, the Bard had been spending time on a higher technology
499 plane again -- the weapon held in his hands bore mute (at the moment)
500 testimony to the efficiency of the culture that had produced it.  Short
501 and deadly, it held the look of deadly meanace.  Even the slight odor
502 of gun oil that wafted from it's finely-crafted mechanism spoke, as did
503 the "snick" of the fire-control lever, of the destruction waiting to 
504 leap from the muzzle.  
505 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
506 :::::=====
507 Trainor:  Sorry.  Didn't know you would mind if I said I could come.  
508 Didn't think you didn't want me.  I guess my character isn't very 
509 good, but I thought someone "on your shouldre giving friendly advice
510 sommetimes." would be interesting, and besides, the shawl incident
511 was a hillarious oppourtunity which I couldn't pass up.  I had to 
512 come along and oet some words in with the Scarlett Lion about that 
513 shawl.  You don't really want to leave someone behind who wants to 
514 go, after all, this WAS an open adventure, and if you can take a 
515 person who JUMPS out of the blue, then why can't you take me]?
516 :::::=====
517    BArd held the gun up to Zephyr and then to Trainor, then to Cthe
518  being known as Cragmore. 
519 (Whoops. forgot first person, ch Zephyr to I)
520    "Ok... I was the one who manipulated Trainor in order to go.  
521 But it was because..." my whiskers twitched "My DREAM has allways been 
522 hisk off into other places and SEE things.  Emu, Piper, Bard, Scarl
523 Lion, TRainor Cragmore, I am truely sorry that this ever happened.  I didn't
524 want to be left out, I had been for so long, and it hurt.  My life is short, so I want to DRAEM and FEEL!" I said
525 as a crystally tear fell from my left eye. 
526   "Can I still go?  I'll never do it aagain! Honest!"
527 :::::=====:::::
528 Trainor:  Better???  I didn't manipulate you nor Piper, Emu, Bard, Cragmore, or 
529 The Scarlett Lion.  So can I come??

531 (*{(*{(*{(*{(*{(*{l'oeuf}*)}*)}*)}*)}*)}*)
532   As Fencer and his caninie companion travelled south, along a long-forgotten
533 path, in search of the magical, mystical, caloric Savoy Truffle, he felt a
534 shift in the fabric of reality.  Sensing dangerous vibes and excitement, he
535 beat a hasty path back to the lawn of the Inn.  What he saw there was indeed
536 something exciting- a gadget. A rather large gadget.  This one was actually
537 a mid-sized gadget, and as Fencer stood on the dewy lawn he heard a scuffle
538 from inside of this vehicle- was this the Pell-Mell that Trainor had spoken
539 of? - and walked around one corner of the vehicle just in time to see a small
540 furry thing tossed out the doorway.  Zephyr? Was that the rabbit Zephyr? Who
541 could be sure of anything in these surroundings?  Just then, Fencer detected
542 *another* shift in the fabric...only this time when his senses had cleared,
543 there was a burnt spot in the lawn, a whooping/sputtering sound, apperently
544 from the machine that had just dissapeared, and a small, fuzzy, melancholy
545 lagmorph who was now sitting on his hind legs, watching the burnt spot.
546    The man and his dog, along with the rabbit, sat there on the wet lawn,
547 feeling unreal.  Then, another shift took place, only this one had a smell
548 to it- that of dirty laundry- upon reentry into the reality zone.  A gowned
549 figure stepped out, picked up the rabbit, and started to return to the 
550 vehicle.  Enough of this, Fencer thought, I don't need all those calories,
551 anyway.  Knocking on the metallic outer covering of the strange gadget, he
552 shouted over the din from the inside- "Permission to come aboard requested,
553 sir!"

557    Man is a fragile being. His biological functions are but a small part of his
558 total essence. The mind and the spirit are the cardinal factors in his
559 existence. Trainor slumped against an ornate bulkhead, covering up another
560 scene of deep expression that was held so dear in his homeland. But his home-
561 land was gone now, and it was up to him and a group of adventurers to try to
562 right that which was wrong with the Universe. No one in the known realities
563 had the ability to bring back the dead, and Trainor knew this. T`e small band
564 of people did have the ability to prevent innocent lives from being lost.
565 What greater good could they do?
566    Trainor's head pounded, still aching from psi attacks and verbal shoving
567 matches. He found it difficult to speak, but speak he must, for the nature
568 of this adventure, hence the balance of the whole universe hung on the
569 success or failure of what he wanted to undertake.
570    "I am nearly at a loss for words. The events in the past day have depleted
571 my body as well as my soul. I have seen much of Reality, but never have I
572 witnessed such things as I have seen here. My friends, who have done so much to
573 aid me in my quest, I have nothing but gratitude and respect for all of you.
574 It is a difficult thing when it turns out the greatest enemy is ourselves. But
575 on we must go. The bickering, the mind control, the battle that rages before
576 we even meet our black foe has worn me, but in doing so made me more resolute
577 than ever!"
578    At this last exclamation Trainor rose to his feet, and looked into the
579 experienced but expectant eyes around him. "Zepher, you have broken tradition
580 that has stood long and hard here in the realities. You have played a game
581 with other characters that no one should ever play. Your eagerness has cost
582 you the respect of the people you see around you. I don't know how our group
583 could function with such memories, regardless of what promises are made. I am
584 not fond of telling you that I think in everyone's interests you should not
585 go along with us in our Pell-mell, but I feel within me that I must. Perhaps
586 we will meet in another reality or on another plane, when you have grown and
587 perhaps even evolved into a new character with a fresh future and the knowledge
588 and maturity hopefully gained today locked away in your memory. Do not become
589 angry and lash out at those around you. Think about my words. They were
590 chosen with care so you might benefit from them. I do not fancy myself as
591 a great philosopher, but I hope some clarity rings through, and you are the
592 better for it. Good bye friend. And remember, there is always another time
593 and another place. I have found that the magic of this Inn lies in its infinite
594 possibilities....."
595    Trainor's words were cut off by the whoosh of the Pell-mell door closing.
596 The rabbit was left sitting a few feet away from the machine. His ears
597 wiggled at the sound of the Pell-mell departing once again for parts-unknown.
598 Hopefully Zepher realized that no malice was meant by the actions of the
599 others. It was the best for all that they part ways, at least for the time
600 being.
601    "Again places everyone. Bard, will you help me in the control room? Companions, we head for my homeland. I want
602 you to see for yourself the destruction the being we are after is capable of perpetrating."
603     Apparently Trainor did not notice the new character who had joined in the adventure. The other inn-goers knew
604 him as Fencer, but the time for introductions would have to wait until later.
