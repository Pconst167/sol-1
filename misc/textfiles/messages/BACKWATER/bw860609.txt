20 Mikey:
21 I've been checking prices on the parts for the board. There sure is a lot of
22 variation. Only two ads list 1771's. One wants $15.95, the other $4.95!

29     "That will be $40.90 sir." The desk clerk smiled as Parity reached for
30 his wallet and handed over two twenties and a one-spot.
31     "Keep the change." smiled the agent.
32     "Oh no sir, this could be your lucky dime. You ought to try it in one of
33 our slot machines." returned the clerk.
34     "Come on Parity," continued Fellows, standing behind Parity and carrying
35 the CD/ROM case, "give it a try. One never knows, does one?"
36     "Of course, 'one' never knows. Sure I'll take the dime. Thank you very
37 much for your kind service."
38     "My pleasure. I hope you enjoy your stay at the Westward Ho."
39 
40     "Slot machines, eh? What a colossal waste of money Fellows. Do you 
41 realize the chances of winning anything are..."
42     "Astronomical Parity. Which is precisely why you should try. Hey, what's
43 one stinkin' dime anyway?"
44     Parity shrugged. "OK, lead the way, oh gambler of the west."
45 
46     The two agents walked past one set of slot machines. "What about these?"
47 Parity asked.
48     "No, not yet. We want the slots on the other side of the casino. They
49 recently redid this place you know. It's at least three times as big as it
50 used to be." 
51     "Now wait a minute Fellows. I thought you hadn't been here in awhile. On
52 the plane you said..."
53     "On the plane I said I hadn't tried to fill an inside straight in awhile,
54 I never said anything about other forms of easy money."
55     "Easy money? Fellows, I think we need to have a talk. This gam..."
56     "Not now OK? Besides, I want a drink."
57 
58     Parity could not believe his eyes. Sitting in the middle of the casino
59 was a large fountain. Champagne instead of water flowed through its intricate
60 works. Dipping glasses were neatly arranged on a white linen-covered table
61 next to the fountain.
62     "Partake Parity!" Fellows motioned towards the fountain. Parity obliged,
63 got a glass, dipped it in the fountain, swirled the champagne in the glass
64 the prescribed amount, and took a sip. 
65     "Well? How it is? Never thought champagne from a fountain could taste
66 so good?" By this time, Fellows had also readied a glass and was now drinking.
67     "Hmmm." Parity wrinkled up his noes and took another sip. "Oh, it IS
68 passable, just not up to what I'm used to. But rest assured it is the best
69 champagne I've ever had from a fountain. Leave it to Las Vegas to have such
70 a contraption."
71     "Come on, the slots are over this way, next to CA-fae." Fellows took 
72 Parity by the arm and pulled him along. While walking, Parity spied one of
73 the many high-stakes blackjack tables.
74     Blackjack, Parity thought to himself.
75 
76     "Finally, here we are." Twenty slot machines lined the wall just outside
77 the entrance to the main casino. A fancy eatery, CA-fae, complete with
78 latticed walls, attractive tilework, ceiling fans, and lots of ferns stood
79 to the left of the slot machines.
80     "After you spend your dime, we'll go get something to eat."
81     Parity picked a machine that was not occupied, gave the sack containing
82 Ian's belongings to Fellows, rubbed his hands together, put the dime in the
83 slot, and pulled the handle. The machine displayed the message "Easy Come,
84 Easy Go" on its electronic screen for just a second, then the digital wheels
85 began to spin.
86     <LEMON>.....<LEMON>.....<BAR>
87     "Sorry Parity, you lost." Fellows grinned.
88     "So did Ian, Fellows. Listen, I know what you are trying to do. But I don't
89 need it. We have to report in. We have to find out what happened to Ian. We
90 have to find out what happened. We have to get into that bloody ROM case. This
91 little excursion through casino gambling land is just wasting time!"
92     Fellows could see by the look on Parity's face that he was serious. "Sorry
93 Parity. I was just trying to..."
94     "I know that. And I'm sorry to for blowing up. But we have business to do,
95 and time wasted is time lost." Fellows gave back the sack to Parity.
96     "To the room then Parity? We can have room service send something up."
97     "Sure, that sounds fine. Then we can crank up the COMSET and send a
98 message to HQ. This is a gawd-awful message to send too."
99     "I know Parity. I know."

111 It was a cold dark night when reality finally caught up with the individual.
112 Many things were thought that night, many dark and un speakable items were
113 exchanged in the darkened house.  Was the last six months nothing but a
114 dream?  Was it good, or evil?  Will we survive?  They may.  I will not.
115 At least not in this context.  The end of an era in his life had been
116 reached.  As the previous era's had ended, this one was just an painful.
117 With the closing of July, into the dusty journals of history and our 
118 memories will pass the days that we were together.  The fun that we had,
119 the sorrow, and the joy.  The future will be ours, but not together.
120 Remember me with happy thoughts, for that is how I will remember you.

136 ----------You know me for who I am------------------------------
137      The passing of the septade was something that went by
138 smoothly.  Three years later, time seemed to be a menace.  "How
139 old I feel" was the theme of the day.
140      Now another year has passed and the grimace of the twisting
141 calendar digs yet another notch into the ego.  I too feel the
142 passage though I am not at the same point, yet, towards the next
143 septade.
144      Those in cahrge run the risk of disdainment.  Many shall
145 remember the times and the efforts expended with satisfaction; I
146 know I shall.  If my companion, the indigo canine, could but
147 speak he would recount none but the joyous times.  (Even though
148 the companion had been absconded with, that was a joyous time as
149 well.)
150      Resentments have long since past.  Say hello to my Queen's
151 father, the Colonel... Or any of her sisters.  Her name is
152 missed, although her name here is always missed - even if not
153 the same in person...

157   Sometimes grief leaves us rather numb -- with the emotional equivalent
158 of the pins and needles feeling that sitting too long in one position
159 gives a leg.  Right now I'm in that kind of a condition, missing a kind
160 and beautiful friend from a previous part of my life.  She was always 
161 kind and cheerful, even when she was filled with pain she held it back,
162 not wanting to inflict it on others.  The operation helped for a while--
163 she submitted to the indignity of the little bag with resignation, but
164 you could tell it wasn't easy.  Somewhere, somehow, a few marauding
165 rebel cells were missed by the knife.  Deep within her they flourished
166 and grew, a grim travesty of life that gradually leached her life away
167 leaving a nearly transparent husk.  She did not die in a hospital.  She
168 chose to go home, surrounded by family and friends, to breath her last
169 in air free of disinfectants.  She's gone now.  There's an odd shape
170 hole in my heart, and my eyes are finally blurring with the tardy
171 tears that have hesitated so long.

178 
179 We (Michael Hopcroft and myself.) are looking for people to play a new role

182 leave me a messgage on this board. You
183 could also leave me messages on the Atari boards(if you have acsess.) Sorry

196 If a relativly infrequent user of your
197 system is allowed to complain, I feel
198 that a supposed public board should
199 only have messages on it that one could
200 have at least a glimmering of what
201 the message is about. I really don't
202 think coded messages have any place
203 here on backwater. Why not start your
204 own board with all coded messages. That
205 way only bona fide members would only
206 have acsess.

221 Mike: the drive motor comes on and stays on. Drive select light never comes
222 on. Also, I get nothing but gibberish from the terminal port (but it looks 
223 like the speed select trace has been cut, I'll have to check and see if it
224 is really at 300 baud.)

226 ***************************************************************************
227 The drive motor is always on on the SAIII, So that is good. The select
228 light should only come on when the head is loaded to read a sector from 
229 the disk. Did you find the format command? If you are getting gibberish,
230 then you most likely are at the wrong baud rate.

262 Well Hi everybody!!! I just thought
263  I would drop back in and tell you that I just 
264 got back from my trip to Calif....I mean Libya!  Ya, ya, I had to go talk to K
265 hadafy about the situation of things around here.  Why, old Momar and I had a 
266 great time.  We sat in on a jam session with The Rolling...or was it...ya, ya.
267 ..Luciano Pavoratti and James Brown, it was great!!!  Ron probably didn't know
268  that Momar plays one hell of a sax when he bombed him.  So anyway, I go to ge
269 t back on the plane, and I remember I left my accordian.. Er..uh... I mean my 
270 drum set back at Mo's house, and I head back to get it when I see this strange
271  thing in the shape of a cigar or a saucer..I think...Ya, that's the ticket...
272  a saucer.  It dropped down out of the sky and !!POW!!  I was back home in Tex
273 as trying to figure out how I was going to break even in the oil business with
274 all these Saudis trying to horn in on my business.  So I give Ron a call and 
275 say, "Ron, baby, I need some help here."  He tells me that he will personally 
276 give the saudis hell.  Why he even said he might drop a bomb on them...ya, tha
277 t's the ticket!  A big bomb.  Then all their oil would be sucked into outer sp
278 ace.  After I got off the phone with him, my wife Farrah...er uh Morgan...ya! 
279 Morgan Fairchild, my wife, she walks in and brings me some coffee and we have 
280 a nice chat about astro-physics and the aspects of angular entropy.  So next t
281 hing I know, the guys from Genesis are on the phone and I have to conference-c
282 all them with the boys from Kiss.  What a mess.  All they wanted to know was w
283 hen I was going to gig with them next.  So I asked Morgan where my daughter, B
284 rook... I mean Allie Sheedy, was and Morgan said she went out with some friend
285 s from school -- something about a nuclear reactor.  I thought next I had bett
286 er give my friend Delorean a call and who answers the phone but Mr. Ferrari!  
287 So I asked Enzo how he was doing and he told me that the two of them were work
288 ing on a new super car and that I could have the first few that rolled off the
289  line.  So now aobut all I have to do is get this Space Shuttle mess straighte
290 ned out and... oops, Morgan needs me so I had better go, I forgot that we were
291  having the Bhagwan and Charles and Dianna over for dinner.  So have a good on
292 e, and I'll get back to you after the upcomming in-space heart transplant I wi
293 ll be doing.

300 Strange and bizarre proceedings on BW.  Nothing unusual.  
301 Well, Finals are over and now I have time to the stuff I want to.  Isn't it interesting how college affects people?
302 Most of them spend finals week cloistered in with their books, stressing out when it's beautiful outside, and if they
303 don't know their stuff by then, then they might as well forget it, as it does no good to cram for a test.  
304 The nice thing about college is that you meet so many interesting people and make some very good friends in the process
305 of learning one's subject.  I could almost spend my whole life on campus, 'Doorways in the Sand' style, but with a 
306 different motive.  Also, does anyone know of any good electronic music artists similar to Jarre and Schulze in his
307 Transfer Station Blue.  Well, it's time to retire and combat insomnia.

373     "Of what?"

375   "What is the beast?"
376    "I don't know.  I think it's a
377 g."
378    "Why are you afraid of a dog at
379 age twelve?"
380     "Because it's not ONLY a dog."
381   "O.K.  On the count of three, you
382 ll wake up.  O.K?"
383     "O.K..."

464 It seems alright to my Atari though. I kinda have to guess where 80 columns

472 "Yes?" said Farley, looking through a rack of CDs and occasionally muttering
473 under his breath, "...Dawn Patrol, Midnight Madness, Seven Wishes..."
474 "How far are you?"
475 "I'm looking at the N's right now.  Any luck in the clearance section?"
476 "I dunno."  Garret held up a brightly packaged album.  "Want a Slim Whitman

478 Farley grimaced.  "I'll pass."
479 James put the record back, kept searching.  "What are we looking for, again?"
480 "Something strange.  Anything out of place, odd, weird..."
481 "Well, I've found something strange."

547 - Once  again,  the  Scottish Tartans Society reminds  us  that
548 - Tuesday,  July 1st,  is Tartan Day,  the 204th anniversary of
549 - the  lifting of the proscription against the wearing  of  the
550 - tartan. An appropriate day for wearing _your_ tartan...
551   As I foresee no wedding days in the near future, I think it's

560 You are a beautiful person, both inside and out; let no man forget that, for

609 How interesting. I sent a telepathic
610 order for the Entropy reversing ritual.
611 Unfortunatly, when I tried it it turned
612 out to be an Entropy AMPLIFYING ritual.
613 There is now a large hole in the ground
614 where my house used to be and my age
615 was tripled in a matter of seconds.
616 I have complained to the appropriate
617 authorities and I am promised that
618 action will be taken against the person
619 who left the ad above. They have
620 given me a 3-D spell to cast upon the
621 offending parties. Dandruff, Diareeah,
622 and defenestration. 
623 
624 
625 OMIGOD! Not Diareeah (sic). It is always amusing to see the effects of a mis-
626 spelled spell. One time back in 1036 I witnessed such an occasion. A wizened
627 old coot was going to send a young upstart mage back whence he came. He spelled
628 out "Return to thy wold, oh destoyer of too worlds. Thou hast chastized their
629 intellegent transmition enought!" Needless to say, the result was spectacular.
