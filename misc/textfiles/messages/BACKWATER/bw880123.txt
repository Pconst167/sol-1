 25 Hellooooo out there......looks awfully empty around here.  I've been
 26 awfully busy lately (two jobs!), so I haven't had much time to chat.
 27 I am, however, not dead yet.  Justin & Co. -- how's life at Midguard?
 28 Bob says to call and come down any Saturday (and I suspect that you
 29 could make arrangements for a Sunday if that is better);  he'd sure
 30 like to see you!  As would I, but my only free time in the world is
 31 on alternate Monday nights, any Friday or Saturday night, and ALL
 32 DAY Sunday (oh boy, a day off!).  --------  ***Cassandra***
 33  
 34 Question for all you techies and futurist-types out there ----
 35 What advances in technology that are here right now on the cutting
 36 edge, or extremely likely in the near future (5-15 years) that you
 37 believe will have the greatest impact on society?  Now for the tricky
 38 part:  Factor in economic and social pressures (e.g. -- human cloning
 39 is relatively likely to be possible, but will not likely happen, 
 40 especially for the average individual, due to ethical, social, and
 41 economic considerations).  Also, what socio-political happenings do
 42 you think are likely in the next 5-15 years?  Third World War?
 43 Economic collapse?  (Multi-National) Business as usual?  Political
 44 take-over by the right wing (left wing, communists, terrorists, or
 45 any othe"ists" you can think of)?  Nothing?  Mickey Mouse elected
 46 as President?    Okay, so you've got the idea...your vision of the near
 47 future in 100 lines or less.  Remember, I was a (relatively) adult
 48 human being before the micro-computer revolution, a VCR in (almost)
 49 every home, and the advent of CD's.  I was in high school when micro-
 50 waves entered our lives.  And I'm only twenty-five!  Look back and
 51 reflect on how our lives have changed in the last 10 years.  Think
 52 about the social effects of the "new right", AIDS, and SDI.  Okay,
 53 folks...do you really think the world will stand still for our 
 54 convenience?  Like ancient mariners, we need not only to look back
 55 on where we have be, but to chart our future course and change the
 56 heading if we find that we are on a collision-course with disaster.
 57 Enough of thione's ramblings...now take the ball and run with it.

 63   
 64  The room was dimly lit, soft music and a delicate purfume filled the air.  I 
 65 sat and gazed into the beautiful eyes of the Woman sitting befor me.  She sm-
 66 iled at me as she set her coffee cup down.  Her lo, black hair seemed to catch 
 67 all the light in the room and reflect it back.  I could not tell if it was the 
 68 darkness pf her hair that made her skin seem so pale or if was naturally light.
 69 To me, though, her most striking feature was her eyes, they were a copperish 
 70 colour.
 71   "What is it?" she asked with a voice cristal.
 72   "Hum, what?" I said, being snapped back to reality.
 73   "You look absolutly spaced out."
 74   "Drugs," I smiled and sipped my wine, "Too much or not enough, I havn't 
 75 figured it out yet."
 76   She began to laugh a little then slumped down a little.
 77   "Something wrong?"
 78   She smiled at my concerned.
 79   "Just a little...hungry I guess." she smiled weekly.
 80   "Then order some food." I suggested, "I'll even pay..."
 81   "So chivalrus," her eyes sparkled as she smiled at me, "But sum hungers run 
 82 deeper at times..."

161  "..sometimes a hunger runs deep, deep down, down in the soul." she said
162 in a near poetic tone, "But thaat's when one shuld stay hungry."
163   "Some times,my love, youcane be enigmatic," she smiled at that, "too enigmati

166   The rest of our stay in the coffee house was scilent, broken occasionally by 
167 the waitress checking to see if we needed anything else.  Trying to earn a big-
168 ger tip by being anoying.
169  
171   She had finished he coffee long befor i finished my wine.  She just sat there
172 looking at me with eyes that haunted and comforted my mind.  It seemed to me 
173 that a diologue was maintained for those fifteen minutes that we sat there and 
174 said nothing.  
175   We both stood up at the same time.  She walked toward me and we embraced for
176 several moments.
177   I paid the bill and we headed out the door.
178   "Would you mind taking me home rather than dancing?" she asked as we headded 
179 for the car, "I'm not feeling all that well."
180   "Why didn't you say so sooner?"
181   "I didn't want to wreck your evening." was her reply, "Besides it hit me ra-
182 ther suddenly."
183   "Home it is, then."
184   I opened her door for her and closed it after she got in.  She slid over and 
185 unlocked my door.  We kissed and headded off into the night.
186  
187 ...............................................................................
188  
189   It was only a short drive to the apartment where she lived, but it seemed 
190 longer.  I did not mind the fact that she was so quiet, in fact i was beginning
191 to find my self.....aroused, somehow, something in the air.....
192  
193   We pulled into the car-park and i pulled into the nearest visitor's slip to 
194 her apartment.  I felt her hand on mine as touched the ignition switch.
195 I looked over at her and saw that she was slightly smilling.
196   "I'll walk myself up to-night," she said then kissed my cheak.  After she
197 closed her door a heared a rapping on the window.  I turned to look and saw her
198 (still smilling) waiving slightly.  Her pace to her door wasn't too fast, when 
199 she reached the top of the stairs she turned and waived again.
200   I backed out and headded home.

399      Now a hunter is generaly thought of as a harvester of wild protien,

401 of a temple is often of a slightly nother sort: a harvester of knowledge.  Par-

454    I walked to the bathroom, showered, shaved, made myself look human.  I didn'
455 lie to the boss when I told him I felt like shit.  I couldn't stop thinking 
456 about her, I wanted her.  My longing for her made me feel so alone, so...
457   The phone rang while I was getting dressed.
458   "Hello?
460   "Help me..."
461   It was her.  She was breathing heavily and her voice sounded so weak.
462   "What is it?  What' wrong?"
463   "I need you...."
464   "Where are you?"
465   "Home...Hurry"
466   I droped the phone, grabbed a shirt and my keys and flew out the door.
467   I could smell the rubber from my tires as a left my drive-way.  After ignor-
468 ring several stop lights I decided I would be of more help to her alive..
469  
470   My car came to a screaching hault infront of the apartment complex.  My knee
471 decided that this would be a good time to give out, so I hobbled up the steps 
472 to her apartment.  The door opened as I knocked.  Rushing in, I saw her, on the
473 floor in the featal position, clutching the phone and mumbling "please hurry"
474 into it.

562   I rushed to her side and rolled her anto her back.  Her skin was pale, nearly
563 white, and her shirt was drenched in sweat.  Again it was her eyes that grabbed
564 attention.  They were yelloed and almost glowed.  I felt myself shiver for a 
565 second then almost lost total controll when she opened her mouth to try and 
566 talk.
567   Her canines were at least an inch long from her gumline.
569   "help me......"
571   "Wh-what the hell is this?"  I coud feel a sense of teror building up in me. 
572 This was replaced by compassion when her eyes met mine.  
573   I began to lift her and take her to the couch.
574   "hunger...must...feed..."
575   I laid her down on the couch.
576   "Hunger," I was almost afraid to finish, "for what?"
577   "blood," she said as a tear rolled down her cheak, "your blood..." then she 
578 lost consciousness.
579   What the hell am going to do now?  
580  
581 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
582  
583   "It doesn't happen verry often," she said sitting up, "only every ten years
584 or so.  Not on a regular cycle.  Some times longer, some times shorter.  It's
585 the short cycles that run hell on me.  The long ones I can fight..."
586   Good God, she's a vampire, a vampire.
587   "...But the five ...year one's...that kill..." I could see the pain in her
588 eyes as sweat beeded on her brow.
589   My terror and my compassion were having an all out war over what to do. The 
590 terror was losing.
591   "I'm sorry," she said looking down, "I'm manipulating you...like lastnight...
592 I need a...victim...I'm doing my best...to controll my..." she went limp but 
593 remained conscious.
594   
595   Terror lost.

609 I tend to keep a fairly tight rein here on language used. This is for
610 two reasons, one is that this board is much more open than many, and
611 is often one of the first boards that a new modem person calls because
612 many of the computer stores give out this number when asked. I don't
613 want to turn off a new user with foul langauge that might offend them.
614 Second, I used to be a bit more lax in the past, and the system 
615 degraded rapidly into very poor quality messages and users. So rather
616 than allowing it to drop to that level I've found it best to simply
617 inhibit the usag I've usually found that 99% of the time the langauge
618 does not need to be used. Too often it gets used simply to prove that
619 the person can say it. Not much of a reason if you ask me. One other
620 thing you will find if you ever desire to publish your writting is
621 that 99.99999% of the time the editor will ask you to remove such
622 writting if he doesn't reject it outright because of it. The mark of
623 a good writter is one that doesn't have to resort to the use of
624 obscene langauge to get their point across. Unless of course you
625 intend to write pornography.

640      Valescena is a quiet village in a remote section of the great lanathira
641 forrest.  Of course Lananara is a world of great forrests.  Lanaathira is only 
642 one of many.
643      One of the unique charms of Valescena is the custom that one of the rooms
644 at its inn be reserved for planetary coordinators.  By tradition it is one
645 particular room.  This is slightly qurios in that only a very few planitary
646 coordinators have ever heard of Valescena, let alone visited there.
647      While it is true that themnax once served in that capacity it was only
648 a rather brief eppisode in one of his many lives.
649      Be that as it may, many fond weeks, even months are from time to time 
650 spent there.
651      It was on one of his earlier visits that he discouvered this room's other
652 unique feature.
653      From the Valescena mode exchange, little more than a single covered 
654 platform, a bolder lined gravel path winds through sweet scented evergreens.  
655 An arched wooden footbridge crosses a cheerfully gurggling stream.  From the

657 of the inn.  Near the meadow's center stands a single rowan tree.
658      The inn, more particularly that special room, is a gateway accross 
659 alternat universes.  It is indeed a room at an Inn in many of them.
660      A small package in one of themnax's many pockets started making a familiar
661 sort of odd noise.  He reached in and caused it to still.
662      Getting up from the table where he had been shairing stories and sipping
663 lubintau elixer he excused himself and made his way to his room.

673    I sat at her bedside and waited for her to wake.  Would I still make my offe
674 when she could hear me?  Half of me just wanted to run, the other wouldn't for-
675 give me if I did.  Her rest wasn't peaceful, she keped tossing and turning and 
676 her breathing eas incredably heavy and fast.  I felt both helpless and useless 
677 as I sat there.  I could only wait...
678  
679 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
680  
681   "You don't have to do this," she said.
682   "I know," but when would she pass-out again and not wake up?  "But what good 
683 are friends if they won't crack a vein for you once and a while?"
684   She laughed at this for a moment.  When she stopped she reached over and 
685 placed her hand on mine.
686   "Are you sure you want to do this?" she aske, her eyes tearing into me and 
687 her voice reaching deep into my soul.  "I mean, you dont seem all that frighten
&88 ed."
689   "I minored in drama, remember?  Besides, I'll probably pass-out and not feel 
690 a thing."  I smilled, as did she, ant I saw her fangs agaiin and wanted to run.
691 I swollowed hard.  "Well," I said hesitantly, "Lets get it over with."
692   "Don't sound so callus," she said in tone of voice that made me feel I said 
693 exactly the wrong thing, "I mean, youre not like some cow or a chicken..."
694   "I'm sorry if I breached good ededicut<SP>, bot I'm not use to dealling with 
695 with this sort of thing..."
696   "I'm sorry..."
697   "You shuld be," Once more I smiled, I really didn't beleve what was going on,
698 so I wasn't taking this seriously, "Now, sall we?"
699   "Ok, first, take off your shirt and turn around."
700   I did.  I felt her hands on my shoulders.  She began to give me a massage.
701   "Aren't we a little tense." 
702   "Yes," I said dryly.  It felt so relaxing, I began to rotarte my neck.  "I 
703 guess this will take some getting use to."
704   "Don't worri, I don't plan on making this a habbit."
705   "Well sofar I'm enjoying it."
706   She stopped the massage and I could feel the bed shift beneath me as she
707 moved closer.  I could feel her warm breath comming closer and closer.  I felt 
708 the end of her fangs sink into me...

731   I woke up to the sound of the Moody Blues.  My neck felt a little stiff.  I 
732 tilted my head to the left and a loud *crunch* ensued.  To afraid to tilt it 
733 back, I went back to sleep.
734   When I again woke up, I could hear the Moodys coming from the other room.  If
735 I wasn't mistaken she was listening to On The Threshhold Of A Dream.  Sitting 
736 up way to fast made my stomach want to empty itself.  Fortunatly I also felt 
737 like I hadn't eaten for days.  I made my way to the bedroom door.
738   "Good evening," she smiled as I entered the room.  Thank God she no longer 
739 has those fangs.  "How do you feel?"
740   "Like Hell, yourself?"
741   "Just fine thank you," she motioned for me to sit in the chair opposite her, 
742 "Really, I mean it.  Thank yo" her eyes perced something within me and I smiled
743   "We'll get some food into you, that shuld help."
744   "Are you sure that's wise?  I feel terably hungover.  I usually barf alot whe
745 n I'm hungover."
746   "I'm sure that's true, gross, but true." she gave me a sick look, "But I'm 
747 pritty sure I know what I'm talking about," she looked down, "Unfortunatly."
748   "Hey it's ok, honest.  Don't be that way."
749   "Well, damn it, I feel like I've violated you.  I always do.  I always have."

798 Jody, try entering *40* periods. Then hit enter. Then hit ctrl-c to get the
799 command prompt. Then all you have to do is CH /./|-/
800 and viola! your border is there. Or you could enter 20 periods and use |-|-
801 in the CHange command...
802 For example:
803 .......................................
804 |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

829 I predict that within twelve years (by 2000, obviously), over eighty percent
830 of the world's computers will be accessible through one central network.
831 And no, not the phone network. Also, "true" parallel processing will not be
832 available until 2030. Stacking 80386 chips and calling it "parallel" as
833 Sequent (my company) does is not going to do it. We still need a system that
834 will handle a number of problems simultaneously, without running into all
835 of the logic errors that one usually encounters in these types of situations.
836 AI Multitasking with machines like the "Connection Machine" is as close as
837 we're probably going to get for a while, although that squat black box is
838 nothing more than a glorified set of adding machines operating in chain.

981 "Ticking away, the moments that make up a dull day.." Those were the words
982 sung in the song "Time" by Pink Floyd. But yesterday it was I who was living
983 that reality. Sitting in the Emergency room at the Portland Kaiser Hospital,
984 I waited and hour before a Nurse took my name and other important info. All the
985 while my thumb throbbed on. I had cut a slice into the inside part of my left
986 thumb that went pretty deep. It was hurting a lot and I really wanted something
987 to ease the pain, ya know? Anyway, I finally got admitted into the ER and 
988 waited on a bed for about an hour and a half for someone to remove the 
989 bandaging that had been placed on my thumb. Then another half hour for a docto
990 look at it. It took four hours for them to check out my thumb, clean it and
991 finally sew it up. I don't blame the staff there, I blame the oranization. They
992 were apparently understaffed or something, but they should have a plan to take
993 care of such emergencies. What if a natural disaster or man made one had 
994 happened? If they couldn't handle things like they were last night a disaster 
995 would literally be a living hell! Personally I believe somebody screwed up
996 really bad somewhere. Take life with a
997 grain of panic! L8r,
