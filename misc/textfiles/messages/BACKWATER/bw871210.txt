171   to test our accomplishment in this area. There are some questions

173   the ability  to perceive or learn other things? What is the 'Coin

283 If you want to see the previous 999 lines, just enter the command
284 "DB" at the prompt, and you will be looking at the previous disk.
285 If you want to see messages prior to that, you will need to contact
286 the archive group who maintain all data that has ever graced this
287 system. File format is MSDOS. A nominal fee is charged for a single
288 disk copy (which includes 4 to 6 BW "disks") or you can buy into the
289 group which currently distributes the archive disk at about $1.00
290 or so a archive disk (actaul costs vary depending on costs of
291 archive distribution). You can buy into the complete archive for
292 around $50-$100 or so (I don't know for sure what the exact cost is)
293 which includes ALL previous BWMS disks. You supply your own MSDOS
294 disks to put the files on. You will need about 89 dsdd 5 inch disks.

391    Hello there.
392  
393    I would like to invite the Backwater regulars over to my board to check out
394 a new feature I've just installed: B-Boards. What's a B-Board? Well, you're
395 already looking at one. I am not sure who started the term, but I think it was
396 on Tanis (anybody remember?). Anyway, I've set up 3 500 line B-Boards, quite
397 similar to Backwater. I'd like to see what you folks think, and maybe get some
398 users on them as well.
399  
400    Also, I have quite a collection of text files online available for download.
401 Stories, fact, fiction, humor, just about anything. And I'm always trying to
402 get more.
403    Anyway, give me a call, and dn't forget to mention where you saw this.

417 "Is Midgard (*sp correct*) a house or a bulletin board?  Yes.  We are a 
418 house in Southeast portland where delta tends to tend towards the maximum.
419 We also have a bulletin board in tacoma run by someone who doesn't live here,
420 but thinks that we're really neat.   But on to other things...
421  
422                                   The Model
423              A concise description of how the world should work
424                                 and often does
425  
426   1.  People do nice things for you whether or not you do nice things for
427       them.  This *should* make you want to nice things for them, regardless
428       of whether or not they were the doers.
429  
430   2.  What is needed *will be provided* by the universe.  NOTE: *Your*
431       idea of what it is and the Universe's will likely as not match.
432  
433   3.  Stupidity is not *necessarily* fatal!
434  
435   4.  The model says:  Why for? (Four?!?)(Fore!?!)(Fore...Play?:-))
436       Why not four?
437  
438   5.  Justice IS.
439  
440   6.  Security is a place where you want to be.
441  
442   7.  Destination is not important.  In fact, it's not even necessarily
443       existent.
444  
445   8.  I forget what 8 was 4.
446  
447   9.  The difference between an ostrich and a human:  The ostrich doesn't
448       know the difference.
449  
450  10.  Homicide is a bad idea even if Murder is a good idea.
451  
452  11.  If anything should be removed from the universe, you and i would be
453       the first to go.
454  
455  12.  The opinions of the management are not necessarily relevant.
456  
457  13.  The universe MAY NOT do anything about your emergency.
458  
459  14.  You can as easily be alive as dead -- the universe doesn't know the
460       difference, although people do.
461  
462  15.  Just because *I* think so doesn't mean !we! think so.
463  
464  16.  You can't beat up on our friends -- onle WE can.
465  
466  17.  Everything written here is incorrect, but none of it is very far wrong.
467  
468  18.  Ribbitt.
469  
470  19.  T.A.G.
471  
472  20.  You have influence over everything in the universe.  Extent varies.
473  
474  21.  You will be held accountable for your environment, regardless.
475  
476  22.
477  
478  23.  ***Do Something***!
479  
480  24.  Everything is bigger than you are!
481  
482  25.  You are most people, but most people aren't you.
483  
484  26.  There are more than 24 hours in any given day.
485  
486  27.  Strawberries.
487  
488  28.  Let's end this quickly, please.  (Tenkyu belly much)
489  
490  29.  The universe is contained in a plain (plane) brown wrapper.
491  
492  30.  Everyone looks good in a hat.  Some people refuse to concede this.
493  
494  31.  2 + 2 = 5.  Find the other 1.
495  
496  32.  Tenkyu, R.B.F., R.A.H., R.*.B.
497  
498  33.  Banana.
499  
500  34.  We don't like everybody.  And "we" do't necessarily love everybody.
501  
502  35.  Entropy does not require your support.
503  
504  36.  We didn't get here first.  Neither did Columbus.  Or Leif Erickssen. 
505       Or You.
506  
507  37.  Walking on water is easier if you know how to swim.
508  
509  38.  Learn today.  Tomorrow may be too late.
510  
511  39.  Some things in this model contradict. Note: We are modeling the universe!
512  40.  Twelve wasn't enough.
513  41.  The universe is an ostrich.
514  42.  Everyone misinterprets this list.  But then again, this is a model.
515 If you don't get it the first time, ask.If you still don't, you don't want to.

533      'Twas the week before christmas and all through the Inn not a user 
534 was stirring not even a MS Mouse. The twits were all chastened and tucked 
535 in their beds, while visions of modems danced in their heads. 
536      My computer was merrily humming and I was relaxed. I had just 
537 settled down to do some coding of which I had been lax, when over on the 
538 bbs there came such a clatter, I jumped from my no-back-chair to see what 
539 was the matter. I turned on the monitor and threw back the dust cover. 
540      The phospher began to glow, and the words to form, then what to my 
541 wondering eyes did appear, but a re-newed man named Voyeur with a 
542 slightly used liver. Quicker than auto-script did I see him type, ON log, 
543 then password, a line number then print.  A quick scan at DA, then on to 
544 DB to read what what there. 
545      It was almost as if I could hear the click of each key. He paused 
546 but a moment then went right to work, reading all that he had missed. 
547 He filled his screen with the words that abound making sure to capture 
548 each word that was there. 
549      But soon he was done and made ready to go. I whispered aloud before 
550 he typed BYE, Merry Christmas my friend, and to you a long life.

759                  Rating Your New Year's Eve Party
760                            by Dave Barry
761  
762      If you throw yourselves a New Year's Eve party, the worst thing that could
763 happen is that you throw a party where your friends call yo up the next day and
764 say they had a nice time, then you'll be expected to throw another party next
765 year.
766      What you should do is throw the kind of party where your friends wake up
767 several days later and call their lawyers to find out if they've been indicted
768 for anything. You want your guests to immediately start planning NYE parties of
769 their own a year in advance, just to prevent you from having another one.
770      So be sure your party reaches the correct Festivity Level:
771  
772      Festivity Level One: Your guests are chatting amiably with each other,
773 admiring your Christmas tree ornaments, singing carols around the upright 
774 piano, sipping at their drinks and nibbling on hors d'oeuvres.
775  
776      Festivity Level Two: Your guests are talking loudly- sometimes to each 
777 other and sometimes to nobody at all, rearranging your Christmas tree 
778 ornaments, singing "I Gotta Be Me" around the upright piano, gulping their
779 drinks and wolfing down hors d'oeuvres.
780  
781      Festivity Level Three: Your guests are arguing violently with inanimate
782 objects, singing "I Can't Get No Satisfaction", gulping other people's drinks
783 wolfing down Christmas tree ornaments, and placing hors d'oeuvres in the 
784 upright piano to see what happens when the little hammers strike.
785  
786      Festivity Level Four: Your guests, hors d'oeuvres smeared all over their
787 naked bodies are performing a ritual dance around the burning Christmas tree.
788 The piano is missing.
789  
790  
791      You want to keep your party somehwere around Level Three, unless you rent
792 your home and own Firearms, in which case you can go to Level Four. The best
793 way to acheive Level Three is with Eggnogg.
794  
795      Eggnog is a traditional holiday drink invented by the English. Many people
796 wonder where the word "eggnog" comes from. The first syllable comes from the
797 English word "egg", meaning "egg". I don't know where the "nog" comes from.
798  
799      To make Eggnog, you'll need Rum, Whiskey, Wine, Gin, Vodka, Everclear and
800 if they are in season, eggs. Combine all ingridiants in a large festive bowl
801 and induce your guests to drink this mixture.
802  
803      If your party is successful, the police will knock on your door, unless
804 your party is very successful, in which case they will lob tear gas through
805 the living room windows. As host, your job is to make sure that they don't
806 arrest anyone. Or, if they're dead set on arresting someone, it isn't you. 
807 The best way to handle this situation is to show a lot of respect for their
808 uniforms and assure them you're not doing anything illegal. Here's how to 
809 handle it:
810  
811      Police: Good evening. Are you the Host?
812         You: No.
813      Police: We've been getting complaints about this party.
814         You: About the drugs?
815      Police: No.
816         You: About the guns then? Is somebosy complaing about the guns?
817      Police: No, the noise.
818         You: Oh the noise. Well, that makes sense, because there are no guns
819              or drugs here. <An enormous explosion is heard> About the noise,
820              the neighbors?
821      Police: The neighbors fled inland hours ago. Most of the complaints have
822              come from Pittsburgh. Do you think you could ask the host to
823              quiet things down a bit?
824         You: No problem.
825  
826      At this point a Volkswagen bug with primitive religious symbols drawn on
827 the doors emerges. The police dive for cover as it races out the front door
828 onto the lawn, where it mashes into a tree. Eight guests tumble out onto the 
829 grass moaning. (See. Things are starting to wind down.)
830      If you survive the party, and you're looking for something to do that's
831 not too far from the bathroom, you should watch the New Year's Day Football 
832 Bowl game and parade on television. Bowl games offer a world of variety,
833 mainly marching bands, floats, bands of motorized vehicles that are covered 
834 with flowers and everything else you say last year while waiting for your
835 next trip to the bathroom.

851 To attempt to answer BlueHorizon's questions regarding the literal translation
852 of L'homme sans Parity would require reams of electronic media, and such a
853 requirement is too much to ask of backwater at the moment. A shortened version
854 of the answer, abridged to fit small 3x5 cards follows:
855  
856 Along time ago on backwater, a user by the name of dropped bit weaved through
857 the guardtones of telehackerdom and called Backwater I his home. Many
858 adventures did this _dROPPED bIT_ (the exact spelling of his name) partake in.
859 But as all things must end, so did the participation of this character on BW.
860 In his place, came a new user, a so-called InnHabitant who went by the non-de-
861 plume of L'homme sans Parity. From earth's France did he hail, hence the
862 Parisian tone to the name. L'homme stands for man, so the gender of this
863 character (unlike other names that give no indication) was never in question.
864 'sans' means without, simple enough. The tricky in this name is 'parity.'
865 The French language is considered a national treasure by francophiles, and is
866 guarded closely. Many English words, much to the chagrin of the French, have
867 crept into their language. 'weekend', 'blue jeans', and 'computer' are a few
868 examples of this crossover. English words have made their impact to the
869 greatest extent in technical areas. There are several English words with no
870 French equivalent because of the very nature of the language. In
871 technical circles, parity is considered a high-order function that is
872 difficult to solve with simple systems. In more popular terms, it is a modem
873 program setting that refers to EVEN, ODD, MARKING, SPACING, or NO parity.
874 For example, using a word size of 7 bits with marking parity will set the
875 parity bit to marking (8th bit set to one). But there is more to the story.
876 Parity has other meanings outside of the technical arena. Parity can be
877 interpreted as equality or parallelism. So what do we have now? "The Man
878 without Parity." Ambiguous at best, but perhaps that is the way he likes
879 it. Could it be a man without difficult-to-solve high order problems, or
880 without parity bits in his modem program, or without equal or equivalent
881 abilities. Maybe none of the above, maybe all three, or some combination
882 thereof. No one really knows for sure, and most don't really care. L'homme
883 sans Parity is, and as you see, literal interpretation is not really
884 essential.
