100 BOOT LICK BOOT LICK IE THE SOCIETY OF,
101  There are many long time lurkers around here, but not all of them see history
102 the same way. Those who have earned so much praise at the expense of others
103 are members of an elite group. Stories went by via news paper snippits and
104 inter-office memos. This was unique at first, but many soon got tired of UPI
105 newswire entries written with the succint smack of an over worked editor.
106 These same writers gave back handed comments to the authors of the more
107 traditional prose statements. "Your stuff is too long" they said. "Your
108 entries are too conventional" they said. I wonder if Thomas Hardy and Emily
109 Dickenson had to contend with such short sighted comments also? There is
110 room for all styles. Never should one style be excluded to the expense of
111 any other. Never should one style be praised to the expense of any other.
112 The comments on the last disk are the resurgence of this regretable attitude.
113 Did anyone notice that the other long time lurker used a margin very similar
114 to the writer so highly acclaimed in the entry? Beyond coincidence, this is
115 purely a case of patting one's self one one's back. Questionable conduct on
116 a system where catharsis is looked down on. Perhaps if we could all learn
117 to be temperant of other's styles, and stick with writing instead of
118 belittling what we don't agree with, the atmosphere here would clear and
119 new writers would not feel so bullied.

122 He walked into THE INN, looked around for a friendly face... and didn't see
123 one.  He took a chair that was most close to the fireplace, pulled it back,
124 and draped his heavy fur coat over the back of it.  "Inn-keep, housewine,
125 please.  Oh, and a meal, too, if you please."  His voice was clear: It
126 commanded attention.  He sat down.
127    He was a traveller, cleaner then most... no lice.  Dust covered his knee-
128 high black boots, whose worn heels indicated that he had been walking for
129 sometime.  He wore brown trousers, of a durrible make, a forest green shirt
130 with long loose sleeves, and a brown vest.  His long smooth features were
131 broken only by a small, but noticable scar on his right cheek.
132    He looked up as the inn-keeper drew closer.  The inn-keeper carried a
133 glass of reddish thick liquid in one hand, and a plate of steaming stew in
134 the other.  The fare was laid before the stranger and a hand was held out
135 to recieve the coins that the stranger was already reaching for.
136    "That should do it," the stranger said.  "The names Lelund Falstarr, and
137 if you've got the time and the inclanation later, I have a story to tell.
138   I'll also be needing a room for a while... if it is possible, that is."

144 "There...finished.  I can hardly believe that five days of work was necessary
145 to repair two minutes of arcing.  Good thing the supply rooms are well stocked.
146 I'll have to refill them, later."
147 As if on cue from the Doctor's words, the very familiar "swish-thunk" became
148 audible in the control room.  A large crate materialized near the console.
149 "And what have we here?  A present, and it's nowhere near Christmas time.
150 Or is it?  No, time gauge says not.  Were you expecting a package, Milch?"
151 "No, of course not."
152 "Perhaps I can explain, Master."  A familiar cybernetic voice waifed over the
153 crate.  A second later, K-9 rolled into view.
154 "K-9!  And where have you been, my errant android?  By the looks of the crate,
155 I'd say you've taken a vacation on Gallifrey."
156 "I have been on Gallifrey, Master.  The Council sent you a Rudder."
157 "So THAT's where that 'black box' came from!  I'd wondered about that.  Seems
158 every time they get into trouble they send me off to do their dirty work.
159 How did they know about my friends?  And what's in the crate?"
160 "I have been told that the Council became aware of a massive disturbance in
161 the Vortex, near several major travel routes.  It was decided that you were
162 the best choice for the job.  The crate contains spare parts for any damage
163 the TARDIS may have sustained, plus a newly-developed transport circuit to be
164 attached to the console circuits."
165 "Well, Milch, don't just stand there.  Help me put these parts away, and
166 we'll celebrate our good fortune together.  Er, K-9, a new circuit, did you
167 say?  Does it have a particular designation?"
168 "Affirmative, Master.  It is called a Skip circuit.  Full function is unknown.
169 A transmat device equipped with such a circuit was necessary to send me here."
170 "Possibly the scientists on Gallifrey have finally discovered planal travel,
171 Doctor.  It would be wise to inform them that other universes have their own
172 equivalents to Timelords, and that travel between should be avoided if at all
173 possible.  Such travel, though, could provide an escape route if a particularly
174 dangerous situation should develop..."
175 The Doctor considered.  "Install it, K-9.  Milch, in the meantime, we have to
176 rely on your archaic mumbo-jumbo.  I'm itchin' to rest my feet awhile, so to
177 speak.  Shall we stop at the Inn?"
178 I smiled.  "My pleasure, Doctor."

184 And to that dope with the devilish comments, you may think it's funny now, and
185 get a kick out of being so "daring..." but you won't be so happy when you find
186 out the truth... we'll all find out sooner or later, but only those who bothered
187 to really listen to what this world means will be happy with the result.
188 This world is yours now perhaps, but it will soon fall apart. And when it does,
189 remember that it will not come close to comparing what awaits you in the next
190 world. If you know the dark side, you must know there has to be a light side.
191 And that darkness is VERY dark, and evil won't seem so fun when there is no one
192 to comfort you. And if you're just joking around, take a second and think that
193 perhaps it's not a joke, and you've just invited him into your life.
194 Now imagine the dirtiest, wickedest, scumiest person you can imagine, and go
195 up and hug him. Because that's just what you've done. It's not too late to turn
196 back... think about it.

203       A TYPICAL (ESPECIALLY MON.) morning.......
204 
205   Ok this is how it usually goes... I'm lying in bed asleep when I'm rudely awak
206 end by the headache-giving rock music coming fron me clock radio. As I become 
207 consious, I'm thinking, "God, make this be a dream," as the radio plays, "It's  
208 just how ya feel, when ya know it's for real." When I have almost become comscio
209 us I reach over to turn the damn thing off. "Dont flip that switch, we got more
210 ar as I fumble for the switch.
211    After I finally manage to get out form under the soothing covers, I tromp
212 down to take a nice hot shower to wake me up. Afer about5 minutes of not getting
213 any closer to being awake, I realize that the relaxing hot water wont help me.
214 I decide to turnthe cold on mrore. Just
215 
216 a little. Unfortunetly, at this hour of the morning, (about 7:30) I have no sens
217 e of "a little bit." AARRGHH!!! Every day the same thing.. At that pioint I 
218 become fully awake as I freeze my buns
219 off. Then I turn it back too far and
220 go from freezing cold to searing hot. Giving up, I walk upstairs to get dressed
221 as I mutter about the knob being too precise.
222    After all that, I run through the freezing rain to the bus. And some people
223 wonder why I'm grumpy when I arrive
224 at school!

247    When James opened his eyes, it was still dark. His jaw ached miserably. His eyes finally focused on Tariya, sitting
248 on a rock beside him, holding a large stick in her hands. "You're not going to hit me with that?" He groaned.
249    "I might"
250    "Well, please don't. Hurts enough as it is." He rolled into a sitting position and blinked at the pretty patterns
251 forming in his eyeballs.
252    "You deserve it! Of all the cold-"
253    "Oh, c'mon. It's a helluva lot better than you might have gotten if something real nasty took a liking to you.
254 There's THINGS out there that would make those four drunks look like marshmellows in comparison!" Tariya still looked
255 stubborn. "Hell, I'M the one who's in pain! Did they hurt you? Did they get a chance? Is you're precious virginity
256 still intact?"
257    James had an inborn talent for hittng sore spots. Tariya hollered, "More intact than your skull's going to be!" and
258 brought the stick down on him.
259    Before it could connect, his hand shot up and grasped it like iron. The sturdy wood splintered to toothpicks in his
260 grip. "I'm not going to hit you, but that doesn't mean I'll let you make hamburger out of me."
261    She dropped the stick and put her face in her hands. Long moments later she looked at him again. "How did you know
262 I was a virgin?"
263    "You mean you ARE?" he asked in honest surprise. He ducked her boot as she kicked at him. "Calm down! It's just
264 that I thought I was the only one around." She didn't try to kick him again so he must have said the right thing. She
265 just sat there, looking betrayed and hurt. "Okay, this is what happened. I didn't want to take those guys in the
266 building because there were too many innocent bystanders. The last time I got into a fight with people like that I
267 literally tore the place apart. Honest to God, I was gonna follow you out but the damndest thing happened. Some geek
268 wearing boxer shorts and a cape and nothing else ran in through the door with a double barreled shotgun. He started
269 screaming at some rabbit that was sitting on a table near me and next thing I know he lets the poor bunny have it with
270 both barrels. Somehow he missed but he was gonna keep trying until he succeded even if he had to make swiss cheese out
271 of the whole place and everybody in it. I had to blow him away. Hell, you must have heard it. The whole TOWN must have
272 heard it."
273    "Yes..." she admitted, "I did hear it."
274    "After that I took right off after you. By the way, did you know there was a steamroller blocking the doorway?" She
275 replied dryly that she had noticed it on the way out. She'd latched on to it and the drunks had had to pry her loose.
276 "I honestly didn't mean for it to happen that way but it did. You didn't get hurt, though." He rubbed his jaw
277 again.
278    "No. But I'm still mad."
279    "Well, I'll have to be satisfied with that." He looked over at the inn. Warm light poured out through its windows.
280 Somebody was struggling to get in past the steamroller blocking the door. James wrinkled his brow in concentration and
281 Tariya suddenly felt great forces stirring. A cloud of dust blew from under the 'roller as it levitated several inches.
282 It slowly floated until it was well clear of the door, then landed with a heavy thud. James put a hand to his temple.
283 Now his whole head hurt. He sighed, "Well, I can't go back there. I think they're a little peeved about the mess I
284 left. 'sides," he said ruefully, "I wasn't too popular anyway since I let those drunks walk out with you without a
285 fight. So I'm gonna split. Are you coming with me or not?"
286    Tariya thought it over for quite a while. James didn't prod her further. Finally she said, "Okay. I guess so. But
287 you had better not do that again!"
288    "No promises." He said as he got up and brushed himself off. "You drag me down too much and I'll leave you at the
289 nearest available civilization."
290    "Fair enough." She replied grimly. Together they walked off into the darkness.

335     It was getting late, the Innkeeper was just finishing his nightly clean up
336 of THE INN.  A few of the reagulars cliqued together on the other side of 
337 the fireplace from the stranger.  The strangers breath came even and slow...
338 to the untrained observer, he might appear asleep.  He most certainly was
339 not.  "You feel like tell'n that story now Mister..Ah I seem to have misplaced
340 the name."
341     "Falstarr, Lelund Falstarr.  And yours?"
342     "JoeJoe will be fine," said the Innkeeper.  The Innkeeper felt a little
343 nervous, no... more unneasettled really.  He couldn't place why.
344     "It's a long story, one for more than just one fire," he chuckled to 
345 himself, pointing at the fireplace as he spoke, "But I would be more than 
346 willing to start her tonight."  He pushed his chair back, until he could
347 lean it back to rest aginst the wall.  He raised his voice slightly, "It's
348 cold outside, and the fire is still high... I've a story to tell if you've
349 a mind to listen."  Those that chose to moved in a bit, others just turned 
350 their ear a bit, feigning disintrest.  He waited for the room to settle, then
351 when the room was quiet, he began.
352     "I am a WANDERER," the way he spoke the word, you could tell that it held
353 more than just the usual meaning.  "I seek, THE STONE.  I have travelled 
354 across four realities and countless worlds... taking longer to do so then
355 some of you can concieve, concerning the measuring of time.  I have been close
356 three times, but never closer then I am right now.  It is on this world, a

371      Whew!  I could still smell the smoke from the shotgun as it settled.
372 Turning and yawning,  I realized that I was in need of a good nap, before I
373 fell asleep against my will.  
374      Another yawn, and as I just began to close my eyes, they met with the
375 green-yellow stare of a blackish cat on thee hearth of the fireplace.  Our
376 eyes met, and a silent conversation took place between us.  
377      Smiling, I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep.

432   Scarlet lion -- well, not TOO clean, OK?  After all we do want to remain
433 welcome at this inn.
434   To all:  I've noticed that things are very cyclic around here.  Right now
435 we're in a down cycle -- not too much happening, the disks stay around for
436 several days.  It's a great time for anyone that has been thinking of trying
437 their hand at storytelling for the first or second time.  Don't worry about
438 criticisms -- you're going to get it, from the learned disputing your use
439 of grammar to the unwashed "NYA NYA YOU'RE BORING!" of the mentally less than
440 fully competent.  Or -- far more likely, you won't hear a thing.  You should
441 really take this as praise, for far more will react to something they find
442 unpleasant than pleasant.  If you hear nothing, persevere!  You may not be
443 doing spectacularly well, but you're not doing badly!  Remember, if you want
444 to run in a marathon, you still have to take the first faltering steps.

464 To Hartleeb: Don't ever assume ignorance on anyones part... have YOU ever SEEn
465 what happens when a finger is stuck in a gun? Or is it just HEARSAY? 
466 Also... Believe me... I know what Philistines means: why belittle what you do
467 not know for fact? Maybe DESTROYER'S story wasn't worthy of high praise, but
468 the term philistine was used to reinforce the idea that those who critisized
469 perhaps could not see the true art that was taking place. Since you seem to
470 jump the gun so quickly on these matters and judge what others consider to be
471 art (in the eye of the beholder, don't forget), perhaps YOU should look up the
472 
473 definition again. Then come back and tell me whether I know the meaning or not.
474 Disagreeing with what you've been called is one thing, but when you claim that
475 the deliverer doesn't know what it means, then perhaps that's the best example
476 yet of the fact that you indeed are what you were accused of being.
477 I, er, assume you were one of those who pulled that infamous Destroyer-upsetting
478 trigger????
479 
480 Destroyer: perhaps you hadn't wrapped it up, but by answering your critics in
481 such a creative manner, you created an emotional peak which may be hard to build
482 on...

573 	Hello, I am new to this (or any) bulletin board.  I have a (surprisingly) Hayes
574 300, and got it just tonight (10-9-85).  I would like any and all information
575 on the use, disuse, and functions of said item.
576 	I am also a writer.  When I logged on, (my 2nd log-on) low and behold, other
577 stuggling writers, one finishing with Doctor Who, and the other a fantasist.
578 Well.
579 	I would like to add my meager scribblings to the pot-if only I knew it was
580 appreciated.  You see-critics and would-be critics-writers are like religions,
581 (only in a few ways, thankfully) without faith, they are nothing.
582 	Please, anyone, let me know what you think.  I also want soomeone to test 
583 a BBS I have written, mind you, just as a test to see if it works, so keep 
584 that in mind as well.  Time to clear the lines, a reply is appriciated.

604 To: J.J.Winn
605 You see, Mr. Winn, most folks don't have time for newcomers. After all, once you
606 have become experienced in something, all those inexperiences are to be frowned
607 upon. It is one of the few times many people, sad to say, are allowed the 
608 luxery of feeling superior, since they usually feel inferior in this maddening
609 world. Anyway, as a fellow new user (way back when), start poking around other B
610 BBS's and you'll find lists of BBS's stored in their memory. You'll end up with
611 so many numbers you won't know what to do with them all. But you might start 
612 with The Bit Bucket (254-xxxx); leave your name and number and when they verify
613 you can poke around all you want. It won't be long 'till you have more modem
614 buddies than you want! As for this one, it's a free forum populated by mostly
615 intelligent beings... you can write what you want but be warned that some of
616 them have spiked tongues....
