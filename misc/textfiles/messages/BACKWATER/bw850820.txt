24 Frustration in the name of love? Hardly a thought for the suumer-
25 time, but what of this finest of seasons, when the skies never
26 darken, but spirits are another story. We live our lives moment by
27 moment, yet when frustration is a constant companion, each moment
28 seems like an eternity that must be endured instead of enjoyed. I
29 tire of this muddle of a life I lead, where true happiness, what-
30 ever that elusive creature is, fails to fall into my grasp, no
31 matter how hard I try or how much I wish for it. Perhaps I am
32 trying too hard, wishing too much, but I know not what else to do.
33 To stop wishing and trying would be to admit defeat, and I am not
34 ready to do that yet. I am confused and bewildered. I am damned if
35 I do and damned if I don't. I can not go on like this. I am sick
36 as Hell and I'm not going to take it anymore. Please?

44    Thank you, Oh God, for Jesus Christ our pro, who shows us how to get
45 the right grip on life, to slow down in our back swing, to correct our
46 crazy hooks and slices, to keep our head down in humility and to follow
47 through in self-control.
48    May He teach us also to be good sports who will accept the rub of the
49 green, the penalty for being out-of-bounds, the reality of lost balls, the
50 relevancy of par, the dangers of the 19th hole and the authority of our
51 special rule book, the Bible.
52    And Lord, when the last putt has dropped into the cup; the light of
53 our last day has faded into the darkness of death; though our trophies be
54 few, our handicap still too low and that hole-in-one still only a dream;
55 may we be able to turn in to You, our tournament director, at the great
56 clubhouse, an honest scorecard.
57    Through Jesus Christ we pray, Amen.

92 anyway they had a unit called a 'parsec'... more like an AU... and

101 And sickness is indeed the problem. We become disheartened and des-
102 pondant over little things that mean nothing to those who care not
103 what we feel. We live under a cloud of unmeet desire and need. We 
104 reach out yet there is only substancless shadow that meets our grasp.
105 We turn and cry in the night for lost dreams. Yet the hope springs
106 eternal, we wish and pray and hope that an answer will be found, that
107 the prayers will be answered. Always we keep trying, reaching. And still
108 the confusion and frustration flows in our minds sapping our strength,
109 leaving the world a gray wash devoid of color. Until the need is
110 met, until the delema is solved there is no answer. So we keep on
111 trying, hoping for brighter days, waiting for the spring of love.

122       Glancing through a window of the Inn I take notice of a figure or two
123 far down the way that had been left behind many an hour ago.  (This entry
124 is a little messed up.)  Knowing what they must feel, missing the trip of a
125 lifetime, I chose for once to leave the warmth of this shelter to offer a
126 few words of friendship in their new solitude.
127       I had stumbled only a step or two past the old, weathered door when I
128 saw that one of the beings was hopping slowly away while making harsh
129 breathing sounds.  Or were they sobs?
130       Walking down the dusty path that lead away from the Inn, towards the
131 enbankment where sat one being, now alone.  Not really stirred or extremely
132 dismayed by the departure, she maintained her spirits by taking a twig that
133 lay along the wayside and began to create images in the sand that conveyed
134 a sense of meaning.  They were simple drawings, but they gave the feeling 
135 that behind them lay deeper spories yet untold.
136       As one such drawing came to its finishing touches she gave it a 
137 critical eye, adding a stroke or scratch to give it more character and then
138 wiped the ground smooth, ready for another image to spring to life from the
139 end of the twig that moved in the clutches of her hand.

147 I've just walked through a town that has suffered many hardships.  With
148 the landing of the shells has come the landing of the rooftops.  Hours
149 on end do the common people work to repair that which has crumbled
150 around them in their innocence.  Rest, for some, shall not come until
151 hours of work with chisel in hand has provided them with a few score 
152 more of bricks from the frames of their broken homesteads -- removing 
153 the old mortar so that the bricks might once again be used to give 
154 shelter and protection from the night.
155 This labor of the bourgeoisie is so much more remarkable now that I am
156 no longer amoung them in the simple way.
157 Today I've even seen a flower that has in some small way lived through
158 the struggle of cold.  Its beauty once again reminds me of you.  If only
159 you could be here with me, the waters of Dnepr are murky with your
160 absence.  In the morning we will leave Roslavl behind, there I will have
161 mailed this letter.  I miss you.

166      Even though I said I was finished, I wasn't.  I knew it would take at least ten minutes for her,
167 or them, to get to here and that would allow just enough time to finish with the last of the 
168 repetitious duties required during the daily grind.
169      All by myself at the end of my working day, my "office" has transformed from a room of organized

203      I looked into her eyes, our fingers touched for a moment, then she was
204 gone.  I was hooked.  The sign of a true romantic, eh?
205 
206      Hmmmm... I'm just learning to appreciate the phrase 'between the devil
207 and the deep blue sea'.  I'm stuck in the middle and don't know whether to
208 quit or ride this thing out.  But then it isn't entirely my decision... a
209 single word from her and we're done.
210 
211      I am lured by the Siren's song of desire... beneath the veil lie all
212 my fears and pain.
213 
214      Everytime we enter a new situation... we are guided by our memories 
215 and experiences... our fears, dreams, sucesses, and failures.  Usually the
216 result is the same.  God, how I want to change.  Can love make a difference?
217 
218      The paths of opportunity unfold about me, and yet I struggle to climb
219 the steepest, travel the most dangerous, and not just for myself.  Why?
220 Perhaps at the end I catch a glimmer of a new life... and I cannot walk
221 that path alone.

238         Rushed in the crowd, shoulder to shoulder, there is no one out
239 here for me.  I keep walking in the hope that someone I know will by
240 chance eventually bump into me, or I into them.  I can always hope.
241         The naked city with its thousands of stories just waiting to be
242 told, just waiting to be heard, just waiting...  I walk down the avenues
243 aimlessly, destiny is what I rely on to pull my feet to their goal.
244         Multitudes of singles and couples cross my path and the sound of
245 this angry global village fills my ears till all I hear is the rushing 
246 of the wind.  Being alone fills my senses, my mind runs in tiny circles,
247 and my heart does not find the rest it needs for it pounds only to keep
248 me alive... half its function goes unfulfilled.
249         Then it happened.  My path is crossed by another and the 
250 colliding of bodies drops us both to the pavement in a scurry to regain
251 our dropped possessions, the breeze flutters the half filled sacks.  In
252 an attempt to cover for my clodish action I offer the helping hand of a
253 good samaritan so that we may put our embarassments behind us as we will
254 soon both be on our ways to forget our stupidities and to remember our
255 petty deadlines.  The sound of the village is gone.
256         With an outstreched hand I return the dropped package to her 
257 grasp, her hand mine.  Shyly I look down at the parcle, then up into her
258 face.  It is the face of an angel.  Our hands grip tightly, our eyes 
259 lock, and our souls begin to intertwine.  This has never happened
260 before... ever.
261         The crowd continues to rush on, and we are equally oblivious of 
262 them.  That which has fallen to the ground from our hands is soon
263 forgotten as we are no longer in the material realm.  All that has been
264 left behind us, our seperate lives are no longer a reality.  We are now
265 one and my heart beats with the full commitment of maintaing our single
266 life force.
267         No one exists any longer for in my universe there is but one, 
268 and we are happy in our isolation, happy to be the sum of all existance.
269 The creation of the future is of no importance as we only consider that
270 which is of the moment, that which is now.
271         Rushed in the crowd, shoulder to shoulder, there is no one out
272 here for me.  I thought there was once, but now I can't even recall
273 the face.  My daydreams irritate me all the more.
274 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  One on One  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

279   The human brain processes sensations.  Deprived of its input, it manufactures
280 its own.  The sensorium of the human, when constantly bombarded with sensation,
281 achieves a rough balance with its environment by desensitizing itself.  As
282 the sensory input decreases, the organism attempts to maintain a sensory
283 balance by increasing the sensitivity of the sensory organs.  
284   To the piper, time had long since ceased to have meaning.  The first bolt
285 of fear that had filled him with the realization that he could see nothing,
286 the anaesthesia that deadened his sense of touch, the leaden quiet that 
287 kept him from even hearing the throb of his own heart, all seemed like only
288 preludes as he became disconnected from the more subtle senses that we all
289 own but do not name.  The tiny sensory feedback loops that tell us the position
290 of our limbs, the vague "digestive sensations", the reports of skeletal 
291 pressure, muscle tone, the operating feedback loops of the marvelously complex
292 machine that serves as a vehicle for our conciousness, all dwindled into the
293 soft greyness that filled space around the piper, interpenetrating his
294 entire being.

319    Hope springs eternal, even in summer, fall, and winter. Yet not
320 even hope can reach down into the depths of the soul and rescue a
321 floundering person from the vast shoreless ocean of depression. If
322 a drowning man in the sea has no hope but the sharks and the jelly
323 fish, what possible hope can the drowning man awash in this vast
324 ocean have? Man is afraid of the water just as he is afraid of 
325 depression. It is a feeling of remoteness and helplessness that
326 causes the initial panic. The panic is soon followed by a defense
327 mechanism that quickly gives way to utter hopelessness. And there
328 we stand, the circle now being complete, back to hope, and the
329 lack there of. Hope gone, love gone, life gone. There is no other
330 end or means.

334 .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
335     Emu had an interesting idea.  Actually, the more he thought about it,
336 the worse it sounded - but it might just work.  The basic risk was that it
337 could easily kill them all.
338     "Okay everyone," Emu anounced to the gathered adventurers, "we've got
339 a problem.  We've lost one of our friends, and we have to get him back.
340 However, Piper *is* in a position to feed us information on this ZEB
341 creature.  If Cragmore can maintain communications with Piper and get the
342 information from him, we might learn how to defeat the creature."
343     "I propose a plan " Emu continued "one that we must all agree upon
344 before we can implement it.  First, as long as Piper can hold up, with
345 Cragmore's help, we gather as much info as possible.  Second:  Trainor,
346 I've noticed that you do have capabilities for extending the Pell-Mell'
347 gravity field to the exterior of the ship.  Do you think that we could
348 tighten the field, and aim it at an object, creating a tractor beam of
349 sorts?"
350     "Well, I suppose..."
351     "Good.  Tin, since you seem to know what you're doing with grav
352 systems, would you and Fencer assist Trainor on the needed conversions.
353 Now, Bard, how accurate is our guidance and physical jump control?  In a
354 five parsec jump, can we hit a one hundred yrd radius target?"
355     "At that distance?  That's getting awfully tight."
356     "But can we do it?"
357     "With practice, and a helluva lot of luck, maybe."
358     "Okay, this is what I'm thinking."  Emu took a deep breath, than
359 continued: "When Piper can't hold out any longer, we'll plot for a position
360 within the ZEB creature and within tractor beam range of Piper.  We grab
361 Piper with the beam, and jump back out as quickly and as far as we can,
362 without loosing Piper.  That's the easy part, providing that our friend
363 ZEBie doesn't decide to blast us to kingdom come.  The trick will be to get
364 Piper out of raw space and into the ship.  I'm hoping that with the tractor,
365 we'll be able to pull him to the airlock."
366     Tin Man cut in.  "You know, Emu, we might be able to set up an air bubble
367 in the gravity beam to wrap Piper in."
368     "Good idea, Tin Man."  Emu responded.  "Now, the big question:  does
369 everyone think that this is worth trying?  Trainor?  It's your ship, and
370 you know more about ZEBie than the rest of us.  What do you think?"

373 Drowning, we can gasp and choke. Our lungs filled with dark water. The 
374 ocean is hopelessness which streaches endlessly around us. It consumes us.
375 The light falls short of eternity's edge. The water is dark at its depths
376 and man lies in its thickest darkness. Man is not like the fish who flounders
377 on land. When he allows himself, he will float to the ocean's surface. He
378 can not remain in the deathstate too long. Slow, quick, he will come to the 
379 airy world like a babe emerging from the womb. He must let go of dispair,
380 clinging to the darkness, and allow the light to shine.

390 We interrupt these stories for an important technical message...
391 Mikey: On the CPM disks... What does VA.COM do? Does READCPM allow the IBM to read Kaypro? Does it need to be RUNned
392 or is it MSDOS? What part of the CPeMulator does REENTER play? What does SAVE.COM do? When running the INSTALL.CPM for
393 the MTBASIC, I get an ERROR 20 <- invalid operation code. I get the same except with a 28 when running MTBASIC.CPM,
394 and a 08 when running COPY.CPM. PIP.CPM runs ok, is it the same PIP we all know and love? SPACE.CPM says BDOS Begins
395 at EC00 when run, is this correct? WRDCLEAN works - for WS right? COMPRESS works, GENLYNC works, and AMDINST works.
396 The .HEX file for AMODEM is about 58k long. In order to convert this from Intel hex format to loadable format I need
397 to run it through DDT right? I do not have LOAD or MLOAD, so it must be DDT. I will let you know how it works on the
398 LNW. Thanks for your help.
399 We know return to your regular programming...

402 Max: 100% ML?  Not P-Code, or ML created by a subset compiler?  Interesting.
403 L'homme: Will do, if need arises.  I'm just wondering how I'm going to get to

407 "All magical spells are balanced in power.  Energy that is channeled from
408 other planes of existance must be replaced, usually by the destruction of
409 matter in this plane.  Normally, the matter that is destroyed is the air
410 exhaled during the spellcasting itself.  Other objects, however, may be more
411 desirable.  Not all matter supplies return energy in equal amounts.  [See Also
412 Spellcasting, Diverting Magical Energy, Argentium, and Material Components]"

415 "No ideas come to mind immediately.  Tell you what, I'll sleep on it", the
416 Doctor said.  He stared at the large black oval hovering above the basement
417 floor, and tugged at his ear, nervously.
418 Grann approached it, cautiously.  "Is it aware?"
419 "No, Grann.  Not in itself.  Intelligent creatures may be monitoring it,
420 though.  Some may be travelling along it now.  Assuming we want to find the
421 cause of the Convolution, and I can't imagine why else we would be here, we'll
422 have to follow it to either end."
423 "I can rig up something to track it Spacetime wise, but you'll have to deal
424 with the rest of it, Milch.  Wait,
425 can you modify the program in the TARDIS computer?"
426 "No.  There was a measurable force pulling us to the destination.  This time,
427 there isn't."
428 "How do we know that?  The Black Box on the control panel might have switched
429 destinations."
430 "Then why show us this in the first place?  Why not just go directly in?"
431 We decided there was nothing for it but to return to the TARDIS and find out.
432 The Doctor braced himself for another spell, and the trip back was less 
433 eventful than the trip out.
434 We entered the control room, scanned it quickly.  The box had vanished.
435 "So much for that idea," the Doctor mused.  "We still don't know who/what sent
436 it.  Or why."
437 "One way to find out, Doctor.  Do whatever you can, Grann and I must find some
438 heavy-duty components for the spells I feel we'll need.  Now Grann, Argentium
439 is a rare mineral, but can be found in quantity in particular deposits-"

446 L'Homme: So many questions! Where do I start...
447 VA.COM rename it to VA.CPM. then, use RUN VA FILENAME.TXT. Once loaded, hit
448 the escape key, it will show you the menu. Yes, READCPM allows the IBM to 
449 read kaypro disks. To run, put Kaypro disk in B, then type READCPM B:.
450 SAVE.COM emulates the CP/M "save" command. Allowing you to save data to disk
451 from the CP/M transient memory (SAVE 150 FILENAME). MTBASIC is a Kaypro Z80
452 program, it will not run under the emulator. Same with COPY.CPM. PIP.CPM is
453 the PIP.COM that we all know and hate. What SPACE.CPM says is correct, it 
454 shows the highest point of free memory within the CP/M transient memory.
455 WRDCLEAN is for WS files. You can use LOAD or MLOAD on the .HEX file, or use
456 DDT followed by the SAVE to save the image to disk, or just use DEBUG (normal
457 IBM prg) to load the HEX file and save it again. (DEBUG AMODEM.HEX< 
458 NAMODEM.COM<  W<  Q< and you're done.)
459 Also, do you have access to any users group addresses? Thinking of sending
460 free copy of adventures as a promo. Yet another way to spread it around. 
461 Looking at both IBM and Tandy groups. Try to get the disks into their libraries.
462 It would be worth the advertising to get the disks to them.

468   Deprived of external sensations, the piper's brain began to provide its own
469 inputs.  Pitched to an extraordinary degree of sensitivity, the accidental
470 firing of a neuron became a major event for the brain.  That tiny activity was
471 taken, expounded on like an item of gossip in a small town, passed from cell
472 to cell, across synapses aching with activity, and transformed into events

482 STOP THE PRESSES (and the disk duplicators) - Mikey, the sysop of Fido105
483 informed me that the ability to skip the AdventureWare message by pressing
484 the spacebar was a bad idea. He suggested that I clear the kb buffer out,
485 which is difficult to do when the destination machine is unknown. The pokes
486 on a real IBM are different than those on a Tandy or a Sanyo. You saw what
487 pokes can do to a 99 44/100ths compatible like the Zenith 150. Therefore, I
488 am going to put another pause loop in the program before it asks for the
489 <spacebar>. What does all this mean? New versions! Was that a sigh I heard?
490 Well, no rest for the wicked... I will be recompiling tonight, and I will get
491 a disk out to you ASAP. As for the user groups, I will take a disk out to
492 the IBM club, and Tom Almy has given me information on the new Tandy 1000/
493 1200/2000? group in town. I will find out more, and possibly get the programs
494 to them too. Fido sysop will be uploading the programs to some east coast
495 biggies at 2400 baud as soon as I get the new versions to hip (upload)...
496 Maybe someday I can sit back and never have to worry about programming these
497 things again.....			nah....
498 Thanks for the CPM info. I wasn't aware I could use debug on CPM programs.

509    "In my life, I have seen a procession of people. Which procession are you
510 asking about?"  Quizzed the Sage, alert with a new question to answer.
511    "This procession does not have a name, although their vessel does,"
512    "What is the name of the device, and when were they headed?"  He quizzed
513 once again.  This time less interested, and less alert.
514    "Their device is or was, will be, oh fooey.  It is the 'Pell-Mell' and
515 it was headed off to meet an awfull bit of antimatter goo or something."
516     The sage sat for a moment and stared at his visitor rudely.  He said,
517 you want me to believe a gang of paratemporals got in the something that
518 was described as the 'Pell-Mell' and took off after a blob of antimatter
519 goo or something.  And if I believe this, we are going to see if they were
520 mentioned in a history book somewhere?  Anywhere?  Sideways in time, maybe?"

530     "woo thats rich" he said to no one in particular.  "That house brew must
531 truely be a nectar of the Ghod(s).  Potent it be for mortals such as we."
532     As the dizzyness in his head subsided it was replaced by a recurring melody
533 that could not be drivven off so easily!:

537     Elseware Charmichael was also struggling up from the depths of morphius.
538     The first thing he noticed was the clean, sweat smelling bed beneath his
539 back.  Try as he might, he could in no way remember getting there.  Likewise
540 therefor he had not the slightest notion of how he had gotten there.
541     The second thing he noticed was a subtle yet all-pervasive sense of vibra-
542 tion.  The dimly yet uniformly lighted room seamed almost alive with it from
543 every surface.  Somehow, making a wild guess to himself, I must be on a ship.
544     Impulsively overwhealmed by a compulsion to satisfy his newly aroused 
545 curiosity he roled up on one elbow and tried, too quickly, to sit up.  An 
546 impulse he instantly regreted.  The rush of blood away from his brain almost
547 put him back under.
548      Flopping back down he waited for his pulse to stabelize at a more managable
549 level.  It was then that he noticed the glowing word: 'call' on a single button
550 built into the night stand near his head, right next to what appeared to be
551 a speaker grill.
552      Cautiosly this time, and slowly, he brought his other arm over and touched
553 it with his thumb, then lay back, sighed and waited to see what would come next.
554      As he waited, a few dim memories begain swimming up, unbidden to concios-
555 ness.  The first of these was of being scaried shit-less at having been dis-
556 couvered in a tire carrier under a truck! 
557      Whait!  Could anything that bizarr be a real memory he wondered.  But then
558 he recognized the rough paiute face as belonging to an old friend who had been
559 his supervisor briefly during the year or so he had worked for the 'Suffering
560 Pathetic Railroad'
561      He rembered now.  Before eather of them could speak he heard a loud noise
562 and his erstwhile 'friend's' face seemed to crumple in on itself.
563      That was the last he remembered before he passed out.  Now he was here;

568     she was quiet. so quiet that she was able to stand beside me for several
569 minutes. watching me as i stood at the arcade game, busily eradicating
570 insectoid images on the screen. i might have noticed her if i had been less
571 excited by the game.
572     which is no matter. she was obviously endowed with intelligence and
573 prettiness. i was obviously interested in the qualities. we were as well
574 matched at most couples at our age.
575     i turned on my heel. after loosing the eternal struggle of insect versus
576 2163 a.d. fighter aircraft. i ran into her, having suprised her. the
577 collision forced a familiarity of sorts.
578     suprised as we were, giggling commenced. neither of us stopped, and by
579 the time we had, her friends had noticed us. of course, they began to
580 giggle. we stood giggling.
581     i decided against persuing a relationship on tried and true grounds. i
582 voiced these grounds. "oh sure, we might fall headlong into love. it might
583 even last for a few months, but then what? our musical tastes would clash.
584 soon our fashion and entertainment tastes would too. after a while, our
585 only foundation for a relationship would be a sense of stability. in years,
586 we might marry, have children, grow old together, die peacefully. all
587 because of our, collision!"
588     quite an outburst, even for myself. she seemed even more suprised, she
589 giggled. i seemed impatient, a tiny bit regettful. she giggled again and I
590 smiled.
591     she calmed quickly and said, "Why not give it a try?"
