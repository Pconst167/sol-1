137 I probably owe an apology to any/everybody for some of the (truly offensive)
138 stuff I've posted on here at times.  I don't even (re)read most of it myself,
139 which  IS the reason I, myself, don't read BackWater anymore and the reason
140 I don't respond to what anybody else has to say.  I AM truly shocked by the
141 death of Walter Hathaway and I've been "told" there is a comment on here that
142 I'm probably happy now that Evil Walt is gone.  If I'da known Walt had been
143 sick for the last year I might have limited my comments more to McElroy and
144 those henchmen more closely aligned to the police-state disciplinary practices
145 of the "executive branch" of the district.  From the photo in the paper, I'm
146 amazed I'd never recognized how much Walt looked like Mark Alport, whose name
147 I've been trying to remember for the last month and it didn't hit me until I
148 saw the picture.

151 Stray cat, you won't bother to read this of course, but I must respond anyway.
152 It was I who made the comment about Walt.  I must point out to you that it
153 is silly to say that you would have been more moderate in your criticism if
154 you had known he had been sick.  Perhaps you could have attributed some of
155 his actions to his sickness, but that is all.  
156  
157 It seems to me that there is almost always a reason for somebody doing 
158 something 'stupid' and it is rare that they do it meerly out of stupidity.
159  
160 Walt did some great things during his life.  He did some not so great things,
161 but who hasn't?  He helped generate a tremendose positive legacy.  You may
162 not believe that, but I do.  And only sickness over the last few years, and
163 the states budgetary problems have been able to dim that achievment.  But 
164 there are others who will carry on the good work.  And perhaps some day,
165 the hard work and good will will actually see the light of day again.
166  
167 If that day comes, I'll know that the ignorent and petty backstabers have
168 finally been overcome.  Heres to a brighter future.  One we will BUILD and
169 no destroy.

402    Where have all the stories gone?
403    Long time ago....
404  
405    For some reason, I have kept my original EnvironSuit story that I 
406 posted nearly two years ago.  I've worked on it a little, but it is
407 still very rough, and only takes about 5-7k of disk space.  If I have time
408 on my birthday, and there is enough disk space, I might upload it.
409 Alas, I have been sacked with the job of writing my department's manuals-
410 a tedious, time-consuming task (much like my job).  It leaves me little
411 time for improving it.
412  
413    In my hiatis, what has happened?  AD is one of the few that I 
414 recognize, but so much has changed.
415  
416   I'm planning to re-attend college, but I'm unsure about my previous
417 major in Computer Science.  That, and my mathematical skills only
418 rival a third-grader with dyslexia.  Even the most basic algebra 
419 problems seem to puzzle me; the last course I had was College Algebra
420 , along with another class in Logic.
421   I guess I'm looking for advice.  I don't have much in the way of 
422 monetary funds, but I should be able to go part-time in the day
423 (around 4-8 credit hours).  PCC supposedly is filled to the rim
424 with EVERYONE, but it's all I can afford.  Would PSU take a part-timer
425 like me?  Or any other college?  Reed seems like a great place, but
426 I'm not ready - and I might not be good material (Liberal Arts and
427 Computer Science don't mix well).  If you have any ideas, knowledge,
428 or (best of all) previous experience, please leave me a line or
429 send Mail to 498.  Thanks.

567 Measure 9 - Argument in favor
568  
569 According to the book of Levitcus in the Bible, oyster-eating, 
570 crossbreeding cattle, shaving a beard, wearing clothing made of 
571 mixed fibers, cursing one's parents and adultery are just as 
572 immoral as homosexuality. If the OCA's "No Special Rights" 
573 Committee wants to take one of the 3000 year old laws of ritual 
574 holiness from Levitcus and put it into the Bill of Rights in the 
575 state constitution, they should be sincere enough to put all the 
576 rest of Levitcus into the constitution as well. It's a simple 
577 matter of respect for these historic laws to treat them 
578 consistently.
579  
580 We at the Special Righteousness Committee are just as offended by 
581 oyster-eating, shaving and mixed fibers as the OCA is offended by 
582 homosexuality, and we have just as much right as the OCA does to 
583 change the state constitution to require government 
584 discrimination against people whose behavior we don't like.
585  
586 My friends, do you want the public schools teaching your children 
587 that shaving is a legitimate and equal alternative style to a 
588 normal and healthy beard? Would you want to be forced to hire an 
589 oyster-eater to direct your church choir? Adam and Eve wore fig 
590 leaves - 100% fig leaves - and this is divine proof that those 
591 disgustingly unnatural cotton/polyester blends are sinful. 
592  
593 And when the OCA was analyzing the threat to traditional family 
594 values, we don't know how they managed to overlook adultery! Why, 
595 there's a lot more adultery than homosexuality going on out 
596 there, and extrapolations from OCA statistics show that 90 
597 percent of the people who have engaged in sexual perversions are 
598 heterosexual ("straight").
599  
600 The state condones adultery by not punishing with death as 
601 required by Levitcus. It promotes oyster-eating by licensing 
602 seafood restaurants, and it allows people to take mixed fibers 
603 out of the closet and to flaunt them right out in public without 
604 being fired or evicted! The state is encouraging sin!
605  
606 If the OCA can have the special right to make their personal 
607 moral agenda into public policy, then anyone else also should be 
608 able to amend the state Bill of Rights to eliminate basic human 
609 rights for people who they don't like. 
610  
611 Let's put ALL of Levitcus into the constitution! A "yes" vote is 
612 the first step is facilitating our militant moral agenda.

675 Gaining justice and corecting wrongs is cool, but you're mental attitude
676 seems to be such that it causes you a great deal of stress.  Bad news
677 for your health.  So why don't you try adjusting your mental attitude?
678 Nothing is more important then your health.  If for no other reason then
679 the fact that the longer you are around, the more good work you can get done.
680  
681 And no, I'm not being snide or sarcastic.  Self interest plays a part here
682 though.  If you weren't so stressed all the time you might actually spend
683 sone time entering non negative stuff once in awhile.

703 As time goes by I start to wonder if we are alloted a certain number of words
704 to use during our lives.  And, what would happen if we used them all up.  
705 Perhaps when we start to get near the end of our supply we instinctivly
706 begin to conserve the few words we have left.

714 back to the mainland I think? Perhaps LA or some other sun-drenched southern

716 Social entropy has taken its toll. I haven't talked to voyeur in ages, though
717 for awhile I tried to remain in touch. Haven't seen or heard from mig in a long
718 time either. Leonard is still around and still causing trouble, just to be
719 "weird"... Milchar is now trying on a healthy glow at Lawrence Livermore
720 National Labs. We haven't done RISK in a long long time. Also, the pizza place
721 kicked us out due to lack of numbers. You see, everything remembered is dust
722 or getting there fast. Only BW remains a common thread throughout the past to
723 the present. 
724 If you would like a higher baud-rate connection, even (shudder) voice or one
725 of the many telepathic network paths, please tell me how to get ahold of you.
726 Even an L5 contained address/phone number could be handled on this end, as
727 I believe I still have all that stuff around...
728 Again good to hear from you. I pass by beefbend road all the time to play
729 tennis at OES, and I think fondly of global conquest, and of a forgotten
730 red army on the island fortress of Japan...

745 l'homme,
746 Indeed it is good to see that you still tend the hearth of our favorite Inn.
747 Often I have thought of those times as well....Long live the Red hoard.
748 Barb & I have an addition to the family (My alter ego is now 5 and his sister
749 is 3). All are doing well. I am in transition. We moved to L.A. in 90' and are
750 in the process of completing our triangle by the 20th of November (barring the
751 house falling out of escrow).  Much has changed here. I cannot believe the
752 sheer amount of dwellings that now scar the landscape..... But in any case
753 it is better to be here than Not!. 
754 Let's plan on getting together in the not too distant future. There is much
755 to catch up on.  I will be making the 935 mile jaunt to Magic Mountain on 
756 Thursday (10/22) or Friday (10/23) and will be gone 5 days to a week or so. 
757 If we can manage the time I will see you before I leave, If not after I get
758 back. The wizzards at GTE gave me a number that ended with XXX-5817, but
759 has been busy so far. I will keep trying. You can try the wizzards using the
760 first name of Thomas on Walker Rd. 
761 In any case it's good to hear from you.
762    I have yet to be able to pick up a bottle of VOL without a smile crossing
763 my face. It happens to be one of my sons favorite drinks.

785 OCA IS A FRAUD!
786  
787 By now almost everyone is familiar with the OCA, or Oregon Citizens Alliance.
788 OCA made its biggest impact with the passage of "Ballot Measure 8" overturning
789 an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals. OCA is also
790 active in the anti-abortion cause, although it can be argued that OCA is as
791 much an embarrassment for traditional anti-abortion groups as anything else.
792  
793 Other than its opposition to homosexuality and abortion, does OCA really stand
794 for anything? Let's look and see. The Oregon Citizens Alliance 'Statement of
795 Principles; states (see "The Oregon Alliance", August 1989):
796  
797                 We believe that the form of government established
798                 by the Constitution needs no revision. We also
799                 believe that the Constitution should be read,
800                 interpreted and taught according to the original
801                 construction and intent of the founders. ...
802                 Discrimination based on race, religion, or
803                 national origin, or arbitrary discrimination based
804                 on gender is indefensible. Such discrimination
805                 should be prohibited by law. ...
806                 We believe that the goal of American civil rights
807                 policy should be a race-unconscious society.
808  
809 One question: just what degree of deceit, deception, and contempt for
810 historical truth is required in order to write the contradictory statements
811 above into a set of "principles?" The framers of the Constitution obviously
812 did discriminate, and intended to discriminate, on both race and gender, and
813 they even discriminated on national origin in that a naturalized citizen of
814 the United States could not be President. As to a "civil rights policy"
815 leading to a "race-unconscious soceity" - one may confidently state that the
816 framers would now be rolling in their graves. It is also relevant to mention
817 that the original (1857) Constitution of Oregon was even more explicit on
818 the race issue. For example, Article 2, Section 6 stated that "No Negro,
819 Chinaman, or Mulatto shall have the right of suffrage."
820  
821 Another example of the OCA contradicting the original intent of the founders
822 of our country is their statement about Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan
823 (The Oregon Alliance, December 1991):
824  
825                 When asked on what issues OCA differed with
826                 Buchanan, [OCA Chairman Lon Mabon] cited two
827                 examples, "While we don't believe that Buchanan
828                 is anti-Israel, he is not considered a great ally
829                 of Israel. On the other hand, OCA is strongly
830                 pro-Israel, and not quite as isolationistic as
831                 Buchanan."
832  
833 In spite of warnings by our founders to stay clear of foreign entaglements,
834 OCA is judging a candidate by how closely he aligns himself with a foreign
835 state. Also, while most of our nation's founders were Christian, OCA is
836 apparently not a Christian organization, but rather, by its own admission,
837 Judeo-Christian. Again, from OCA's 'Statement of Principles':
838  
839                 Public education should have as one of its primary
840                 goals the transmission and affirmation of traditional
841                 American, Judeo-Christian moral and ethical values
842                 to future generations. ...Judeo-Christian religious
843                 values historically have had, and should continue
844                 to have, an important role to play in shaping
845                 American values, goals and policies.
846  
847 So exactly what is this Judeo-Christian religion? Call OCA and perhaps
848 they can recommend a good Judeo-Christian church (?) in your neighborhood.
849 In any case, it seems extremely doubtful that any Judeo-Christians signed
850 either the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence.
851  
852 What is the OCA really up to? OCA is led by an arrogant group of over-
853 inflated egos, who are gaining power and publicity by fraudulently playing on
854 legitimate concerns about homosexuals and abortion. Yet a particularly
855 pathetic example of OCA's tactics was its highly publicized support of
856 "hate-crime" legislation (a close relative of Orwellian "thought crime").
857 A respected conservative figurre, Cal Thomas of the now-defunct Moral
858 Majority, attacked such laws in a syndicated column, "How can we define 'hate
859 crimes'?" Thomas remarked, on President Bush's support of hate-crime
860 legislation, "If Republicans continue to mimic Democrats on moral issues,
861 they risk losing the social conservatives who have helped them hold the
862 White House." OCA's support of "hate-crime" legislation, blatantly pandering
863 to the left-wing, anti-White forces in an attempt to defuse its critics, is
864 a perfect example of the OCA's willingness to sacrifice all principles of
865 logic in an attempt to improve its publicity. Regardless of what mis-
866 interpretations you may see in the newspapers and on television, don't
867 confuse the goals of the OCA with those of any legitimate Constitutionalist
868 organizations or White-Racialist Nationalist groups. The OCA has no goals,
869 beyond the aggrandizement and enrichment of its leaders.

912 It seems to me that to ofteen the animal part of us gains dominance.  And
913 what could possibly be devine about that?  What is fear and hatrid after all,
914 but base emotion?  And are not unreasoning fear and hatrid even closer to 
915 the animal?
916  
917 Do we not have the ability to reason and thus understand?  Why then would
918 anyone be so foolish as to ignore these gifts?  Is there anythng noble
919 in going through life with a self imposed moral labotomy?  
920  
921 Far better it would be if we were to glory only in those things that 
922 seperate us from the unthinking animal.
923  
924 Let us be seperate, but not apart.  Let us understand that self deception
925 is both foolish and deadly.  Let us find in ourselves the strength to
926 know whats right and do it.  
927  
928 Because at the end, whatever you might believe of what comes after, 
929 You will become a part of the history of this world.  A fragmant of the
930 collective gestalt that is everything and everyone.  And some small 
931 part of you will live on forever.  There are many things you may aspire
932 to, but I doubt vomit is one of them.

944    Anyway, to make my previous verbage shorter, I feel that they are
