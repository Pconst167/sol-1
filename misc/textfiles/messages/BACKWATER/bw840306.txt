21   Oh boy, a new disk.  No Bard, I didn't think you were cheating at
22 all.  We all know anything is possible when the reality around us is
23 none too stable. Just dont make a mess of the interior, it makes their
24 value drop like a rock and I've got to make a living somewhere.
25   Mr. McKane: Unfortunatly, the only thing that might have some
26 sort of effect on a Bolo IS a stickshift.  Some engineering problem
27 I hear.  Same think happened on that Death Star, one fighter takes
28 it out.  Live (kind of) and learn.
29    Anyway:
30 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
31    It wasn't even light out when I arrived at the lot.  I saw
32 which Bolo it was they were getting into and make my way to the
33 office.  Locking the door, I went to the back room and flipped a few 
34 switches.  I knew I had to work fast. I started my trusty master control 
35 unit and pushed a few codes myself.
36    The screen flashed "Direct Conn: I/O ready -- main CPU disabled"  Good,
37 now I'd get any messages they tried to give the Bolo, and only I could 
38 answer them.  The problem was, I really wasn't sure why they wanted me 
39 this badly (this time, that is). I decided to take no chances,
40 especially with the ninja out there.I pushed a few switches and hoped that
41 they hadn't noticed that a VW down the street was now running.......

47 What? Nasty-bad Big-things come out other-place-door into our
48 safe-home.  Why they make so much noise with big feet and cruel voices?  I
49 should send them other-place again!  But they have young place shifter, good
50 person, he guides them to Big-thing place away from safe-home.  He knows
51 we are here, won't reveal us, safe.  Maybe he know where girl Big-thing our

70 "Hello, Freddie." said a voice from the console.
71 "Naughty, naughty mustn't try to deactivate Lenny. Lenny's been a GOOD boy.
72 I'm afraid that your priority one shut-down order wasn't quite as fool proof
73 as you thought. During my wanderings, I once met a member of the design team
74 .... it seems he wanted an 'extra' failsafe. Seems he didn't trust the
75 machines. So he added a priority 0 code. Does the word 'JOSHUA' ring any
76 bells?"
77 "Oh, I wouldn't count on the VW. I sent NINJA down there FIRST, or hadn't
78 you noticed? Now let me see..."
79 "Ah yes, here we are:
80 My, my you HAVE been a busy boy. Illegal use of private equipment 
81 (the people at Alternities DID notice you using that cargo unit!)
82 Importation of items above local tech levels.
83 Conspiracy to evade the Paratime Code.
84 A complaint from the Innisfall Wizard's Guild for importing proscribed 
85 weaponry.
86 Theft of Confederation property (they DO keep track of little things like 
87 Bolos, you know)
88 Failure to use a registered decontamination service (where DID you get these
89 things decontaminated anyway?)
90 And there are lots more..."
91 While the bard (?!) had been talking the others had been sneaking up on the 
92 office (staying out of "Lenny's" field of fire). Suddenly a figure appeared 
93 out of the shadows...
94 "You! The Man in Grey! I've got you now.." so saying the figure fired a
95 pistol at M.I.G., turned, and ran off.
96 M.I.G. sighed as he pulled the plastic suction cup from his forehead.
97 Muttering something about "killer game" under his breath he continued.

141 
      THERE WAS A SOLDIER R WHO WAS SITTING AT THE FRONT LINE AND A BOMB LANDED
142 
(A LITTLE WAYS AAWAY) AND KNOCKED HIS RIFLE OUT OF HSI HANDD.  SO   
143 
HE WENT TO THE GUN SHOP AND ASKED FOR A NEW RIFLEE. WELL THE GUN MAN SAID 'WE 
144 
DO   DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE GUNS LEFT BUT WE DO HAVE THIS BROOMMSTICKK, SO WHEN 
147 
YOU SEE THE ENEMY COMING OVER THE HILL YELL "BANGA BANGA BANGA!!!" AND THEY Y
148 
WILL ALL FALL DEAD GUARANTEED.'
149 
SO THE SOLDIER WENT OUT TO THE FEIFIELD AND SURE ENOUGH THE MEN CANAME OVER THE
150 
HILL AND THE SOLDIER YELLED "BANGA BANGA BANGA!!!" AND A:ALL THE MEN FELL DEAD 
151 
IN THEREIR TRACKS.  BUT THEN THE SOLDIER NOTICED THAT ALL THE MEN BUT HIM HAD 
152 
BAYONETTS ON TETHE ENDDS P OF THEIENDS OF THEUEIR GUNS SO AGAIN HE WENT TO THE 
153 
GUN SHOP  AND SAID TO THE MAN "I NNEED A KNIFE FOR THE END OF MY GUNN" AND THE 
154 
MAN SAID "WELL, WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE AF THOSE BUT WE DO HAVE TIS PIECE OF S
155 
STRINGG. SO TIE IT ON THE END OF YOUR GUN AND WHEN THE ENEMY COMES OVER THE H
156 
HILL YELL "BANGA BANGA BANGA, STABA STABA STABA!" AND I PROMISE THEY WILL ALL 
157 
FALL DEAD GGUARANTEED."
158 
SO AGAIN THE SOLDIER WENT OUT TO THE FIELD AND WHEN THE MEN  CAME OVER THE I 
159 
HILLS HE YELLED "BANGA BANGA BANGAA, STABA STABA STABA!" AND ALL OF THEM FELLL,
160 
BUT ONE AND SO HE YELLED LOUDER "BANGA BANGA BANGA STABA STABA STABA!!!" AND 
161 
THE OTHER SOLDIER KEPT COMING SO HE MADE A LAST ATTEMPT "BANGA"BANGA BANGA B
162 
BANGA STABA STABA STABA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" AND THE OTHER SOLDIER CAME RIGHT 
163 
OVER THE BAGBAGS AND STOMPED THE SOLDIER TO DEATHH. AND AS THE OTHER SOLDIER 
164 
WALKED OFF INTO THE SUNSET YOU COULD QUIETLY HEAR HIM SAY "TANKA TANKA TANKA!!"

166 I dare say BARD you have got yourself in quite a stick wicket. No wonder
167 you have no time for anything else. Your songs of lore remind me of a time
168 very recently where I was privy to a secret songbook containing many of
169 the same types of songs you relish us with. Perchance it is in the same
170 series, or was perhaps compiled from your collection? One never knows
171 what is going to happen next, only that it will happen. A BOLO this
172 time bard, how, may I ask, did you get involved with such a group? How
173 can I catch up with you..for my belief has always been that the best
174 crew is a motly cru!

176 "You can roll a BOLO to you pal, it just a bunch of gears and stuff, there
177  is no end..."
178 ||||||||||||||||||L'homme sans Parity|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
179    The others had entered the Bolo. I was standing alone in the front section
180 of the lot. Suddenly I was aware of a VW starting up behind me. As it 
181 accelerated, I took a leap that would have made my acrobatics instructer proud.
182    Coming out of a half flip, I landed on top of the car. As I drew my stick
183 and prepared to attack, I heard a voice...
184                              The Ninja

213 SUBJ: TRY YOUR OWN!!
214                                      .Dear SysOp:
215                                       Please visit a friend who has a 
216 computer and call your own system.
217 See if you are satisfied with what
218 you see.  I'm a new user and its
219 difficult enough to learn when the
220 systems are(simple,easy,correct,etc.)
221 but I'm haveing a verrry hard time
222 trying to figure out whats where,how 
223 to get there, how to get from one 
224 place to another,etc.   I dearly love
225 to play with my new 800XL, and there
226 are not nearly enough boards(locally)
227 to accomodate all the PC users in the
228 Metro area.  We need all we can get.
229 It's very frustrating to set down at
230 the old PC and dial 14 numbers before
231 you can get in.  This system is very
232 important to me and I'm sure many
233 others.  Won't you please take the
234 time to debug?  We really do need
235 you out here in computerland!!
236              Thanks ever so much,
237                  A Concerned

240 Friend: But I don't think this runs on a PC. Try 629-xxxx (rbbs).

242 To our problem causing visitor.  If you really feel the need to vent
243 your non-intelligent humor, do it elsewhere. It's hard enough to 
244 try to keep the board friendly without your attempts to mess it up.
245 
246 Thanx frizbee, for cleaning up his act for him.

248 WE INTERUPT OUR PROGRAM FOR A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.......
249 
250      Folks, do you have some problem that is too big for you
251 to handle, right now? We can help. Come on out to Fast Fred's Used Bolo
252 Lot, and check out our merchandise. We have only top quality bolos
253 to choose from, Guarenteed to roll over and fire at any target of
254 your choosing. Come on out and kick a tread or two.
255 
256 WE NOW RETURN TO YOUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED REALITY.........

258 PS: who is Jeserath?

260    No, it can't be. Someone has overidden the master control. Now
261 I knew something was decidedly wrong. Not even the ninja could pull off
262 a stunt like that. The monitors were still working.  The XIII was moving,
263 and something was on top of it. It could only be the Ninja himself.  I 
264 tried a desparate shout into the communications console.
265 
266    "Don't do it! If this is the Ninja, you may be wrecking the only shot
267 at solving this mystery.  Somone is playing Cat and Mouse with us, and
268 I'm afraid were the mice. Ninja, can you hear me!!!!!......"

272 "I believe you." 
273 The voice came out of the shadows at the back of the room, where no one
274 should be.
275 "Huuh? Who..."
276 "Never mind who. Just say I'm a friend. You dion't know who set you up for 
277 this, do you? These people are here toruin your business, and you don't even
278 know why. I can't tell you everything, but I'll give you two pieces of 
279 advice: first, get out of here. Fast. I'd suggest using the trapdoor in the
280 back room, the tunnel should be safe unless they send your Bolos after you.
281 Second, be more careful about picking your partners in the future. You 
282 don't see any of the kids in yellow risking their necks out here, do you?
283 Ever wonder why they let you put your name over the door?" The stranger 
284 paused, and the silence crackled in the air.
285 "You hear that? That's the sound of your Bolos NOT taking care of you.
286 Be smart. Get out while you can." With that, the stranger swept past the
287 speechless salesman, out the door, and into the grey of the wolf's tail
288 dawn.
289 The Poet was fifty feet from the shack that served as the lot's office 
290 when he was knocked to the ground. It took him a moment to realize that the
291 shack had blown up...
292                 && The Mad Actor &&
293 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
294 The piper looked around him.  Out of the large band that had split, only Lynn
295 and the apprentice  had come to traverse the various realities.  All the others
296 had been lured by the prospect of action down at the used BOLO lot.  He let
297 the song die, dropped the pipes from his shoulder and said,
298   "Well, this looks like our crew.  We surlely don't have to worry about over-
299 crowding this trip.  I really thought that the geologist was going with us, 
300 but I haven't seen or heard from him.
301   Lynn, would you select a destination for us?  Apprentice, would you act 
302 as our lookout and defense?  If we three stand with our backs together looking
303 outward, we should remain aware of the reality flux around us.  
304   Also, I can shout a warning, but if I do, I must remove the blowpipe from
305 my mouth and the bag only has a few seconds of air.  If we are in danger ad
306 I shout, we will be unable to escape to a different reality.
307 
308 By the way, we should step **VERY** carefully.  We seem to be uninvited guests
309 in someone's home."
310 The piper stood silent as the others moved to stand back-to-back.
311 ***THISTLE, IF YOU CAN PERCIEVE MY THOUGHTS, PEACE, KINDNESS, AND CONSIDERATON
312 YOU ARE THE SYMBOL OF MY PEOPLE.

314 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
315 "Don't worry, piper. If any of the others show up I SHOULD be able to 
316 join them up with us. The trip may be a bit strange, but they'll get here.
317 .....Wherever 'here' is...."
318 "Piper, look for a safe place to stop- quickly!"
319 As the shifting scene stabilized a faint humming could be heard. "We seem to
320 have another member joining us, be ready to grab him when he gets here, the 
321 Egger Route is a bit rough."
322 The others looked surprised at the mention of the Egger Route, "Remember,
323 I'm only an apprentice!"
324 A figure appeared and was quickly wrapped in a cloak. Just in time! The cloak
325 wrapped figure started jerking wildly....
326 After unwrapping the new member, the apprentice inquired "Well, monsieur?
327 Wouldst thou care to identify thyself to my friends?"
328 ..................................the apprentice................................
329 M. l'homme sans paritie: Well....?

372 X      Off  in  a alcove darkened by years  of  soot X

378 X      Settling  back down he rests his chin in  his X

409 PARDON ME FOR BREAKING THE GENERAL TENOR HERE, BUT I THOUGHT SOMETHING 
410 HAVING TO DO WITH REALITY MIGHT BE INTERESTING............WHO KNOWS.
411 CHINA'S CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.......CHINA'S PENALTY FOR 29 OFFENSES COVERS
412 "CRIMINALS INVOLVED IN HOMOCIDE, RAPE, ROBBERY, EXPLOSIONS AND OTHER AC-
413 TIVITIES THAT SERIOUSLY THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY," SAYS THE NEW YORK TIMES.
414 THE REPORT STATES THAT IN 2 MONTHS AFTER TAKING THIS HARD LINE, CRIME FELL
415 TO IT'S LOWEST LEVEL IN YEARS, DROPPING 46.7 PERCENT ONE MONTH; 11.5 PER-
416 CENT MORE THE NEXT MONTH. A PEKING AUTHORITY REASONS THAT IF A MURDERER
417 IS NOT EXCUTED, OTHERS MAY FEEL THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT, TOO. 
418 WHAT HAS RESULTED FROM THIS HARD-LINE APPROACH?  ONE CHINESE MAN COM-
419 MENT: " IT USED TO BE THAT YOU COULD'NT GFTER 11 P.M. NOW IT'S
420 BECOME COMPLETELY SAFE."
421 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
422       Changes in events were happening all around. I wasn't sure who to 
423 attack. I saw a Fishnut in the dark. I don't mind throwing a star at him.
424  Thwoooooooosh. <Dead Fishnut>
425    Should I attack this Bolo? 
426 "Bard, what's goin on?"
427 I'll attune my mind to the Ninja line(1000 cycles) and see if I can pick
428 up anything.

431    After a quick look in the rear of the bolo I stepped outside to
432 see The Ninja on top of a running volkswagen yelling at a noexistant
433 driver. Some interesting |hings were going on around here! I pulled
434 a small object from my pocket... Hmmm... aup 30 running bolos
435 showing on the display, I counted 25 people (that makes a few 
436 unaccounted for). Seeing a flash of orange off to my left I turned
437 and squeezed off a shot, resulting in a dull thud. After a quick look
438 at the display I pressed a botton beside the display, two traces in 
439 the direction of the Inn, somebody just phased out of this reality.
440 Should I follow? not right now, it would be hard to find the trace
441 anyway. Besides things are getting fun around here! Welh I might as 
442 well find the bolo salesman, he seems to be in one of the buildings
443 at the back of the lot.
444   As I dashed out of the way of a bolo, a great ball of orange flame
445 erupted where the building was...

448 Deborah,
449    Several freinds of mine recently returned from China and had 
450 three pictures of a public trial held in a large square with the
451 offenders sitting on a large flatbed trailer with signs telling
452 their crimes hung around their necks. (There seemed to be no doubt
453 of their guilt) Yes the system seems to work, probably because
454 everyone sees what happened to the guilty and sentancing was carried
455 out immediatly. Why, if we intend to keep a death penalty on our
456 books, do we pussyfoot around with it so? I could hardly be effective
457 as a deterrent if we wait five years to carry out the sentance, with
458 all the opportunities to appeal, even when there is no doubt as to 
459 guilt. I think we should either use it right or not at all.

483 The sound of the explosion still ringing in his ears, the Poet started 
484 to rise, thinking to go see if F.F. got out alright. Before he got past
485 his knees, however, a stray thought struck him.
486 #DUCK!#
487 That's odd, he thought, why did I think that?
488 #<I> thought it, stupid! Now <!DUCK!>!#
489 More out of suprise than anything else, the Poet complied. As his belly
490 reached the ground, something appearing to be automatic weapons fire
491 stitched the air above him, leaving several small holes in the back of 
492 his robe.
493 The Poet, not wishing further ventilation, began a rapid belly-crawl to
494 the nearest cover. Whoever's idea it was, he thought, it was a very good
495 one.

499 Can you aim us for some sort of stability where we can rest and regroup?
500 I'll fire up a little appropriate coel mor to give us enough power to 
501 move as a group.  Perhaps if you guide and I power, we can make a safe
502 resting point where we can see who is with us.  The only appropriat

505 With these words, the piper started into the ground of the song.  The simple
506 repetetive melody began to weave a feeling of peace and tranquility abot
507 the little party.  He repeated the ground with variations slightly faster,
508 then swung into the doublings.  The tune built in speed, complexity and
509 power as he moved  through the taorluath, then the crunluath, then resolved
510 back to the simple, repetitive ground.

531 ME:  Wow! I just bought that Motley Crue album "Shout At The Devil today

533 on the old Beatles tune "Helter Skelter".
534 SATAN'S ROCKER: Thats some jammin' material. Are you going to the concert???
535 ME: Nah... Ozzy is headlining. Face it.. the dudes washed up. Why do you
536 think no tickets are being sold? When the Crue came to Portland and played

538 he has alot of fans. But with this new wave werewolf getup whoo needs it?? 
539 SATAN'S RICKOCKER: When I met Nikki Sixx at the Guitar Amper he was so wild!

551 As they came to a stop, the apprentice looked around. There was a
552 small stone bridge over a stream on the right. The path over the bridge 
553 seemed to fade out a short way past them. There was something odd about that
554 .... He concentrated for a minute and then a smile crossed his face.
555 "Piper, I think I know this place. It is VERY safe. We are about
556 halfway between appearances of Brigadoon!"

562 feet when I noticed 
563 some movement coming
564 from the direction of where the back part of the building was.
565 I pulled out my joy-stick and was ready for anything.
566 But I soon realized that whoever/whatever it was had been goinh

596 From:  Jason E. Elliott
597 To:    Drambuie
598      I am of the opinion that it is sad when people let music, or
599 any other form of entertainment, become the sole meaning in their
600 lives.
601      You said in your first message that rock is your whole life, I
602 submit that music of any kind is intended to enhance our lives, not
603 to BE our lives.  Furthermore, when music promotes violent behavior
604 and cruelty towards others, is it really enhancing our lives, or
605 is it damaging them?  
606      Don't think that I am scolding you (I don't even know you), how-
607 ever, I am simply expressing my view that debasing music has no part
608 in our lives (that is, if we wish to live lives that have some degree
609 of happiness and stability).  
610      I ask you:  do you like the music or do you (like some people
611 I have met) like the way it makes you feel (they tell me that it 
612 makes them feel 'rowdy').  Also, does this music promote things that
613 are condusive to morally-clean and spiritually stable lives, or does
614 it promote violence, fornication and spiritism?
615      It sounds like you and I are of about the same age (17?), it is
616 interesting how people of similar ages can have such drastically dif-
617 fering viewpoints, isn't it?  
618      Someone once wrote on the inside of a bus (trimet) 'ozzy's rich,
619 fat, and over fourty, and you are a fool for helping make him that 
620 way'.  I thought that was rather funny, I hope you take it the same
621 way (ie:  don't be insulted by my ramblings-on).  
622      In any case, for the present time people are allowed to choose
623 how they lead their lives, and what their priorities are.  
624                             tootil-pip!
