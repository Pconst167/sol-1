45     What manor of place is this the robed figure wondered to himself.  So near
46 something called the top of a disc.
47     A what?  In the dim light of scented tapers and an inviting fire-place
48  he was able to make out a few vaguely familiar faces.  The wooden chair in
49 which he seated himself had a satisfying firmness of reality.  Too long had
50 he drifted, with other of the 'guru's' fallowers in realms less tangable. 
51     Even the road dust which clung about his brown and green robes had an 
52 aura of intangability: half translucent as if uncertain of its own substance.
53     So many things change, so many things stay the same.  There was a rabbit
54 on one of the tables who some how reminded him of a certain othe anthropomorph
55 from a mythical island contenant on one of the alternate urdthias he had yet
56 to visit.
57     Thankfull for the moment for a calm place to sit quietly, Uvje decided
58 to wait, observing, to see what would next transpire in this legendary sanctom.

65   All pain is not of the physical body.  Far deeper is the anguish that
66 proceeds from within.  The whips and scourges with which we flagellate
67 ourselves draw far deeper blood than even the keen blade of a knife near
68 an uncertain beating heart.
69   The woman whom we know only as ZEB swam up from dark unconciousness like
70 a fish moving toward the dappled surface of a stream.  As though it were
71 a trout leaping in some still woodland pool, her mind breached the barrier
72 and became aware of an external reality -- a reality twisted and warped,
73 but recognizable from what had gone before.
74   A face, recognizable as such.
75   Concern.
76   Smiles and encouragement.
77   "Are you alright?"
78   "Yes..."
79 
80   Above all, the wound, biting deep into secret flesh, protecting the heart
81 nearly bared to the cold world outside.  Below and underlying, the guilt.
82 With a gasp of exhaustion, she reluctantly gave up her grip on conciousness.
83 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

93    "Ahhhhh!" Cragmore could barely cry out before he fell to the floor of the
94 Pell-mell is a disorderly head. Emu and Trainor rushed to his side, confusion
95 and concern marked on their faces.
96    "What is the matter friend?" Trainor asked gently, as he and Emu tried
97 to make order of Cragmore's limbs and torso. Cragmore was conscious, and
98 he did not seem to draw back from the efforts of the others to make him
99 more comfortable. Finally, Emu and Trainor managed to lift up Cragmore and
100 take him into the commons room, where they carefully placed him on one of
101 the cushioned seats.
102    After several more moments of strained silence, Cragmore finally spoke.
103 "A voice, cutting through my mind like a hot knife through butter. It
104 screamed in pain and terror, then it was silence, save a stentorian echo
105 that still rings in my mind's ear. Something terrible has happened. We
106 can not stay here. To stay is to die. I know this to be true now."
107    Emu and Trainor exchanged startled looks. "Cragmore, we still aren't
108 sure where we are. We have been pulled through one portal into another
109 realm. I am surprised the Pell-mell still operates given the pounding
110 she has taken and the realities she has transcended."
111    "I guess you built them Ford-tough, Trainor." Emu joked, but his
112 humor fell on deaf ears.
113    Cragmore sat up, the color returning to his cheeks. "What we have been
114 through is nothing compared to what we will go through if we don't leave
115 this area, whatever it may be. There is a foreboding quintessence here, a 
116 presence of oppression and death. It is taking a large part of my energy
117 to fight off this feeling of doom."
118    Trainor was about to speak when another scream permeated the ship. This
119 scream was for all to hear, not just those with trained sensitive minds. It
120 came from one of the private rooms. So loud and long was this scream that
121 Piper, for the first time since his return to the ship, stirred from his
122 catatonic state, and began to awake. In the far corner, Bard seemed to
123 come out of his self-imposed solitude.
124    "Lady Tayree!" Emu gasped. "It must be her."
125    Not another word was needed as the five adventurers advanced to the rear
126 of the Pell-mell. Everyone was glad to see Piper alive and apparently well,
127 but at the moment, the blood curdling scream and its cause was foremost on
128 everyone's mind.

140      Eating my truffle, which wasn't magic, I waited for this cloaked 
141 figure to speak, move, or do something that might register life.  
142      A strange thing, though.  This cloaked figure didn't comply with
143 any of my senses.  It was as if the figure wasn't there, but sight said
144 otherwise....

149    "It's nice to see my reputation has preceded me," James said. And then he added sourly, "Even if it does sometimes
150 backfire. I'm not a monster, for crissakes, so mellow out. How do you know me, anyway?"
151    Tariya managed to regain some of her calm. "Among the mystics you are very well known. The ruling class of Kadan,
152 the Circle of Twelve has been very concerned about you. Especially after the battle of Earth Prime. They say..." she
153 gulped and hesitated for a moment. "They say you have the power to shatter the Circle, and doom our planet. They are
154 afraid of you."
155    Needless to say, James was rather taken aback by this. Why would he threaten some pissant little planet that he had
156 never even heard of? And they surely must not be much if they were so afraid of him in the first place. Sure, he had a
157 dangerous reputation but wrecking civilizations was a little out of his line. Something rang false here. "Now really.
158 Do I look all that dangerous to you?"
159    "No." she said cautiously. "But you don't have to. I can sense your power from here. You ARE the Destroyer. I
160 believe that. Still..." She laughed, a little embarassed. "Please forgive me. It was just my first reaction. The
161 Circle has a whole world's population in terror of you but I never really believed it."
162    "Hmmf." James grunted, not impressed. He didn't know what was going on here but he was sure he didn't care. He had
163 enough problems right now. "I think we're agreed I'm not going to kick over your planet. Fine. You said you could help
164 me find these people, but I'd kinda like to know what you're getting out of this."
165    Tariya considered for a moment, then decided on the truth. "Why, adventure, of course. I left Kadan because it's
166 the most boring planet it the universe. For years my spirit has longed for excitement! And now I heard rumors of a
167 quest and I want to join it! Surely you can understand that?"
168    "You have got to be kidding." James was trying to comprehend what he had just heard. "You have GOT to be kidding!
169 You have any idea what you're talking about? Any at all? You're nuts!"
170    She wasn't bothered by this at all. She'd heard it before. "Perhaps I am. But I am the only one who can help you
171 find the adventurers. Maybe you'd care to tell me why YOU want to join the quest."
172    "Me? Why, I, uh," He hesitated, and then burst out laughing. "Good point. Lately I've been wandering just to keep
173 the dust off. Since my old home is just a pile of rocks floating through space I haven't found a place yet that I'd
174 care to settle down in. Still, I have my doubts about you..."
175    The both jumped a little as the front door of the inn slammed open. Squeezing around a steamroller that was stalled
176 right in front of the doorway outside, four big, obnoxious, and very drunk men made their way inside. The inkeeper
177 groaned, "Not again," and sank from sight behind the counter.

222 tires on the rear wheels and a muffler dragging on the ground (let's not
223 mention the various electronic components, such as the radio, hazard light
224 or brake lights, that are not quite functional).  Was that a cop in the

230       Deciding to take maters into hand after all, robes shimmering, Uvje 
231 made his way to ware Zepher war truffle munching.
232       "Thanks" he said, reaghing for one of the not quite magic edables.  
233       "A mutual aquantance told me ware to find you.  Intercepted a message
234 you were trying to send a while back but wasn't quick enough to catch the 
235 coordinates of its destination.  A certain ambasador Themnax, I believe you've
236 heard the name.  Anyway if you've got those coordinates I believe trans-
237 portation to thair general vacinity might be arrainged.  I am told that from
238 certain other intercepted transmissions there may be some urgancy in the matter
239 ".
240      As he was speaking, the robed stranger pulled from a side pocket a 
241 portable hole generator, an objec resembling in other contexts a pocket cal-
242 culator but only slightly.  Here it seemed only a bizare talisman but keying
243 the proper sequence a hole appeared to hover virticaly in space nearby.  
244      Satisfied he turned it back off and sliped it back into a concieled 
245 pocket.

249   Once again, the darkness within her skull fades back to reveal a glimpse of
250 the outside world.  Eyelids slide back over the surface of the eye, alowing
251 glimpses of the surroundings to fill the mind.
252   WRONG!! WRONG!!  WRONG!!
253   Mental alarms sound.  Something is horribly wrong -- things are somehow
254 completely wrong or distorted.  Hands reach, hoping for comfort as the
255 blackness within the skull engulfs the slippery mind.
256   With returning conciousness comes minimal understanding.  A woman's face
257 bends over, concern written on her features.  The mind, undaunted by the
258 will, makes forays off into strange trails.  The voice, rusty from disuse
259 speaks.
260   "Who are you?"
261   The face, concern written on it, "Tayree -- lie quietly now."
262   The mind, wandering, looking at youth and beauty, refuses to be quelled,
263 forces the voice to ask the question.
264   "How long has it been since you died?"

301 ...........................................................................
302         Seeing the Inkeeper duck behind the counter, the apprentice looked
303 for the reason. Seeing the four men he shhok his head.
304         He muttered a spell under his breath and approached them.
305         "Ah! You are here to remove the machine." It was a statement, not
306 a question. For the barest instant they started to bristle, but then the
307 spell took effect.
308         "we are here to remove the machine" they repeated tonelessly.
309         "Just haul it to the Jonas the smith down at the port. You may keep
310 half of what he pays you for it."
311 ...............................the apprentice..............................
312 I'm sure the smith will *love* all that scrap metal. And when the charm
313 wears of in a week or two....
314 ...........................................................................
315 ?????????????????//////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\??????????????
316       It wasn't quite dawn.  The only sound to be heard was the rustling
317 of alfalfa.  Occasionally a nicker or a whinny would echo through the
318 stable area as to say "Thanks for breakfast" or "Where's mine".
319       Soon the grounds will be alive with nervous participants, anxious
320 trainers and curious spectators.  For this is the opening day of the
321 State Championship Horse Show, a week of long hours for both equestrian
322 and steed.  Seven days of excitement and heartbreak, frustration and
323 anticipation.  For grooms like myself it's a week of hard work and
324 tension.  Of the hundreds of horses here twenty-five of these majestic
325 creatures are mine to keep fed, happy and ready to go at a seconds
326 notice.  A simular number of riders are also in my care.  From four
327 am to 1:00am for the next week I am at their becon call.
328       In the distance I hear a small scooter coming in this direction
329 followed closely by the clicking of hooves.  To the normal spectator
330 seeing someone on a scooter leading a horse is quite a strange sight,
331 but to a groom like myself it is a common occurance.  When working
332 five arenas spread over a 200 acre sight you need all the advantages
333 you can get.
334       As the sun rises, a light layer of fog is revealed hugging close
335 to the ground.  I wander down the long row of stalls to notice that
336 my favorite is ready to go out for his morning warm-up.  I reach for
337 the lead while he nuzzles me with his warm nose.  Steam rises as
338 his breath hit the cold air outside.  Finally he allows me to attach
339 the lead to the small ring under his chin.  He is a large Thoroughbred,
340 with a jet black mane and tail and a body the colour of mahogany.  To
341 the family of Baywood Canyon Ranch he is known only as Ralph but to
342 the world of Class 'A' competition, he is known as "The Tower of Power",
343 one of the best Hunter/jumpers in the show circut.
344       With a quick stop by the tack room for a longe line, it's off
345 to the closest arena.  Once I attach the thirty foot cord off he goes.
346 The horses all know that being at the end of this long tether is a 
347 time for childlike behavior and silliness.  Tower is no exception.
348 Instantly he is off at a gallop stopping only for the chance to kick
349 up his heels and leap for the stars.  At times it is hard for me to
350 believe that only a slight tug on the line will bring him down to
351 earth and ready for a serious work out.  But this morning I will let
352 him play as long as time will allow for it is soon to be show time
353 and no playing will be tolerated then.   Although we were the first to
354 enter the field quickly it swells with other grooms and their playful
355 companions.  
356       And so the day begins.  The work has only just begun.
357 ??//\\??
358 more later
359 ??????????????\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\////////////////////????????????????
360 So I walk up to Tower, this magnificent horse, and say "ahh, that's a good
361 boy, you're a fine horse indeed!"
362 He whinnies... and I hear a voice!"
363 "Thank you!"
364 I turn in amazement... "Who said that?"
365 "I did" comes the firm reply.
366 I looked at Tower.... no, it couldn't be... "Tower? ...is th-that you?"
367 His glorious mane ruffles in the wind as he shakes his head up and down.
368 My mind wanders back to the time I first met him... I had looked at his 
369 genealogy charts. "Madame Rosa" was his mother, a fine mare that one... but
370 who was his father? Hmmmm
371 Suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks! I couldn't believe it! No! It 
372 couldn't be! Nothing on TV was true... but yet! Wait! My voice trembled...
373 "...Are you really... the SON of... MISTER ED??????"

391    "What do you mean, 'doubts about me'?" Tariya wanted to know. "What kind of doubts?"
392    The four drunks were having a loud argument in the background but neither of them were paying attention. James
393 said, "Well, to be quite honest, I have no idea if you can watch out for yourself. Adventures can be dangerous things
394 and I really haven't the time or the inclination to watch out for you."
395    Tariya was outraged, of course. "I've been trained in the arcane arts since I could walk and can damned well take
396 care of myself!" She held out her hand and suddenly a pinpoint of light appeared in her palm. It was brighter than a
397 welding arc and James couldn't look at it directly. She closed her fist and suddenly it was encircled in miniature
398 lightning bolts.
399    "Impressive." James said, not impressed at all. The argument was getting closer. "Pretty lights do not a defense
400 make, though. I've faced threats that would laugh at something like that. I don't doubt that you could do more, but
401 could you handle a high pressure confrontation?"
402    "Of course I can. I-" She stopped suddenly and looked at something behind him. James looked up and staring down at
403 him was the ugliest face he had seen in at least three days. Nearby were the second, third, and fourth ugliest faces.
404 With the faces went large, filthy, muscular bodies and he could tell from their expressions that mean dispositions
405 were included at no extra cost.
406    "Well, what have we here?" rumbled the ugliest one. With his words came a foul wave of stale liquer breath that
407 would have driven a leser man to blowing his groceries. "Since when do they allow brats in here? You punks should be
408 home in bed. Bad things could happen to you this time of night."
409    One of the drunks stood over by Tariya. She looked down at the table, trying to ignore him. "Here's a comely one."
410 He said, lifting her face up. She jerked away, making him laugh. "Spirited, too. Bet she's never even been touched."
411 (That wasn't exactly what he said, but this IS a family board.)
412    "'til now." said another drunk. She looked at James, scared. He only looked back and shrugged mildly. It was just
413 talk.
414    It went past talk as the drunk grabbed her arm and picked her up roughly. She screamed and hit him in th chest but
415 might as well been punching the wall. "Leggo, dammit! Help! James!"
416    All eyes were on the young man, who continued to sit placidly. The drunk standing behind him placed both hands on
417 his shoulders and put most of his two hundred-odd pounds behind them. He looked down into the young man's eyes. "Now
418 James here doesn't want any trouble, does he?"
419    James looked back up, as if distracted, "Hmm? Me? Trouble? Never! I don't want any trouble at all. Gives me
420 heartburn."
421    "That's a good lad." said the drunk almost kindly. "Tell you what. You stay right here, and we'll bring her back
422 when we're done." a purely evil grin spread across his face. "What's left of her."
423    Laughing, they carried the screaming and cursing Tariya out the front door. Nobody else in the place gave a thought
424 to interfering. Most of them stared at the young man, who seemed to be staring at nothing. The inkeeper came out of
425 hiding and went over to him. "Those bastards been terrorizing the place all week. There's been nobody around could
426 stop them." Getting no response, he yelled, "For God's sakes, they might KILL her! Aren't you going to do
427 anything?"
428    The young man took another sip from his beer and then looked at him. His expresion was unfathomable. He replied,
429 "She can take care of herself. She said so."

447     mail from the FunnyWell (try typing 'mail' and see what happens.  It's
448     new, so I don't know how to use it).  If you do get it going, give my
449     some specific questions, and maybe I can offer some pointers.  I've

457 To new writer (author of "the destroyer"):
458   Just a suggestion -- If you want a group of anti-social drunks, I suggest
459 you place the setting somewhere other than the inn.  Too many have worked
460 for too long to allow such types free rein for more than a few seconds 
461 (about long enough to determine their anti-social tendencies).  We've had
462 a truce for some time that has kept out too much high-tech violence from
463 the inn itself (we've had plenty in other locales, though).  Aside from the
464 problem of believability (the apprentice disposed of them without more than
465 a casual thought; if he hadn't, well, it's hard to say how many interesting
466 fates those four would have met, but many.  You don't really expect an inn
467 full of seasoned adventurers to leave a lady in distress, do you?) your
468 writing shows a lot of promise.  We've adopted a few conventions -- when you
469 write about events in the inn proper, you are inviting interaction from others.
470 If you want to be sole author on a story-line, you should set it elsewhere,
471 then others will keep out unless invited in.
472   As to the twits -- they are like any other vermin (mosquitos, ants, 
473 cockroaches, or fleas) that plague the world.  The blood they try to draw
474 is attention -- ignoring their infantile antics seems to be the best
475 repellent.  Some good comes of them; some gain maturity and grow into
476 valuable contributors and gain acceptance and respect.  The rest soon find
477 that there's not much damage they can do to BW and get bored.

480 piper & zeb:  i find it difficult to continue with the adventure in its
481 current direction.  you've intorduced a theory that is hard for me to deal 
482 with even though i understand it.  it is like a foreign language -- one may
483 know of it and listen with ease while they are still a novice and not in
484 complete control of it.  i shall ponder over the theory a while longer, 
485 and hope that i may carry on to the best of my comprehension.
486   oh, and another point of order.  i am to ignore the two words "and died",
487 am i not?  it placed me in a great dilema...  what was i to do?

491 Now wait a second Jim, I *thought* I lived here all of my life, but now some
492 new talent has hit the streets and I know not what to think. First we have
493 some self-proclaimed DESTROYER who sallies into the Inn, nary a resume' on
494 his person, and we are supposed to quiver in fright? Then four drunks
495 approach the Inn. Now where did these drunks come from? Down the street? Come
496 now, remember were we all are. The Inn. THE INN! There are no bars down
497 the street to get drunk in. There are no drinking wells to get blasted on.
498 And attacking a lady? Why there is more collective talent on the side of
499 gallantry in the Inn than any other place in the universe. These brave and
500 noble men and women are just going to sit scared and do nothing while four
501 drunks from nowhere kidnap with intent to rape a comely young woman? If I
502 have eyes do I not see? If I am cut do I not bleed? Breaks and Credit is in
503 order here, because the norm of the Inn, that elusive quantity that is so
504 hard to tie down has up and left during the last few days. I dare say I am
505 dismayed at the flagrant disregard for conventional interaction. There are
506 not many rules but those few rules that do exist should be respected and
507 obeyed. So the next time a young man comes in followed by four drunks and
508 the proverbial attractive young girl, think about the ramifications of the
509 story, and how it affects the other members of the BackWater Inn, and how
510 they might react. It is sad to see the bells of October raining long and
511 hard, but music to the ears is always more desireable than pain to the
512 eyes.

535 Milch: Funywell? You mean Honeybucket? Yes I have reams of paper from that...that...machine. Are they making you do 
536 punchcard work? I bet you didn't know that IBM just recently closed its last punhccard manufacturing plant. Anyway,
537 I should be able to help you out. Honeywell JCL is strange but it can be mastered. Besides, you should be used to
538 masochism, owning a commode and all :-). MCP...meet MHP (Mad Honeywell Programmer). Let me know where you can be
539 found downtown and I'll arrange a time to meet. Sorry to hear you didn't get an apartment, that drive twice a day must
540 be a real drag (not race, just drag). Send mail to nelsons too, the person on the other end can also give much needed

547 I can't see why soo many people are getting riled up at one/two stories. 
548 Shouting 'This is the INN!' and 'What's all this now?' during the rape scenes.
549 As far as the untrained eye can see the Inn as we used to know of is dead,
550 only memories that try to influence the weak are still heard.  The old do
551 wish they were young again, but seeing they can't the only thing they can
552 do is ridicule others, mainly the young.  What I'm saying is that all the
553 people of this place are just looking for something to fight over, they
554 just can't eccept people for what they are or what they can do, they have
555 to put standards up for them to meet and when they don't it gives good reason
556 to ridicule them.  Just be yourself, do your own thing and SHUT UP!

561 Boy oh  boy backwater is a fierce place. A few humor-filled pokes of fun at some too-long-for-the-screen writing,
562 some vicious attacks on the sacred settings of another's story... Too much, too soon... shouldn't it be one point and
563 stick with it, rather than many, and nothing accomplished?
564 If there be writings only on the INN, could this not be just an INN board? If not, perhaps there are too many people,
565 most, or perhaps just many, who aren't interested in such in the first place?
566 
567 Tell you what... I'd be REAL intrigued to hear what Mikey likes (I know... Mikey hates everything). But after all,
568 in this BWMS universe, is he not the owner, the manager, nay, the Creator? Is he not this world's GOD?
569 If so, perhaps a comment of INTENTION, no rules are wonderful, but for curiousity sake, has something gotten carried
570 away? Or has a good idea been poluted? Or are too many good ideas not working in such a small format?
571 
572 SYSOP, let's hear your opinion. What is your intention of this? Clear the board, and state your case.

578 And to the writer who is poking fun at everyone: I'm sure you mean no harm, but perhaps put your work in parentheses
579 or something... then it can be ignored if so desired, or laughed at if it strikes just right. But also, perhaps your 
580 point is well taken, that the stories can be too long and dreary, and sometimes meaningless. A smoother way to make
581 the point perhaps is needed, but it is understood nonetheless.
