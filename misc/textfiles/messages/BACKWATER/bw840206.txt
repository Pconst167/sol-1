52 ... as the inkeeper wandered by he heard the story teller mumble to
53     himself-- always in a hurry and only looking at the entirely
54     obvious ah! well the arugmentive were always thus
55   
56 
57      Nila soon arrived at the foot of the enchanted hills and
58      began to climb toward the crest. She spent a pleasant time
59      smelling the wild flowers, watching the meadow butterflies
60      as she climbed, and so it was late in the afternoon when she
61      reached the top. Now the ragged musician had said Truth was
62      concealed here and that meant she would have to look very
63      very carefully. But Nila, as has been said, was very wise
64      and to tell the truth she prided herself on her logical
65      mind. Just now her logic told her that the place where East
66      began was the very crest of the hill. From the palace
67      window that was the very exact farthest east there was.
68   
69      At the exact crest Nila's heart skipped with anticipation
70      for there was a natural fountain springing up of itself at
71      the very highest point. Around it had been created a tiny
72      exquisite grove of perfume trees. A perfect soft breeze
73      whispered along the hill-crest bringing the gurgling of the
74      fountain and the afternoon scent of full-blown flowers, and
75      mixed with these a distant humming, as of bees seeking nectar.
76   
77      Oh!, how fortunate, Nila thought. Just when I am so thirsty
78      and perhaps Truth is concealed in this very fountain as well.
79      How marvelously things work out in the natural course of events.
80      As she knelt by the fountain a golden glint caught her eye.
81      She saw that the flat stone where she knelt was set with tiny
82      letters of gold:
83                  THE TASTE OF THE WATER IS IN THE THIRST
84      It's from the song she thought, the taste is in the thirst.
85      Nila contemplated this but still seemed to her that it was
86      quite wrong headed. Everyone knew the taste of water was the
87      opposite of thirst. That's why they went together so nicely.
88      "And anyway", she said, "the taste of the water is in the
89       water and the thirst is in me." So saying she scooped up a
90      delicate handful of sparkling water and drank small sips,
91      like a cat. She savored each drop in her mouth, feeling
92      her thirst magically disappear and be replaced with pure
93      satisfaction and joy. When she was fully content she sat 
94      back on her heels and looked down again at the fountain's
95      golden motto. Suddenly she realized there was another line
96      below the first and it now read:
97                  THE TASTE OF THE WATER IS IN THE THIRST
98                  AND SATISFACTION IN THE VANISHING OF DESIRE.
99      "Well", she said, "that at least makes sense. What makes me
100      happy is when my thirst goes away. Perhaps if this is the
101      fountain of Truth I shall never be thirsty again."
102   
103      By now the sun was setting, far to the West, beyond the
104      city, beyond the palace and her special garden, beyond
105      everything. She watched the sunset play of light on the
106      clouds perfectly content. Just before full dark, she lay
107      down to sleep in the perfumed garden, her coverlet of birds 
108      feathers almost floating above her body. The night breeze
109      was as soft as her own skin and the stars above twinkled
110      like the ragged musician's eyes. Nila always had everything
111      that she needed.

118 Glancing into the common room, the piper saw that the religious 
119 discussion had simmered down.  No bodies lay on the floor, and the
120 various combatants had subsided in general disagreement.  He entered
121 and asked the innkeeper for a mug of ale.
122 
123 "Where is the bard?" he asked the innkeeper.  "I would like to continue
124 our discussion of the previous evening, but my memory seems to be
125 rather erratic.  I would like to know of what we were speaking."

128      Sponge-bats from the polyp world floated all around, thier finely
129 tuned senses trained on the scene, thier incredibly photographic
130 memories soaking up information.
131      The Wiz genstured for my help, and I spent the next fifteen
132 minutes gently peeling the Ekks off of his equipment.  Curious little
133 beggars.  I pulled one patch of them almost five centimeters across off
134 the Wiz's shoulder, where they had moved for a better view.  They must
135 have been a thousand of the little fellows in the group, flashing excitedly.
136 Crowd control, indeed.
137      They finally got themselves under control, and I sat back (carefully!)
138 as the translators began thier chatter and the Wiz began to sight through
139 some instrument a the Dog moon, just rising.  He shouted something that
140 my trans unit couldn't handle and pointed both arms straight out at
141 the moon, gesticulating as his toe deftly hit the start switch.
142      He explained that the object of the demonstration was to pull
143 the moon down to just above ground level, put a marker on the rock, then
144 put it back, and I'll be two-legged if the moon wasn't getting larger
145 all the time it was rising!  Ain't technology wonderful?
146      The moon was up a full quarter now, and dominating the sky.  The
147 Wiz checked his instruments rubbing his hands together with glee, and
148 then reached for his can of spray paint.   He could hardly wait.  
149 Suddenly all the lights on his sighting instrument went deep purple
150 and alarms began to wail.  He jumped quickly and slapped the abort
151 switches as he headed at full tilt away from the area.  My trans
152 unit chatered something about UNSTABLE! as the form quickly retreated.
153   The general consensus of being seemed to be inclined to follow his
154 lead, but as the moon retreated, all hell broke loose...

157      Alonzo was feeling the liquor a bit, as he leaned on Serena
158 leaving the cafe.  A few steps from the door, that feeling he always
159 had when trouble was around crawled up his spine and curled itself
160 comfortable around the base of his neck, making the hairs seem to
161 stand on end.  "Oh, shit." he whispered, "Duck!"  
162      As he threw himself and Serena to the ground by the protection
163 of a heavy truck, he caught a glimpse of a flash from the alley
164 across the street as the rocket laucher coughed once.  Almost instantly,
165 the tiny cafe erupted into flame.  Serena was up and firing into the
166 alley almost as fast.  "I think he got away.  You stay here." she
167 ran into the alley.
168      She came out dragging a limp body.  Salizar quickly ran across
169 the street.  The first thing he noticed was the note stuck to the 
170 body with the knife that had killed him.  He pulled out the knife, and
171 tried to read the blood-soaked knife.
172      "Good stationery" he commented.  "It says, 'He was following
173 Serena.  The Inspector is still safe, but only alone.  McKane has
174 crossed my path for the last time.  See you in India.  Contremon.'"
175 They hurried away as the sounds of sirens began in the distance.
176 "Tell me everything you know, quickly!"

192  Considering the current trend in semiconducter memory
193 prices (ie. down), I have decided to offer my acclaimed
194 64k dynamic RAM chips at a reduction from their current
195 $5/chip to the incredibly low (am i beginning to sound like
196 Lane?) price of *****   $4   ***** a chip!
197   These are prime, new 4164-15's, with many success stories
198 accredited to them. Many, many computers use these chips......
199 but the prominent one that comes to mind is the Apple III.
200 Expansion by 64k bytes requires 8 chips, or 8*4=$32 for the
201 expansion!
202   Radio Shack, Commodore, Atari......all use these chips...
203 ..though a bit slower version. Please feel free to contact me
204 with any specific application questions.

223      Late in the afternoon as Tarn was walking along the side 
224 of the road, he heard the sound of running feet behind him.
225 Turning around he sees Emer aproaching at a high rate of speed.
226 Soon she is in front of him trying to catch her breath. Half
227 approaching towards her, he stops short a questioning look in
228 his eyes, his hand partially outstreached. he stands like a
229 statue frozen to inaction by his internal turmoil. He tries to
230 speak, but is unable to. Finnaly it becomes to much for him and
231 he begins to shake, and a wispered quiry escapes him "E.. Emer?.."

279 Scene:  Dockside -- Galata, Turkey
280 
281      The tramp steamer sat low in the water.  The name "Discovery" was barely
282 visible through the rust and accumulated grime.  Sweaty bare-chested men
283 toiled to get her laded before the scheduled departure time.  A tall man
284 dressed in khaki and a beautiful woman were locked in a farewell embrace on
285 the pier.  Behind a stack of crates, four men in saffron robes lurked, watching.
286      The embrace broke--Salazar gazed deep into Serena's eyes; "Well,
287 sweetheart, I don't suppose you'll reconsider and come with me to Calcutta?"
288      Serena sighed; "No, my dear, I have business to take care of first.
289 Don't worry, I'll be in the West Bengal within several days."
290      They embraced again and then the Inspector turned and boarded his ship.
291 Serena headed down an alleyway intent on reaching Istanbul.  The watchers
292 seperated... Two boarding the ship and the others stealthily following
293 Serena.
294      As Serena walked down the alleyway, she was overcome by a cold gnawing
295 in her gut.  Turning she spyed the bald-headed men... Turning again she saw
296 her path blocked by two more.  They stalked her like cats from the dark
297 jungle.  As they started to take their prey, a dark figure moved as if a
298 blur from the shadows.  Two of the robed men went down immediately from his
299 dagger.  Instantly, Serena's blade was in her hand and the other Krishnas
300 laid on the asphalt -- a death rattle on their lips.
301      Serena melted into Wassir's arms.  Softly she said, "Mohammed, you're
302 always there... even when I treat you badly."
303      Wassir smiled; "For an Albanian, love is all that is important." They
304 kissed quickly and headed on their way.
305      Unaware of Serena's struggle, the Inspector laid on the bunk in his cabin,
306 musing on many things.  Of his life as a policeman and his younger days.
307 Of an idealism almost totally lost to the vagaries of a cruel society. 
308 Idealism tarnished by a growing cynacism.  Of frustration, pain, and stress...
309 Of the loneliness that is a policeman's lot.  Of future plans... to continue
310 his course and face the everyday dangers of his job or perhaps journey
311 elsewhere and face the uncertaincy of a new challenge.  He also thought of
312 those who frequent the Inn and those who seem to have disappeared lately.
313 He wondered idly in Pam had gotten his message...
314      Outside his cabin the men in saffron listened intently at the door...
315 Long knives tightly held in their hands.  One grasped the knob and turned--
316 slowly opening the door...

328 Reeling slightly, the drunken poet made his way to the Inn. As he pushed 
329 open the well-used doors, he was suddenly knocked from his feet by the 
330 concussion of a portable anti-tank weapon. He cautiosly crawled, inchworm-
331 fashion to his accustomed seat at the back of the room. Signalling the 
332 Innkeeper for an ale from a s(hopefully) safe position beneath his table,
333 he reflected on his current position.
334 "Oh, well," he thought, "I suppose this's what I get for frequenting a 
335 trans-reality tavern."
336 The Innkeeper arrived with his usual seven ales and the poet handed up his
337 payment, quickly retreating with the precious fluids to his floor-level 
338 haven, peeking between the table legs to see if any more pyrotechnics were
339 forthcoming.
340 "ASlow night," the Innkeeper commented, as he watched a round of tracer 
341 bullets disappear out the doorway, narrowly missing his new rowan tree.
342 "But somehow I'm never bored here," replied the poet, sipping from his first
343 mug. He considered doubling his order; it looked like a long night ahead.

345 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
346 The piper was fussing with his pipes again.  He had the bass drone pulled 
347 out of the bag and the long tubular reed pulled out of the drone base.  
348 Carefully he pulled the tounge of the reed outward and slipped a hair under
349 it.  Placing it in his mouth, he blew and a racous "squeee" resulted.  He 
350 examined the reed closely, adjusted the position of a twist of yellow thread
351 around its base, then forced it into the base of the bass drone.  He held the
352 drone to his mouth and blew a deep "throoon" listening intently.
353    The gossamer veil of reality wavered and blurred -- echoes of gunfire 
354 resounded until he let off the note.  The piper smiled, he'd pass that one
355 up.  Pipes were just too difficult to keep inflated when you had to contend
356 with bullet holes in the bag.

360 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
361 YES, MAN IN GREY, I AM STILL AROUND, BUT MY SCHEDULE CAUGHT UP TO ME, AND
362 I'VE BEEN PLAYING CATCH-UP THE LAST COUPLA' DAYS.
363 LEONARD: HERE'S THE INFO YOU REQUESTED. SOMETIME AFTEWR THE EXILE TO 
364 BABYLON THE JEWS  ADOPTED TO SOME EXTENT THE PRACTICE OF USEING THEIR
365 ALPHEBETICAL LETTERS AS SYMBOLS OF NUMERICAL FIGURES. HOWEVER THIS USAGE
366 DOES NOT APPEAR EVEN IN POST-EXILIC HEBREW BIBLE MANUSCRIPTS. SEE FOR EX-
367 AMPLES, 'A'LETH; BEHTH; DALETH.
368 IN HEBREW NUMBERS ABOVE 10 ARE COMBINATION OF WORDS, REMINISCENT OF THE
369 WAY A CHILD FIRST LEARNS TO PUT LARGE NUMBERS TOGETHER.SUCH AS TWELVE IS
370 TEN AND TWO. EXCEPT THAT TWENTY IS THE PLURAL OF TEN, AND THIRTY A PLURAL
371 OF THE THREE, FORTY A PLURAL DERIVED FROM FOUR, AND SO ON. ONE HUNDRED
372 IS A SEPARATE WORD; TWO HUNDRED IS THE DUAL FORM. OTHER "HUNDREDS" ARE
373 COMPOSED OF TWO WORDS SIMILAR TO , FOR EXAMPLE THREE HUNDRED. THE HIGH-
374 EST NUMBER EXPRESSED BY ONE HEBREW WORD IS TWENTY-THOUSAND, THE DUAL 
375 FORM OF TEN THOUSAND. (MYRIAD) LARGER NUMBERS ARE COMBINATIONS OF WORDS
376 FOR EXAMPLE, AT 1 CHRONICLES 5:18 THE NUMBER 44,760 IS, LITERALLY TRAN-
377 SLATED FORTY AND FOUR THOUSAND, SEVEN HUNDREDS AND SIXTY. A MILLION IS 
378 WRITTEN AS A THOUSAND THOUSANDS. 2 CHRONICLES 14:9. REBEKAH'S FAMILY
379 BLESSED HER, SAYING: "OH, YOU ARE SISTER, MAY YOU BECOME THOUSANDS TIMES
380 TEN THOUSAND [LITERALLY, "THOUSANDS OF MYRIADS"]." GENESIS 24: 55, 60.
381 HOPE THIS EXPLAINS THEIR NUMBERS TO YOU A LITTLE BETTER, IT SEEMS YOU
382 HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF HOW IT WORKED ALREADY.
383 MAN IN GREY: ANY IDEAS ON A NEW TOPIC?

389 The dying rays of a blood-red sun shone bright on a scene from hell:
390 The broken harness and scattered dead of a battle grim and fell.
391 
392 In a forest glade two figures stood, their countenances proud.
393 One was a sorceress of ill will; the other was a man of God.
394 
395 The man of God cried to his foe, "Surrender while you may!
396 You shall not flee, for by my faith, my sword will bar your way."

398 Said the sorceress in a voice of ice, "You bleed from a dozen wounds,
399 And it takes no skill of mine to see you'll be a dead man soon."
400 
401 She raised her hands in a burst of fire. The lightnings crashed and groaned.
402 The priest stood still and from him flared a magic of his own.
403 
404 The two stood locked in a war of will, of sorcery and power,
405 Till the man of God felt his blood run cold -- he would not live the hour.
406 
407 The sorceress' laugh rang loud and shrill. "Now, priest, prepare to die!"
408 But a grim smile played on his ashen lips, for he'd one spell left to try.
409 
410 His father's sword he lifted high. He prayed and made his cast,
411 Then bowed his head to the bloody field and breathed his earthly last.
412 
413 The sorceress stood in the darkened glade and never said a word,
414 And the searchers found her clay-cold corpse transfixed by the dead man's sword!

416 	As the bard finished, he sat down near the piper. "Actually, my friend,
417 I don't remember either." He started to shake his head and stopped, as a pained
418 look crossed his face. "I've GOT to start singing more and drinking less." he 
419 muttered.

427      In all, there were only four meteorites, chunks broken off of
428 the moon.  They were not too large, but they made good sized craters
429 as they hit and the last one caught the EKKs administration building
430 square in the middle and crunched it and not a small number of officials
431 into REALLY unrecognizable blobs.
432      We of course booked the Wiz, but the scurrying about had broken
433 my translator and I had to go over the criminal code books by hand.
434 I'm always amazed by this Terran law, always having a law for every
435 possible occurrance!  I was just settling down to a good long
436 psxxt in private when the phone chimed in again.  Why does it always
437 have to happen just when you're wallowed in the sand pit?  It was
438 Mallory again, what a pain.
439      This time he had his screen on.  I can tell by the way he flinches.
440 He was much pinker than usual about the face.  I congratulated him on his
441 health, and he must have been pleased.  His face got even redder.
442      "Greeshnakh, of all the pig headed, slimy backed nincompoops that
443 ever..."  He wailed on.  Even without the translator I managed to catch
444 the usual compliments and amenities quite fluently, missing only a
445 couple of flowery adjectives.  He finally got to the point.
446      "...after all that Wiz did, you booked him for THIS?" Malone
447 tapped the indictment crystal against his palm.
448      I opened the four of my eyes which see into the ultraviolet
449 to read the crystal.  "Certainly Captain.  Having studied the
450 regulations completely, I decided that those charges most correctly
451 fit the crime."  All nine eyes blinked once in puzzlement.
452      Malone was very pleased.  He turned red as a Qnnf.  "Are you
453 kidding?" (I wouldn't be for another six months, but he couldn't
454 have seen the signs yet.)  he roared, "FAILURE TO FILE AN ENVIRONMENTAL
455 IMPACT STATEMENT AND DESTROYING THE EKK COLLEGE E?"

462      The two saffron-robed figures stopped before the door, pulling
463 it closed once again.  A tall man in an expensive ice-cream white suit
464 had rounded the corner of the deck.  They looked at each other and
465 began to dance..."Hari, Hari..."  The tall figure stopped for amoment,
466 as they were blocking the narrow passageway.  As he neared, the stopped,
467 and brandishing flowers, went into their pitch.  Contremon stopped,
468 and smiling, reached into his coat for his billfold, the Krishnas suddenly
469 enraptured by the thought of contributions.
470      Inside, the inspector heard the two muffled coughs, and the sound
471 of several splashes.  No one saw the two red and saffron robed figures
472 as they slowly floated out of sight...

481 probably the best fishing time is when the ocean tides are restless before
482 their turn and in the first hour of ebbing. All fish in all waters 
483 salt or fresh feed most heavily then.
484 Best temperatures for fish species vary widely, of course, and 
485 chiefly important if you are going to have your own fish pond.
486 Best temperatures for brook trout are 45 degrees to 65 degrees
487 Brown trout and rainbows are more tolerant of highter temperatures
488 Smallmouth black bass do best in cool water. Horned pout take 
489 what they find.

549 ALLRIGHT EVERYBODY, HERE COMES ANOTHER TOPIC:  I MUST ASK PEOPLE FOR AS
550 LITTLE PLAGARISM AS POSSIBLE. HERE WE GO!!!!!
551 
552 
553  T I M E    T R A V E L ! !
554 
555 
556 SPECIFICALLY, THE PARADOXES CONCERNED WITH THE USE OF IT.
557 NEVER MIND HOW, JUST WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU COULD?
558 FOR THE OLDEST PROBLEM(KILLING YOUR GRANDFATHER) HERE IS MY SOLUTION.
559 NO MATTER HOW YOU TRY, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO.  POISONINGS WILL FAIL, A GUN
560 WILL JAM, AN EXPLOSIVE GO OFF AT THE WRONG TIME, ETC.
561 A FACTOR I WILL CALL "TIME ENTROPY" COMES INTO PLAY HERE.
562 TIME WILL RESIST SIGNIFIGANT CHANGES, BUT MINOR ONES WILL BE ALLOWED.
563 EXAMPLE:  YOU GO INTO A CAFE AND BUY A CUP OF COFFEE. IF THE RESULT OF THIS
564 IS THAT THE COOK THROWS OUT A LITTLE LESS COFFEE THAT NIGHT, ALL IS WELL.
565 IF HOWEVER, THAT USED CUP WOULD CAUSE THE COOK TO RUN OUT OF COFFEE, IT
566 WOULD REQUIRE AN EXTREME EFFORT OF WILL TO BUY THAT CUP. IF YOU BUYING THAT
567 CUP WOULD RESULT IN THE COOK GOING OUT TO BUY SOME COFFEE AND GETTING RUN
568 OVER IN THE PROCESS, YOU WILL NOT BUY THAT CUP OF COFFEE. YOU WILL GO TO
569 ANOTHER CAFE, OR BE PREVENTED FROM GOSING THERE.
570 SUCH IS MY THEORY.
571 I REALISE THIS AREA IS LACKING IN FACTS, BUT THAT IS NOT A DISADVANTAGE.
572 AN INTELLEGENT PERSON WILL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH AN ARGUEMENT.
573 THIS LOGIC EXERCISE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAT QUOTING AN ENCYCLOPEDIA.
574 (NO OFFENSE MENT TO THE PREVIOUS DEBATE, IT SHOWS EXELLENT TALENT).
575 
576 I AWAIT YOUR REPLIES!!!!!

591 time travel? i assume are worried about cause and effect. Why? We have n
592 no evidence time is linear or continuous, if not there is no conflict.
593 A simple paradox creates a "time loop" that closes itself off from the
594 rest of time and therefore is undetectable. 'black hole effect'.
595 No problem.

606 After numerous injurys to his body,a mysterious person dressed entirely in gray
607 limps slowly into the inn.looking around he sees hari krishnas and a piper and
608 several other strange people."home! at last ive found home!" and he collapses to the floor in 
609 pain.the innkeeper saunters over to the poor man and requests his order.
610 "3 ales and some canadian 222's please".after limping to a vacent table the Man in Gray 
611 lks around once again and sees a man standing on a table shouting "who do you think will win the 1984 election?" 
612 and realises that all is good with the world,except of course the lady aiming a
