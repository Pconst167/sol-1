33 I am no fan of people who wait beside the road for an old
34 man to drive by in one of his 15 Rolls Royces. But the Attorney
35 General seems to have taken a position that is contrary to
36 history. He has filed a legal action claiming that Rajneeshpuran
37 (if that's how it's spelled) is not a legitimate city because it
38 was formed specifically to provide a haven for a religion.
39 Weren't all of the original Atlantic coast settlements in this
40 country formed for that reason; doesn't Philadelphia have a
41 "religious" background; and what about Salt Lake City?
42 
43 Things done in the name of law have often represented
44 attempts to avoid change; or,worse, they have presented the
45 guise of a sanitized version of plain old nasty prejudice.
46 
47 Law itself is neutral. Those who would use it for power rather
48 than for protection are abusing the privileges of all of us.
49 Come on, Mr. Frohnmeyer, show a little enlightenment.

53 TO POPS: ALL VERY WELL, OF COURSE, BUT THE PEOPLE DOWN THERE DID GET 
54 TOGETHER IN A VOTING BLOCK TO CRUSH THE INTERESTS OF THE MINORITY (ORIGINAL)
55 MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, EVEN UNDER THE OLD POLITICAL SYSTEM. IT IS EASY TO
56 PROJECT THAT NO-ONE NOT OF THEIR FAITH WOULD HAVE A CHANCE DOWN THERE.
57 AS FOR SALT LAKE CITY AND NEW ENGLAND, CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE THAT MINORITY
58 RIGHTS ARE SHOWING A BIT OF PROGRESS THERE.
59    FROHNMEYER IS NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE THEIR PRESENCE AS A COMMUNE. WHAT
60 WILL HAPPEN IF THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS A GOVERNMENT, THOUGH, IS THAT THE
61 REST OF US WILL HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR WELFARE THROUGH REVENUE SHARING.
62 THAT I OPPOSE AS WELL AS WANTING ANY LEGALLY RECONIZED CITY TO OBEY THE 
63 RULES FOR PROTECTION OF MINORITY RIGHTS.

65 DOES ANYONE KNOW WHATS HAPPENED TO DOM? I'M A BIT WORRIED ABOUT HIM
66 DROPPING OUT SO SUDDENLY AFTER BEING SO ACTIVE FOR SO LONG.
67 
68 OK, SO HOW ABOUT A PARTY WHERE WE ARE NOT SO ANONYMOUS? OR AM I WAY OFF 
69 BASE? IF SO, HOW CAN THIS 'BIT BUCKET' HAVE PARTIES. (WHERE AND WHEN AND
70 WHATS THE BIT BUCKETS NUMBER)?

87   The comparison between Salt Lake City and 'Neeshiepuram is not quite
88 right. After all, if a non-Mormon moves to Salt Lake City, he can own 
89 property in the city, run a business, and travel on the roads. This
90 can't be said for Bhagwan's haven. The New Jersey Supreme court has ruled
91 against it (I don't remember exactly what the ruling stated) by saying 
92 public funds can't be spent to support private concerns, as is done in
93 Rajneshpuram.

145 
146      AARON, THANKS, I'LL CHECK OUT CBBS TO GET THE INFORMATION.
147 
148      POPS, YOU'RE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FROHNMAYER RULING IS NOT QUITE
149 CORRECT.  AS CAPTAIN AMERICA SAID (THANKS FOR JOGGING MY MEMORY, CAP, 
150 YOU FORCED ME TO REMEMBER WHERE I SAW THE NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT RULING)
151 THERE IS A DISTINCT PROBLEM WITH THE DEFINITION OF A CITY AS RELATED TO
152 RAJNEESHPURAM.  YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT ALL PROPERTY IN THE "CITY" IS
153 OWNED BY A CORPORATION THAT IS OWNED ITSELF BY A RELIGIOUS FOUNDATION.
154 THE CORPORATION LEASES THE PROPERTY TO THE COMMUNE (INCLUDING ALL STREETS)
155 WHICH THEN ALLOWS THE PRESENCE OF TEMPORARY GUESTS ONLY.  IF YOU WANT TO
156 STAY OR SET UP A BUSINESS, YOU MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE RELIGION.  THE
157 COMMUNE, BY VIRTUE OF IT'S MAJORITY STATUS, EXERCISES ALL LOCAL GOVERN-
158 MENT POWER, INCLUDING LOCAL TAXATION.  THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT
159 HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY, WHERE THE METHODIST CHURCH GAINED POWER OVER 
160 ALL MUNICIPAL POWER IN THE COMMUNITY OF OCEAN GROVE.  THE COURT RULED AS
161 FOLLOWS (FROM AN ARTICLE BY HENRY KANE, FORMER OREGON ASSISTANT ATTORNY
162 GENERAL):
163 
164      " 'GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION ARE SO INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED AS TO BE
165 INSEPARABLE FROM ONE ANOTHER.  SUCH A FUSION OF SECULAR AND ECCLESIASTICAL
166 POWER NOT ONLY VIOLATES BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT,
167 IT ALSO RUNS AFOUL OF THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE OF OUR OWN STATE CONSTI-
168 TUTION.' "
169      "HABER'S ARTICLE INDICATES AGREEMENT WITH 5 1/2 OF FROHNMAYER'S SIX
170 CRITERIA:
171      1. A CITY MAY NOT PREVENT OR LIMIT TRAVEL BY NON-RESIDENTS OF THE
172 CITY ON COUNTY ROADS WITHIN THE CITY'S CORPORATE LIMITS.
173      2. A CITY MAY REGULATE AND RESTRICT, BUT MAY NOT PREVENT, TRAVEL
174 WITHIN A CITY BY NON-RESIDENTS.
175      3. A CITY MAY CLOSE TO GENERAL PUBLIC USE ROADS OWNED BY A CORPORATION
176 AND OPEN ONLY TO CITY RESIDENTS AND CORPORATION INVITEES.
177      4. A CITY MAY NOT USE STATE TAX FUNDS ON PRIVATE ROADS CLOSED TO 
178 GENERAL USE.
179      5. A HOTEL OR OTHER ACCOMMODATION WITHIN A CITY MUST COMPLY WITH THE
180 OREGON PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS LAW.
181      6. A CITY MAY RECEIVE AND SPEND PUBLIC FUNDS ONLY FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES."
182 
183      "RAJNEESHPURAM CAN MAKE THE OPINION MOOT BY (1) DEDICATING PUBLIC
184 STREETS, (2) DROPPING RESTRICTIONS ON VISITORS AND (3) ALLOWING NON-
185 ADHERANTS TO OWN PROPERTY, RESIDE AND DO BUSINESS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION."
186 
187      (FROM AN EDITORIAL PUBLISHED IN THE TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1983
188 OREGONIAN)
189 
190      I DON'T PERSONALLY CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHAT HAPPENS *IF* THE
191 CITY FOLLOWS THE RULES.  IT WOULD BE A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT IF RAJNEESHPURAM
192 IS ALLOWED TO DO AS THEY WISH, REGARDLESS OF THE LAW.
193

259 PREVIOUSLY, AND I AGREE WITH YOU IN ITS PURPOSE, BUT I STILL DON'T SEE A
260 VALUE IN KILLING OFF PEOPLE IN MASS QUANTITIES. PARTICULARLY CIVILIANS.
261 TYPICALLY WAR IS FOUGHT FOR IMPERIALISTIC REASONS, AND IF YOU KILL OFF 
262 ALL THE PEOPLE THEN IT IS REALLY A HOLLOW VICTORY. "THE OPERATION WAS A
263 SUCCESS, BUT THE PATIENT DIED!". AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY, YOU HAVEN' GAINED
264 ANYTHING UNLESS YOUR PURPOSE WAS TO SIMPLY KILL OFF ALL THE PEOPLE, AND
265 THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T MUCH OF A PURPOSE IN MY VIEW POINT.

280   a proposal:
281      pick a location (say, the gardens above OMSI), a time (next weekend,
282 noon?), and all intrested BWMS users could show up for a picnic lunch. If
283 anonymity is important, we could arange things accordingly (we all could
284 promise to be within 100 yd of a certain location, and those of us who
285 would be interested in meeting the others could "accidently" bump into
286 someone having a picnic and say "are you, by any chance, a BWMS user? if

289 Mikey:
290 From my viewpoint, I agree about the usefulness of war.  However if we 
291 look at war from the viewpoint of our (alleged) leaders, with their
292 (assumed of course) motivations, the possibility of some sort of war becomes
293 much more probable.  I can work all sorts of scenarios out in my head that
294 get us into everything from a full-blown thermonuclear exchange to island
295 hopping in the caribbean -- whoops, that end is dated -- jungle jumping
296 in central america.  I was active during the 60's anti-war movements.  
297 Somehow the exitement faded as my hair did.  Now about all that is left is
298 a lot of grey and a massive distrust of professional politicians.  (I feel
299 that at this time when a person has climbed the political ladder to the
300 point where he can be considered for office by the party he is so compromise
301 that he is unfit for the job.)  The disadvantage of our present system
302 is that we allow power in the hands of those who activley seek it.  
303 UnfSince many who seek power are unfit (from my point of view, of course)
304 to hold power, and for the good of the rest of us should be held powerless,
305 we get corrupt, self-important persons capable of projecting images that
306 garner votes and incapable of meaningful leadership.  Unfortunately, I can't
307 think of a viable alternative.  If we could verify the character of the
308 candidate for office through some mechanical (and hopefully non-corruptible)
309 means, the incumbents would somehow use it to retain their strangle hold
310 on the taxpayer's pocket.  Sigh***

329 Pam -- thanks for the quotes from the Oregonian about
330 use of public funds for private roads. Hrothgar & Capt. America
331 raised a similar argument. Of course I can not recommend that
332 we should all contribute to the roads of a city that will not
333 let us travel on them, even though I contribute now to roads
334 all over the state and the nation that I never travel on.
335 But, you will say, that is a matter of choice, not some one
336 else's determination. Let us not forget that the choice is
337 limited to where I go -- I have never had any choice about
338 how my tax contributions were applied, even when they went to
339 uses that I 
340 thought were immoral, repressive or intended simply to enrich
341 the benefits of a powerful few.
342 
343 The point is not that we should ignore conditions at Rhajneeshpuram
344 that are contrary to what legitimate cities are supposed to
345 guarantee. Rather we should recognize that we regularly ignore
346 such things until our fears and prejudices encourage us to use them
347 as a cause for action.
348 
349 And Jody -- sorry about the extra space above my previous
350 message, but it was there before I started. I know because I 
351 tried to get above it a couple times. Don't be too quick to
352 accuse.

358      YES, POPS, WE ALL DO TEND TO DO THAT, AND IT OCCURS ALL TOO OFTEN.
359 BUT THOSE THAT WOULD EXCLUDE THE FOLLOWERS OF THE BHAGWAN WOULDN'T HAVE
360 A LEG TO STAND ON IF RAJNEESHPURAM WERE TO FOLLOW THE RULES, RATHER THAN
361 ATTEMPTING TO CIRCUMVENT THEM.  AND OREGON HAS A BETTER RECORD THAN MOST
362 IN MAKING ALL FOLLOW THE RULES, AS THE CONSTANT ATTEMPTS BY LARGE LAND
363 INTERESTS TO GET RID OF THE LCDC ATTEST.  THEY WOULD MUCH PREFER TO DO 
364 AS THEY WISH, RATHER THAN BE FORCED TO FOLLOW THE RULES.  AND IF THE 
365 FOLLOWERS OF THE BHAGWAN CAN DO IT THAT WAY, WHAT IS TO PREVENT SOME
366 CORPORATION WITH EVEN LARGER RESOURCES FROM DOING THE SAME THING, ONLY
367 ON A BIGGER SCALE?  AND I THINK THAT MANY WOULD BE MORE WILLING TO ACCEPT
368 THEM IF THEY HAD A LESS ABRASIVE REPRESENTATIVE THAN MA PREM SHELIA.  
369 ANYONE THAT ATTEMPTS TO MAKE A COMMENT THAT IS IN THE LEAST NEGATIVE
370 ABOUT THEM IS MET WITH STRIDENT ACCUSATIONS OF BIGOTRY AND PREJUDICE.  
371 AT THE SAME TIME, OREGONIANS MUST ADOPT A LESS HOSTILE TONE TOWARD THEM.
372 I THINK THAT A SOLUTION CAN BE REACHED, BUT THE RHETORIC MUST BE COOLER.
373 
374      NOTE THAT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN OREGON WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
375 IF THEY HAD ATTEMPTED IT SOMEWHERE ELSE, SAY IN TEXAS.  THANK GOODNESS

397 of regal pleasure....complete with concubines , planes and expense accounts
398  
399 And these "Elite" I have known display almost a locker-room mentality

416 How's that?
417 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Anon :::::::::::
418 WELL NOW!
419 LOOK HERE NOW: I SUSPECT THAT EVERYBODY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR ANONYMITY
420 WOULD FEEL MUCH BETTER IF THEY ALL REALIZED THAT NOBODY REMEMBERS MUCH OF
421 WHAT THEY HAVE SAID BEFORE THE LAST FEW DISKS. SAD, BUT HELPFUL IF YOU WANT
422 TO PARTY. FORGETFULNESS IS A SOCIAL LUBRICANT, WITHOUT A DOUBT. JUST TRY
423 BEING NICE FOR A FEW DAYS AND THE MEMORY OF ALL THOSE NASTY INSULTS WILL
424 JUST DIE AWAY. OR CLOSE ENOUGH. THE POSITIVENESS OF SUCH A MEET SHOULD OVER-
425 WHELM ANY SMALL BAD FEELINGS. AFTER ALL, HOW CAN WE RESENT REMARKS MADE
426 TO US UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF BWMS? I SEE ANON HAS BEEN FEELING POSITIVELY
427 SOCIAL LATELY. IF HE CAN DO IT........
428 
429 I THINK THE PICNIC IS PROBABLY GONNA BE A LITTLE WET. ALTERNATIVES? BUT THE
430 POTLUCK IDEA IS GOOD - - LONG AS THERE AREN'T ANY GLASS SLIVERS IN THE
431 FONDUE. LOOK WHO'S PARANOID NOW.
432 
433 SOME OF THE USERS MAY LIKE BWMS AS A FORUM BECAUSE IT GIVES THEM AN EQUALITY
434 OF EXPRESSION THEY MAY NOT NORMALLY HAVE. SOME YOUNGER PEOPLE, FOR INSTANCE,
435 MAY BE USED TO HAVING THEIR IDEAS DISCARDED UNFAIRLY THROUGH BIAS. THERE
436 ARE MANY OTHERS WHO MIGHT FEEL THE SAME.
437 
438 I FEEL THAT PROBABLY NEARLY ALL THE USERS OF THE SYSTEM ARE PROBABLY BROAD
439 MINDED ENOUGH TO OVERCOME SUCH PREDJUDICES. IF NOT, YOU CAN NEVER SEE THEM
440 AGAIN AND GET EVEN LATER ON BWMS. SOME OF US ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE LESS
441 MONSTROUS IN OUR MODE OF EXPRESSION IN PERSON - OR WE WOULDN'T HAVE LIVED
442 SO LONG.
443 
444 THE QUESTION THAT BOTHERS ME THOUGH, IS COULD I GO BACK TO BE MOUNSTROUS
445 AGAIN? ONCE I KNEW ALL OF YOU?
446 
447 EVERY SILVER LINING MUST HAVE A CLOUD.
448 
449 SUGGESTION #1: HAVE PARTY WITHIN PRACTICAL REACH OF BUS SYSTEM.
450 SUGGESTION #2: IF NOT POT-LUCK, HOW ABOUT CHINESE FOOD? ALWAYS A CHEAP SOLU-
451 TION.
452 SUGGESTION #3: HOW ABOUT SOMEBODIES HOUSE? (DEPENDS ON HOW MANY COME?)
453 
454 ANYBODY HEARD OF A PARTY GAME CALLED CROSS? DON'T GIVE IT AWAY IF YOU HAVE!
455 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HROTHGAR, SOCIALITE OF THE NORTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
456 P.S. MOST OF US SEEM INTERESTED UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS. LIKE IF WE ALL
457 WEAR MASKS OR SOMETHING. CAN WE GET A COUNT OR A NAME LIST HERE?
458 SO FAR I THINK IT'S MIKEY, AARON, HROTHGAR,PAM, JODY, CYM, ANON - WHO ELSE
459 AND HAVE I WRONGLY INCLUDED ANYONE? D? DEB? BAD? ELBERITCH, DOM, DAVE, ...
460 CQ CQ CQ

471  Luke, I have not been on the system lately,sorry. So,you want to be my icecream
472 man? Its up to you. You haven't even seen me yet. How do you know you won't;
473 
474 think I am totaly repulsive? Maybe you should meet me first. THEN if you want...
475 ask me again if you can be my icecream man. The answer would probably be yes. It
476 just so happens to be..... I'm looking for an icecream man. I will be looking 
477 forward to your next message. I still don't know who you are. Or how to find you
478 if I had to. How about a physical description? Be lookin' forward to your
479 next message(as I already said I see).  You little dreamer....

487 GOT ME WORRIED. I HOPE HE COMES BACK.

498 Dearest Jody...
499      I know the restriction of talking by modem can be a little tough on a
500 friendship, so I guess we'll have to so something about it. I guess the
501 'small' difference in our age doesn't bother you? I wanted to get that out
502 front quick just in case you wanted to keep our conversations 'modem only.'
503 This whole thing is quite intruiging to me! Maybe we should try and meet at
504 CTC, and after that, if you never want to see me again, I will inderstand. As far as
505 never having seen you, sure what a person looks like is important to some, but
506 what is underneath is much more important to me. You know all the cliche's, 'beauty is only skin deep' etc...
507 What do you think? Shall we go ahead with this? Are you really interested, or just
508 toying with a poor guy's heart?
509 I will be awaiting your next message. (In a nutshell I am 6'3", 175 lbs, brown hair & eyes) hope this helps...
510 Bye

512 PS To party arrangers. I am all for a party too. What ever the majority decides, I'm sure I'll be able to go along with. If
513 someone who couldn't otherwise get there needs a ride, I might be able to offer transportation, and I would certainly be
514 willing to bring something if we do indeed decide to have a potluck. Anything for the people who must put up with messages 
515 from a lonely apprentice!

520  excuse a moment while a scrape the BUBBLEGUM from my backplane......
521 
522   Much better! well know, where are we? Oh yes..the party. Well, Mike,
523 I can offer spirited discussion of my plans for some new single-chip
524 CMOS processors, but thats about it. How does one go about enticing a
525 SYSOP? Money? Food? Sex?......I think food is it. If we have a potluck,
526 (an idea I disdain intensely), I vote that Mikey should be our guest. In
527 fact, if we order some non-swelling food, how 'bout we all chip in a buck
528 and buy Mike a dinner?
529 
530   Anyone been to ORYCON? I can't make it (broke!), so please keep me
531 updated on any happenings.
532 
533   A place (for the party) that is TRI-METable is a must. I would hope that
534 the environment would be relaxed, sedate, generally comfortable; I don't
535 know how it would work at someone's home, I think another environment 
536 would be a better idea.
537 
538 i can see it now...

546 See, I knew this would happen. I make a big deal about it to
547 Pops and it happens to me. 
548 Sorry Pops. I guess it was fate huh?
549  
550 Luke(or whatever you be called): I am willing to meet you at CTC. I have al-
551 ways believed that old cliche'. Its just hard to find someone else(male) who
552 believes it too. I wouldn't toy with your heart. As long as you wouldn't toy
553 with mine. Just how different is our age difference. 20 years? 7 years? 3 
554 years? Hmmmm, I wounder. Yes I am studying French. It is my second year. I 
555 would say something in French to you but I can't think of anything. Until 
556 your reply..............

562 I am willing to go to the BWMS party but I might be out of town. When are 
563 you planning to have it? Is there a set date? How about if we all went to a 
564 cheap resturant?

570 re:  Rashneeshies 
571   I do not think that we have to worry about a large corporation doing
572 what has been done to Antelope.  There is insufficient prejudice to allow
573 it to happen.  The red clan has only been able to get away with what they
574 have done because Oregonians hate the thought of appearring prejudice.
575 As a result, they allow someone to break the rules readily, to avoid
576 the label.  That is why the city of Antelope was usurped in violation
577 of the spirit of the Constitution.
578 
579 re: Party
580 I live on a busline, and I do have a reasonably sized house.  I would be
581 willing to allow its use on the condition that a) noone smoked tobacco
582 in the house (my spouse is allergic), and b) the house was not turned
583 into a federal disaster area (I hate filling out those forms).  I see
584 that at least one person is not in favor of a home, and I understand
585 the concerns, and share them, but I thought I would make the offer.

604      AARON, YOU HAVE MY UNDERSTANDING.  I'VE LEFT THIS MESSAGE AT THE
605 SAME TIME AS I LEFT LINES 469-494 ON DISK A, MOSTLY BECAUSE THE THOUGHT
606 OF ALL THIS WASTED, EMPTY SPACE TROUBLED ME.  WHY CAN'T DISK B BE USED
607 FULLY BEFORE DISK A REACHES LINE 500.  I HAD TO FINISH THE LAST DISK JUST
608 BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.  AS I HAVE
609 BEEN KEEPING A PRINTOUT OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS APPEARED HERE FOR SOME
610 TIME, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET EVERYTHING.  AND TO THE TWERPY NERD
611 THAT GAVE MIKEY SO MUCH GRIEF ABOUT THE RELEASE OF THE BW DISKS, I WANT
612 YOU TO KNOW THAT I HAVE IT ALL HERE!  YOU'LL BE GETTING THE RANSOM NOTE
613 SHORTLY.
614 
615      I'LL SAY IT HERE, SINCE SOME OF OUR NEWEST USERS OBVIOUSLY DON'T 
616 CHECK TO SEE IF DB IS FULL BEFORE USING DISK A (LIKE THE OLDER USERS ALL
617 SEEM TO DO).  I KNOW THAT IF I WANT THE NEWUSER TO READ MY RESPONSES, I
618 MUST PUT IT BELOW HIS/HER MESSAGE.  BUT HERE I CAN LAMENT THE DEATH OF
619 THE INN THAT I HAVE KNOWN, AND BE CERTAIN THAT NONE BUT THE OLD-TIMERS 
620 WILL READ IT.  AND SINCE DA IS ALMOST TO LINE 500 ALREADY, THIS WILL SOON
621 VANISH INTO MIKEY'S VAULT, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.  AARON, THE BUBBLEGUM
622 PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE AFFECTING ALL OF THE BBS'S, AND IS A DIRECT RESULT 
623 OF COMPUTERS AND MODEMS BEING CHEAP AND READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITH
624 LITTLE OR NO KNOWLEGE OF THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THEM.  I ONCE FELT I HAD
625 NO KNOWLEGE, BUT MY KNOWLEGE HAS GROWN RAPIDLY DUE TO MY DESIRE TO KNOW
626 WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LITTLE BEAST.  WE CAN JUST SAY THAT THE INFLUX OF
627 CHILDREN SHOWS THAT COMPUTERS ARE COMING OF AGE, USEABLE BY ALL.
