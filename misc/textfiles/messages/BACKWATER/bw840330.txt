21      Ahh...  the  sun feels good.  The grass is soft,  and the  gentle 
22 sonorous   rumble  of  the  brook  nearby...   It's  so  relaxing  and 
23 comfortable  I hardly want to get up...   Brook?!   Grass?!!   Sun?!!!  
24 Quickly I climb out of my sleeping bag and look around me.  The forest 
25 is gone,  and now I am in a bright sunny glade.   This leaves me  very 
26 confused.   I  don't  know what is going on.   Where am I?   What  has 
27 happened?!  
28      After  a  moment  I regain my composure and take a  look  around.  
29 Obviously  something  happened in the night,  but I don't  know  what.  
30 The camp fire is gone, but my equipment is still here.  Looking around 
31 further, I notice that the area I am standing in is surounded by a low 
32 wall,  and as was the clearing of last night it is shapped in the form 
33 of  a  pentagram though it is twice as big as the one in  the  forest. 
34 From the looks of the crumbling stone it would appear that it has been 
35 here  for a very long time.   I wonder what connection it  might  have 
36 with the one in the forest from last night?  
37      Well,  I  guess  I'll  have to make the best  of  the  situation.  
38 Putting my equipment back into my backpack, I shoulder it and stepping 
39 over  the  wall,  I decided to head north towards the brook as  I  was 
40 thirsty and could use some fresh water to sooth my parched throat.  
41      Within  a few moments I reached the brook.   Kneeling down at its 
42 bank I drink my fill of the wonderfully tasting water.   Never have  I 
43 tasted  such  water!   So pure and clean!   Never again could I  drink 
44 water and not remember this.   Getting back up I turn around to get my 
45 bearings, and stumble into a bush.
46      What's this?   It's a young rowan tree!  Could this mean that she 
47 has  been here?   Looking down I see an imprint of a bare foot in  the 
48 mud  heading  south.   Well,  I  guess that is as good  as  any  other 
49 direction to continue my search for PAM.

53 the slavers bucause they were supirior genetic engeneers.

66 to the people discussing Ptavvs, slavers, Bandersnatchii, etc.
67 Ptavvs ARE slavers (actually then proper term is thrintun 
68 <singlular is thrint>), they just don't have the power that a "normal" thrint
69 has.

90 Dear Mr. Wassir:
91 
92 I am writing because I know you are, once again, on good terms 
93 with the McKane organization. Quite frankly, with LeRoy out of 
94 town I have no where else to turn. I do so hope you can help. 
95 
96 Monsieur d'Autun is missing; I think he has been kidnapped.
97 
98 When I tried to contact him his phone was disconnected, his 
99 number given to a telephone switching company, and his office 
100 turned into a GTE telephone outlet. There has been no ransom 
101 note, so far anyway, but I am very worried.
102 
103 If you could see yourself clear to help me find Monsieur 
104 d'Autun, at least until Mr. McKane gets back, I'd be so   
105 thankful. If we could return Monsieur d'Autun I'm sure I 
106 could talk Mr. McKane into delivering the earmuffs he promised.

112 Mr. Penfield:
113 Since he chose to ignore our wishes, M. d'Autun has been "put on hold"
114 (so to speak). Perhaps the next time we request a meeting, your representative
115 will attend?
116 In the meantime we suggest that you not get involved with Wassir. He
117 seems to be having some troubles of his own. The Libyans wish to discuss 
118 the whereabouts of several nuclear devices with him. Somehow they seem to have 
119 gotten the idea that he had something to do with their diasappearance. A word to
120 the wise, eh?

201 Observing that the quest had run out of steam the piper raised his pipes to
202 his shoulder, inflated them, and begain the strains of "The Black Bear".  
203 The wizard's chambers grew silent as thesound filled the area.  Several figures
204 moved over near the piper and entered an area that seemed to quiver in the
205 air, as the air over a heated stove.  The piper segued into "Too Long In This
206 Condition" and the members of the group grew first translucent, then transparent
207 then faded out altogether.
208    The innkeeper was polishing the aged wooden bar, meditating on how peaceful
209 the inn had been of late, when he heard in the distance the sound of pipes.
210   "Oh no!" he groaned to no one in particular.  "Not that bunch back again.
211 Oh well, as Confucus say, when inevitable..." he began lining up mugs of ale
212 on the wooden counter top just as the group faded into view.  
213    The piper lifted his arm from the bag and snapped of the last notes of the
214 song.  Looking around, he saw the smiling face of the innkeeper behind a row
215 of filled glasses, those quickly falling to the onslaught of the returning
216 adventurers.  Wading into the fray, the piper retrieved a glass and sat back
217 at his old table.  As he looked about at his companions, he said, "You know
218 of course, that we have not suceeded.  We still are open to the importation
219 of advanced weapons into the inn.  Does anyone have a plan?"
220 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
221 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
222 NOT TO BREAK THE MOOD HERE OR ANYTHING BUT.......HERE'S SOME INFO. I
223 FOUND QUITE INTERESTING ON QUASARS AND PULSARS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AT
224 LEAST TEN MILLION ARE VISIBLE WITH A LARGE TELESCOPE. QUASARS THAT IS.
225 THEY ARE BELIEVED BY ALL BUT A FEW ASTRONOMERS TO BE AT VAST DISTANCES
226 FROM THE EARTH. LIKE 2 TO 15 BILLION LIGHT YEARS. JUST AROUND THE BLOCK
227 IN THE UNIVERSE.
228 DR. EDWARD R. HARRISON, AN ASTRONOMER AND PHYSICIST, DESCRIBES THEM THIS
229 WAY:" IMAGINE THAT A LARGE ROOM REPRESENTS THE GALAXY; ON THIS SCALE THE
230 HIGHLY LUMINOUS QUASAR IS NO MORE THAN A SPECK OF DUST FLOATING IN THE 
231 AIR." YET EACH OF THESE SPECKS OF DUST PUMPS OUT ON AN AVERAGE, A HUNDRED
232 TIMES MORE ENERGY THAN ALL THE BILLIONS OF STARS IN OUR GALAXY PUT TO-
233 GETHER! WHAT ARE THESE QUASARS?..........NO ON KNOWS, BUT THERE ARE
234 THEORIES. HERE'S AN INTRIGUING ONE. THE LIGHT FROM THE MOST DISTANT 
235 QUASAR TAKES 15 BILLION YEARS TO REACH US. THAT MEANS THAT WE SEE THEM
236 AS THEY WERE 15 BILLION YEARS AGO. NO KNOWN QUASAR IS MORE THAN 15 BIL-
237 LION LIGHT-YEARS AWAY; HENCE THEY REPRESENT SOMETHING THAT STARTED HAP-
238 PENING 15 BILLION YEARS AGO.
239 ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT POPULAR THEORY, THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS STARTED
240 WITH A 'BIG BANG' ABOUT 18 TO 20 BILLION YEARS AGO, THIS COULD MEAN THEY
241 CAME INTO EXISTANCE ABOUT THE TIME THE UNIVERSE WAS ONLY FROM 3 TO 5
242 BILLION YEARS AGO. ACCORDING TO THE THEORY, THAT IS ABOUT THE TIME WHEN
243 GALXIES STARTED TO FORM. HENCE, QUASARS MAY BE GALAXIES IN THE PROCESS
244 OF BEING BORN!.................AND THEN THE PULSARS.......IN 1967 ASTRON-
245 OMERS WERE STARTLED AGAIN WHEN THEY DISCOVERED AN OBJECT SO BIZARRE THAT
246 THEY THOUGHT IT WAS SOME EXTRATERRESTIAL INTELLIGENCE TRYING TO CONTACT
247 EARTH! IT WAS A RADIO SIGNAL THAT FLASHED ON AND OFF, PULSATING IN A 
248 REGULAR RHYTHM. THIS TIME THE SOURCES SEEMED TO BE STARS LOCATED WITHIN
249 THE GALAXY. THEY CAME TO BE CALLED PULSARS. TO EMIT THEIR DISTINCTIVE
250 SIGNALS THEY MUST BE ROTATING, RATHER LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE BEACON. AND 
251 SINCE THEY PULSATE EVERY SECOND OR SO (there is one that pulsates 30
252 times a second) THEY MUST BE VERY SMALL AND SPINNING LIKE A TOP. AS-
253 TRONOMERS NOW BELIEVE THAT PULSARS MAY BE ONLY 24 KILOMETERS ACROSS, BUT
254 SO DENSE THAT A CUBIC INCH WOULD WEIGH MILLIONS OF TONS. THEY ALSO FEEL
255 THAT THEY MUST BE VERY HOT AND HAVE A HUGE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD. STRANGE
256 OBJECTS INDEED!

265 The bard had been listening to a conversation started during the
266 trip back. It reminded him of a song....
267 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
268 Kzanol, Teela, and Friends (words: Jordin Kare, tune: Tie me kangaroo down)
269 Tie me bandersnatch down, Brown,
270 Tie me bandersnatch down;
271 All half-million pounds, Brown,
272 Tie me bandersnatch down.
273 
274 Ain't me tnuctipun fun, son,
275 Ain't me tnuctipun fun?
276 Just beware of their guns, son,
277 But ain't me tnuctipun fun?
278 
279 Treat me sunflowers right, mate,
280 Treat me sunflowers right;
281 And don't go out when it's light, mate,
282 Treat me sunflowers right.
283 
284 Me racing virpin are quick, Nick,
285 Me racing virpin are quick;
286 Their looks would make you feel sick, Nick,
287 Me racing virpin are quick.
288 
289 Turn me stasis field on, John,
290 Turn me stasis field on;
291 When it shuts off you'll be gone, John,
292 Turn me stasis field on.
293 
294 So we turned his field on, it's true, Lou,
295 There wasn't much we could do;
296 We'll leave the problem for you, Wu,
297 With a Thrint, what else could we do?
298 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
299 (note: the above is sung with a THICK Aussie accent - thus mate becomes "mite". 
300 The weight of a Bandersnatch is closer to .5 billion lbs! All references can be found in the works of Larry Niven)
301 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
302 While sipping his drink after the song, an idea came to the bard. 
303 "Of course! Why didn't I think of it before!", he exclaimed.
304 "Piper, apprentice, I think I've got it! All we have to do is get
305 ARDNEH to help!"
306 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
307 The apprentice looked startled, "Yes, but that is not what any man
308 would call an easy task milord!"

320 Dear Dufus;
321      Regarding your request to find the funny French guy, I would be glad
322 to assist.  It seems things are getting a little slow in the land of OZ.
323 We've created as much havoc here as is possible, so we might as well move
324 on to another adventure.  Now if only we can find our way back to the
325 Inn.  It seems when the brave adventurers left, we didn't.  The Wizard is
326 a sour old goat who is trying to get rid of us... 
327       A word of advice:  DON'T USE THE TELEPHONE or you'll end up like
328 d'Autun.  All further contacts should be either by bonded carrier pigeon
329 or via the Backwater.  Please forward all information to Serena.  We'll
330 pick it up when we get back to your reality... Now where did that paisley
331 door go?

344 DEAR GET IT: SINCE YOUR JOKE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON SOUTHERN PEOPLE IN 
345 GENERAL OR NOT TOLD AT ALL, BUT YOU WENT AHEAD AND MENTIONED BLACK
346 PEOPLE TWICE GRATUITOUSLY, I ASSUME THAT YOU WILL FAIL IN YOUR WISH NOT
347 TO OFFEND ANY BLACK PEOPLE, HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN YOUR LIFE.
348 THE REASON IS THAT THE JOKE DEPENDS FOR IT'S IMPACT ON AN UNFLATTERING
349 BLACK STEREOTYPE. JOKES ABOUT HUMAN FAILINGS IN THOUGHT, GRAMMER, OR DEED
350 ARE INDEED PERMISSABLE, BUT IN OUR PLURALISTIC SOCIETY IT IS BETTER NOT TO
351 IDENTIFY THE BUTT OF YOUR JOKE AS TO RACE, RELIGION, SEX, AGE OR ANYTHING
352 ELSE. THE ONLY TIME A SPECIFIC REFERENCE CAN BE IN GOOD TASTE IS WHEN 
353 ONE REFERS TO ONESELF, A WELL KNOWN PUBLIC FIGURE(SOMETIMES, USUALLY WHEN
354 THEY ARE A POLITICAL FIGURE), OR TO SOMEONE BEING CONFRONTED FACE TO FACE. A
355 GOOD GUIDELINE IS WHETHER YOU WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE TELLING THE SAME 
356 JOKE WITH THE PERSON IN QUESTION RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. IF YOU FELT COMFORT-
357 ABLE TELLING THIS JOKE WITH THE ELDERLY WOMAN RIGHT NEXT TO YOU, I'D SAY
358 YOU QUALIFIED AS A SOCIOPATH.

377 Bard, If I remember correctly (since I just looked it up, I'm sure I do!), 
378 ARDNEH and ORCUS destroyed each other.  Or were you considering 
379 requesting his/its help at some point in his/its time line prior to
380 his/its 'termination'?
381 While reading through the messages here, coming across the name ARDNEH
382 causes a severe reality shift of its own to me.  In a previous existence,
383 in a different reality, when I was involved in D&D, my main character,
384 a magic-user/thief, was named Ardneh.  My first reaction to your
385 'get Ardneh' suggestion was 'huh? How does he know about Ardneh? And
386 he's only a 5th level, hardly in the same class as even the apprentice!'
387 Then, of course, I realized who you were referring to.
388 Liked your last song.  Having just finished (re)reading the Ringworld
389 books, its particularly fresh in my mind.
390 Regarding OZ, I think the group left a little too soon.  TWOOz is
391 going to be on the boob this Friday.  Or is that why you left--it

395 CC: Interesting that your self righteous indignation is
396 aroused by a derogatory joke about a black person yet you 
397 see no harm in inflicting the same joke on a Southerner.
398 Perhaps you should examine your own prejudices before 
399 condemning those of others.  Max.

422 collection.
423 (in no particular order...) Cultosaurus Erectus, Mirrors, Some Enchanted
424 Evening, Extraterrestrial Live, Fire of Unknown Origin, Agents of Fortune,
425 On Your Feet or On Your Knees, Spectres...Embarrassingly, I can't remember the
426 name of their latest album, and I believe I am missing their first 3 or 4 albums

452      For  hours now I had been walking south through the grass  plain, 
453 and still no sight of anything to break the monotony of it.   What had 
454 started  out  to look like a pleasant grassy glenn has turned  into  a 
455 scortching  grass covered plain.   Even my hat I removed from my  pack 
456 does not keep out the heat.  It is sweltering! 
457      Finally  in the afternoon I can take no more and I sit down on  a 
458 rock  and  take out a small tent from my pack to try to  provide  some 
459 shade  to rest in.   Setting it up,  I go inside and lay down to rest.  
460 Soon I am fast asleep.
461      Later  on  I wake up to the chill night  air.   Going  outside  I 
462 decide  to  light a small fire to ward off the cold.   Getting out  my 
463 matches to strike a fire,  I am quite surprized when nothing  happens!  
464 Try  as  I  might,  I  cannot get them to strike!   Now  I  am  really 
465 confused.  What is wrong?  Then on an impulse I get out my lighter and 
466 try that.   It worked!   So,  it appears that matches do not work here 
467 wherever I am.  
468      Warming my hands over the fire,  I think about what I have gotten 
469 myself  into.   Why  did I ever let that Innkeeper talk me  into  this 
470 crazy quest to search for PAM.   Not only do I not know where I am,  I 
471 don't  even know how I got here,  or how to get back!   My only hope I 
472 have  is to find PAM and try to persuade her to show me the way  back, 
473 and I have almost no clues as to how to find her.  Oh Lord!  Why did I 
474 ever let him talk me into this?  No reward is worth this!

530 Deborah -- do you take Scientific American?  It's a good, reputable, magazine
531 that carries quite a few blockbuster stories in a very low key.  Granted, some
532 issues are dull, but for general keeping up it is hard to beat.  They had an
533 article on pulsars about 6mos to a year back that was an excellent overview
534 of just what they do and how and why they do it.  If you would like I'll try 
535 to find the issue.
536 
537 Bard -- I must have missed that reference.  I don't recall ARDEH (how about
538 a hint -- like author's name?  Or -- even-- a title to go with it?) but from
539 contex I deduce a supercomputer of some sort.  Knowing both our tastes in
540 literature and action away from the inn, it sounds like you may have a quite
541 difficult task in mind.  I'm game.

551 The man-scent was strong, but the thoughts were disorganized. Finally,
552 the cat decided that the man was asleep. Moving closer, he examined the camp.
553 Hmph! Not much here, maybe his dreams would be more informative...
554 ... he is seeking a female. Perhaps the one that had passed by earlier?
555 Not having a human type time-sense the cat wasn't sure how long it had been -
556 at least several sleeps.
557 The prairie-cat dragged a blanket over by the man and settled his 5 foot
558 body on the blanket. He would await morning and try to communicate with the

574 TO ALL INTERESTED: Dr Who has been written by a number of people. Let us
575 not forget that there is such a thing as "PENNAMES" and that a great many
576 writers use them quite freely and often.  As for Eric of Melnibone--
577 BOC is not the first group of musicians to use MM's stories for ideas
578 to wit, a band little known and appreciated in the USA, Camel. I can't
579 dredge up the name of the album nor the song(s) {tho' I have most of their
580 records} at this time. I will bring them here tomorrow. And a question
581 before I return to my work reality: what must a person do to get acquainted
