21 JUST SAW A THING ON ABC ABOUT 1984, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE
22 POSSIBLITIES IN REGARD TO 1984 AREN'T WHAT BOTHERS ME, IT'S
23 THOSE WIERDO'S WHO ARE RUNNING THINGS! THEIR NARROW MINDED
24 VIEW POINTS ARE FRIGHTENING! ONE SAID THAT THE MOST DANGEROUS
25 PROBLEM IS THE GOVERNMENT OBTAINING DATA FROM CORPORATIONS.
26 ANOTHER SAID IT WAS THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH OF THAT! AND THE
27 ABC GUY WAS BABLING THAT IT WAS NONE OF THAT, IT WAS ALL DUE
28 TO THE RUSSIANS! MEAN WHILE DR. EHRLICH WAS OFF ON HIS OWN
29 TANGENT ABOUT NUCLEAR DISASTER AND TO HECK WITH 1984! 
30 WE HAVE A VERY GOOD REFERENCE POINT TO BASE OUR CONCEPTS OF
31 FREEDOM UPON, IT'S CALLED THE 'BILL OF RIGHTS'. IT IS THE
32 CONTINUED EROSION OF THESE RIGHTS THAT WORRIES ME MORE THEN
33 ANYTHING ELSE. THIS IS THE VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR COUNTRY! THE
34 VERY CONCEPTS BY WHICH IT WAS FORMED! IT IS FEARFUL TO SEE
35 THESE RIGHTS SLOWLY BEING EATEN AWAY A LITTLE BIT A TIME AND
36 IN THE NAME OF FREEDOM ITSELF!!! NOTHING IS SACRED IF IT MEANS
37 THAT IT WILL ALLOW OUR SO CALLED LEADERS A GREATER AMOUNT OF
38 CONTROL OVER HOW THEY RUN OUR LIVES. AFTER ALL, "IT'S FOR OUR
39 OWN GOOD". THE POLICE NEED THOSE RECORDS SO THEY CAN ARREST US
40 BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING WRONG. THE IRS NEEDS THEM TO MAKE SURE
41 THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO CHEAT THEM OUT OF 10 CENTS. WE GOTTA
42 MAKE THOSE NASTY JOURNALISTS DEVULGE THEIR SOURCES SO THAT WE
43 CAN ARREST THEM SO THEY CAN'T SQUEAL ON OUR B'LOVED LEADERS
44 AGAIN! YES, WE CAN'T ALLOW OUR ALMIGHTY LEADERS TO LOOSE ANY
45 POWER OVER OUR LIVES. WHY.. WHY.. THAT WOULD BE ANTI-SOCIAL!

57 !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
58 HI, Y'ALL. HERE'S SOMETHING I WAS GOING TO PUT ON HERE A LONG TIME AGO, BUT 
59 DID'NT.
60 UTOPIA: TO ATTAIN UTOPIA IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE 
61 AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY. FOLLOW:1. YOU CAN'T PLEASE ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL 
62 OF THE TIME.2. ALL WOULD NOT AGREE ON THE WAY OR MANNER TO ACCOMPLISH THE 
63 DOING AWAY WITH SOCIAL AND POLITICAL EVILS.3. THERE IS NO HUMAN GOVERNMENT 
64 OR POLITICAL IDEAL THAT ALL PEOPLE SUBSCRIBE TO AS BEING RIGHT.4. MOST PEO-
65 PLE ASSERT THEIR OWN WILL OVER OTHERS.(NOT NECESSARILY WRONG BUT SOMETIMES 
66 SELFISH)5. ALSO, NO HUMAN GOVERNMENT OR INSTITUTION CAN CONTROL OR STOP 
67 SICKNESS, DEATH, OR POLLUTION.6. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN IDEA OF PROPER HUMAN
68 RIGHTS.WHICH A<LWAYS SUPRESSES OR EXCLUDES OTHERS DEEMED LESS THAN HUMAN BY 
69 THEIR OWN PARTICULAR PEER GROUP.
70 WE FIND OURSELVES LIVING AT THE HEIGHT OF THE "ME"GENERATION. (HOPEFULLY IT 
71 WON'T PROCEED HIGHER) MANY PEOPLE DO THEIR OWN THING TO THE EXTENT OF TAKING
72 FREEDOM AWAY FROM OTHERS, FOR INSTANCE CHILD ABUSE. AND BRINGING IMPOSSIBLE 
73 LIVING CONDITIONS FOR OTHERS, CONSIDER LOVE CANAL.
74 ANYHEY, SO THE ONLY WAY UTOPIA COULD BE ACHEIVED IS FOR THERE TO BE ONE GOV-
75 ERNMENT OR POLITICAL IDEAL ALL AGREED TO. ONE THAT COULD ALSO DO AWAY WITH 
76 SICKNESS, AND DISEASES, NOT TO MENTION DEATH.(HOW TRIVIAL) ALSO THEIR WOULD 
77 HAVE TO BE TRUE EQUAL RIGHTS.
78 AND WHO BELIEVES ANY OF THESE COULD BE ATTAINED?
79 BY THE WAY ANYONE KNOW OF ANY BB # IN THE SEATTLE AREA. I'D SURE APPRECIATE 
80 KNOWING A COUPLE.  BYE  ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

82 Hello, my name is Annie and I'm new to the Inn, but I've been observing for 
83 a little while now.
84 I've noticed some interesting topics come up so far.  For instance one sub-
85 ject that particularly interested me was that of Mysticism.  Exactly what 
86 are you refering to?  Spiritism or an evil of a sort within each one?  I 
87 feel that there is one who world wide along with associates are promoteing 
88 the increasing interest in mystic and occult matters. But he won't last
89 long. Something better is in the making, I wonder?

232 to THE DOCTOR:
233        As a struggling student on
234 the way to a Doctorate of Medicine,
235 I thought I would inform you and all
236 other users of an interesting bit
237 of information. I feel , as a new user
238 of this board, that an intelligent 
239 topic of discussion is in order.
240       How about "CIGARETTE SMOKING"?
241 
242 Cigarette smokers are at an increased
243 risk of premature death, usually from
244 bronchopulmonary or cardiovascular
245 disease. The life expectancy of an
246 average 30-yr-old (m or f) who smokes
247 15 cigarettes/day is shortened by more
248 than 5 yrs. The incidence of cigarette
249 smoking in the USA declined somewhat
250 after 1964 when health risks associated
251 with smoking were first widely stressed
252 but it is again on the increase and
253 poses one of the greatest public
254 health problems in the Western world
255 today.
256 
257 CHEMISTRYAND AND PHARMACOLOGY:
258 --------------------------
259  Tobacco smoke is a mixture of gases
260 and minute droplets of tar; nearly
261 1000 components of tobacco smoke 
262 have been indentified. Though some
263 components are filtered off as the
264 smoke is drawn through the unburned
265 tobacco, they are redistilled as
266 the burning ember advances, and the
267 smoke in each successive puff becomes
268 more concentrated. Since cigarette
269 smoke is less irritating than pipe
270 or cigar smoke, it is more likely
271 to be inhaled. Pipe or cigar smoke,
272 being more irritating, is less 
273 likely to be inhaled. Thus,pipe
274 or cigar smoking is much less
275 hazardous than cigarette smoking,
276 though it is not completely
277 innocuous.
278   Substances of medical importance
279 in the smoke may be separated into
280 four main groups:
281 
282   1. CARCINOGENS AND CARCINOCARCINOGENS
283 are present in the tar. Carcinogens
284 (principally polycyclic aromatic
285 alcohols) initiate cancer formation.
286 Cocarcinogens(including phenols,
287 fatty acids,and free fatty acids)
288 accelerate the production of 
289 cancer by other initiators. Many
290 cocarcinogens are also irritants.
291 
292   2. IRRITANTS cause immediate and
293 bronchoconstriction after smoke
294 inhalation, inhibit cilial action
295 in the bronchial epithelium, and
296 stimulate bronchial mucus secretion.
297 
298  (line should read "immediate cough")
299 
300   3. NICOTINE principally affects the
301 nervous system and is probably
302 responsible for a smoker's pharma-
303 cologic dependence on cigarettes.
304 The effects are complex and include
305 stimulation or sedation, depending
306 on the dose and on the smoker's
307 physical and physiologic state.
308 Nicotine indirectly affects the 
309 circulation by provoking 
310 catecholamine release which causes
311 tachycardia, increased cardiac
312 output,vasoconstriction, and 
313 increased blood pressure. Nicotine
314 also increases serum free fatty 
315 acid concentration and platelet
316 adhesiveness, and inhibits 
317 pancreatic bicarbonate secretion.
318 
319   4. TOXIC GASES in cigarette smoke
320 include carbon monoxide, hydrogen
321 sulphide, and hydrocyanic acid. The
322 average carboxyhemoglobin level in
323 persons smoking one pack/day is 
324 about 5%,compared to less than 1%
325 in non-smokers. This reduces the
326 amount of Hb available for O2 transport
327 and shifts the HbO2 dissociation curve
328 to the left, impairing O2 release
329 to the tissues. Exposure to carbon
330 monoxide may also increase 
331 atheroma formation.
332 
333 DISEASES RELATED TO SMOKING:
334 
335  1. Lung Cancer:Squamous cell and
336 oat cell lung carcinoma are 
337 associated with smoking. Epidemiologic
338 studies have shown that men who
339 smoke more than one pack/day are
340 about 20 times more at risk of
341 developing lung cancer than are
342 nonsmokers. The risk is greatest
343 in those who inhale, take more
344 puffs/cigarette, relight half
345 smoked cigarettes, and start 
346 smoking at an early age. Filter tips
347 may offer some protection.
348 Laboratory experiments show that 
349 tobacco smoke condensate can 
350 produce skin cancer in animals,and
351 that animals inhaling cigarette
352 smoke may develop cancer of the 
353 larynx or lung.
354 
355   2. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema
356 deaths are also about 20 times more
357 frequent in heavysmokers. Both 
358 diseases can be produced in animals
359 exposed to cigarette smoke. Pulmon-
360 ary function tests often show 
361 airflow obstuction in the small
362 airways even before chronic 
363 expectoration develops. The 
364 adverse effect of smoking on 
365 mucociliary clearance mechanisms
366 predisposes smokers to
367 bronchopulmonary infection.
368 
369   3. Cardiovascular diseases:
370 Cigarette smoking accelerates 
371 atherosclerosis and may double
372 the risk of myocardial infarction.
373 Smoking may precipitate an angina
374 attack or ischemic ECG changes in
375 patients with coronary artery 
376 disease. The risk of developing 
377 cerebrovascular disease, peripheral
378 vascular disease, or nonsyphilitic
379 aortic aneurysm is also increased in
380 smokers.
381 
382   4. Pregnancy: The mean birth
383 weight of infants born to mothers
384 who smoke during prgnancy is 6oz
385 less than that of infants born to
386 nonsmoking mothers. The incidence
387 of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth
388 , and neonatal death may also be
389 increased in pregnant women who
390 smoke.
391 
392   5. Extrapulmonary cancers:
393 Associated with smoking are cancers
394 of the mouth,pharynx,larynx,esophagus,
395 bladder, and pancreas.
396 
397   6. Peptic (especially gastric)
398 ulceration occurs more frequently 
399 and has a higher mortality rate
400 in cigarette smokers than in non
401 smokers. In addition, the effective-
402 ness of medical treatment for 
403 peptic ulceration is reduced, and the
404 rate of ulcer healing is slowed.
405 
406   7. Other conditions: Pulmonary
407 tuberculosis is more common in smokers
408 ,perhaps due to activation of old
409 tuberulous foci. Tobacco amblyopia
410 may be caused by optic nerve damgeage
411 due to the toxic action of cyanides
412 in cigarette smoke in smokers with
413 vitamin B12 deficiency (common).
414 Smokers are also liable to develop
415 gingivits and require early dental
416 extractions. Their physical fitness
417 is reduced because of impaired pulmonary
418 function and Hb transport of O2 to
419 the tissues.
420 
421 
422 I have tryed to point out some
423 interesting items on a subject 
424 of interest to all who care for
425 the quality of their lives.I hope
426 I have brought it to you in a manner
427 easily understood and as a new
428 year's resolve, Lets all stop
429 smoking.  For OUR Health.
430 
431 P.S. I would like to see more
432 conversing along these subject
433 lines in the future.
434 
435 questions on this info will be answered

452 Dear "future doctor":I have several bones to pick with you!
453 1.Most terminals have more than 40 column displays. Most of the terminals &
454 computers that don't, will "wraparound" to the next line. Thus you used 
455 TWICE as much space as was necessary. Please avoid this in the future!
456 2.Based on attendance at the BWMS "not-a-pizza-party", I don't really
457 think that there are all that many smokers on the system.
458 3.As long as they aren't forcing ME to breathe THEIR smoke secondhand, I
459 feel that if an adult wishes to smoke (or commit "slow suicide" in any other
460 way) that is their right.
461 4.There is a 5th category. "Unknown substances" which may have effects not 
462 being taken into account.
463 5.Finally, I'd like to have a discussion with you, too. Unfortunately,
464 neither your message, nor mine are anything other than monologues intended 
465 to lecture people on how "wrong" something is.

468   "future doctor":
469      A definate no-no in using 40 col; yet still worth dropping to the 
470 system. Addressing Leonards comments, we only had 2 out of 10 persons 
471 smoking (Alex, your friend was somking to, right?) at the N-A-P party.
472 Leonard's comment about "monologues intending to lecture people on how
473 'wrong' something is", was, I believe, unjustified. Your text was a clear,

503 I think one thing that should also be mentioned is that smoking is 
504 also considered disgusting by a large amount of people.  If they
505 want to ruin their helth, fine, but I don't want them doing it 
506 around me if humanly possible.

510       DOC:
511     THANKS FOR THE GREAT INFO ON SMOKING. THE SUBJECT, HOWEVER
512 HAS BEEN GONE OVER MANY TIMES(ALTHOUGH NOT IN THAT GREAT OF DETAIL).
513 HOW ABOUT SOME INFORMATION ON ANOTHER SUBJECT NOT AS COMMON?
514 HOPE TO SEE SOME FUTURE INSIGHTS ON MORE TOPICS.

516 P.S. WHERE DID OR DO YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

519 I.S.S: Yep, I think that our government has every right to control the lives
520 of its citizens, and in whatever way it sees fit. Though sometimes, I almost
521 agree with Scrooge. He said "Let them die, and decrease the surplus popula-
522 tion", and I might change that to say "Let them die, and help improve the
523 human gene pool", as those that will not do those things necessary to pro-
524 tect their own lives are contra-survival for the race, and deserve whatever
525 they get. But, in the process of killing themselves off, they place a burden
526 on the rest of society by sapping our reserves and sucking off us through
527 social welfare programs. So these people must be controled for their own
528 (and our own) good. We can't just ship them off to a Botany Bay, or some
529 other planet (though it might not be a bad idea for all you bleeding hearts
530 out there), but we can demand that they not damage themselves and then suck
531 off of the rest of us for the remainder of their lives!

536 HIS NAME IS, THE ONE THAT TALKS
537 SO PSYCHOLOGICAL SOUNDS LIKE A
538 REALLY WIERD PERSON!! I WOULD HATE TO MEET HIM. PLUS TH ARE
539 SOME REALLY WIERD OTHER PEOPLE  ON THIS SYSTEM. ARE THERE ANY REAL PEOPLE OU
540 OUT THERE OR ARE THEY ALL WIERD

553 It can be verified:   Kissing a smoker is akin to licking an ashtray. HUMBUG

558 The sysop could save a lot of the users and the bbs' time if it was
559 possible to go to a specific line and list on from that point.
560 rather than listing the whole thing.
561 Is there some way to do this?

593 Chance, everything is intact, Mikey just compressed the disk to allow Pam
594 her traditional signature to the "forgotten" disk on drive B.  But waste
595 not these lines on drivel!  Pam has the honor of tastefully wrapping it up!

600      AH, IT SEEMS THAT MY FINISHING DB HAS NOW BECOME A TRADITION.  I AM
601 TRULY HONORED!  AND "TASTEFULLY", TOO.  IT MAY BE HARD FOR ME TO LIVE UP TO
602 THOSE WORDS, BUT I WILL TRY TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.
603 
604      JON, AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS SECTION OF THE INN IS IGNORED ONCE A NEW
605 TABLE HAS BEEN OPENED IN A CLEANER PART OF THE INN, AND ONLY THOSE OF US
606 WITH A PERSISTANT DESIRE TO BE PARTY TO ALL THE CONVERSATION THAT OCCURS IN
607 THIS WELL USED ROOM WILL ENDEVOR TO USE THE REMAINING AREA.  I COLLECT ALL
608 THAT I CAN OF THESE CONVERSATIONS, AND I SHUDDER TO THINK THAT I MIGHT MISS
609 SOMETHING ALONG THE WAY, THAT SOME COMMENT (NO MATTER HOW INCONSEQUENTIAL)
610 MIGHT PASS ME BY.  SO IT SOON HAPPENED THAT I BEGAN FILLING THESE SPACES IN
611 ORDER THAT THEY BE FILLED BY SOMETHING, ANYTHING, AND NOT BE LEFT EMPTY AND
612 ALONE.  AND I REJOICE TO SEE THAT SO MANY HAVE RESPONDED THAT THEY DO LISTEN
613 TO WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER HERE, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BECOME INVOLVED IN HEATED
614 DISCUSSION IN MORE BRIGHTLY LIT CORNERS.
615      THE "COMPRESS" COMMAND THE OLD TIMER WAS REFERRING TO IS AN EDITING
616 FUNCTION HIDDEN BEHIND THE BAR, WHERE OUR BELOVED CISTOP MIKEY (NO LONGER
617 DESEASED, EH CYS?) CAN REMOVED THE EMPTY SPACE CAUSED BY DELETED LINES.
618 WHEN A LINE IS DELETED, RATHER THAN REPLACED, IT STILL FILLS SPACE ON THE
619 DISK, BUT CAN BE RETURNED TO US WHEN THE INNKEEPER PERFORMS HIS HOUSEKEEPING
620 AFTER HOURS.  SUDDENLY, SPACE IS OPENED UP OVER HERE, BUT MOST OF THE
621 PATRONS HAVE MOVED ON.
622 
623      ONCE AGAIN, THE INN IS IN TRANSITION.  SOME CUSTOMERS FROM OTHER TIMES
624 HAVE RETURNED, AND MANY OF THE DEBATERS HAVE LEFT, EITHER OUT OF BOREDOM,
625 ANGER, OR PERHAPS MERELY DUE TO THE NEED TO ATTEND TO OTHER ENGAGEMENTS.
626 SUCH CHANGE PRODUCES A FEELING OF MELANCHOLY IN ME, BUT ALSO ONE OF EXCITE-
627 MENT AS THE NEW REPLACES THE OLD, BUT RESEMBLING THE OLDER IN SO MANY WAYS.
