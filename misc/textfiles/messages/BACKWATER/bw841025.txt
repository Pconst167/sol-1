20 Leonard: I am reminded of a saying by Mr. Ford that went something like
21 'If I want an engineer, I hire one, not teach myself how to be one.'
22 I agree that the President shouldn't be concerned about every detail.
23 However, he should have at least a minimal understanding of the scope
24 of what is going on, and I don't think Reagan does. He has delagated
25 every aspect of the office to his underlings, and doesn't keep up with
26 what they are doing. Indeed, if what I have heard is true, he doesn't 
27 even try to (Re: his sleeping during cabinet meetings.) Mondale on the
28 other hand I find to be very out of touch with reality. If he truely 
29 believes as he has stated that the Russians won't build satilite weapons
30 if we don't. This despite the fact that they are doing so right now,
31 and have never in the past stopped building weapons just because we
32 did. As a matter of fact, they used the opertunity during the Carter years
33 to catch up with the US and in some aspects move ahead. Nor am I in favour
34 of Mondale's idea of taking money out of my pocket to feed his special
35 programs. I doubt very much that it will be used to affect the debt
36 given what I've seen the Democates do in the past. They are more
37 interested in spending money then trying to figure out where it will
38 come from. Increasing the money flow to uncle sam will only increase
39 the outflow. Besides, it doesn't really matter much if the money goes
40 out of my pocket to uncle, or never gets there in the first place,
41 I still can't use it. And when you get down to the bottom, that is
42 what concerns me, how much USEABLE money I have.

48 Leonard: I don't know, but it was a good start. Even a good deal of truth
49 to it. Say, I wonder what the Rashneeshee's are going to do now that it

51 I'm sure they will find some other trouble to get into.

53 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
54 I too find Reagan's John Wayne stance in foreign policy to be an overriding
55 concern.  It is of little comfort even to the few benefitted by supply side
56 economics to drive to a nuclear holocaust in a late-model car.  If the only
57 consideration you bring to the voting booth is the amount of useable money
58 you have, it is just as well that you are not participating in choosing our
59 government.

62 Obviously you can't read, I said it before, and I will say one more time.
63 I am voting, but not for YOUR idea of a candidate. I am very interested
64 it letting those that be know my feelings. Copping out and voting for
65 Fritz or Ronnie will not do that. That would only cause me to be one of
66 the mindless sheep that assumes you must vote for A or B or it will be
67 of no value. NOT TRUE!!! Now I am not so stupid as to beleive that my
68 voting for Mr. Non-of-the-above will make a major change, but then neither
69 will your voting for Fritz either. So instead, I have opted to make the
70 best use of my voting right to make as strong a statement about my feelings
71 that I can. Blending into the mass of sheep voting for A or B does not
72 do that. Rest assured, I will be voting for other offices as well, it
73 is only the presidency that I find neither candidate that has been placed
74 on the block to be acceptable to me. And I refuse to bow down to your
75 insinuation that I should vote for one of them just because you think I
76 should. By the very fact that I am intending to place my vote in a way
77 that must be counted, it insures that it will be counted in a form I
78 can accept. Which is better then not voting at all. Also, I don't know
79 where you get the idea that all I care about is how much money I have.
80 The point I was making if you go and reread the msg again is that I
81 don't see any difference between Reagan and Fritz economically. Either
82 way I loose. There are many other things I consider important if you
83 were to read my other msgs. I fully realize that Ronnie or Fritz will
84 be the next pres. (probably Ronnie given the lastest polls) but in my
85 opinion we lose in either case.

87 P.S. When was the last time you wrote your congressman? Did you know
88 that writing your congressman can have a bigger effect on his decisions
89 then anything else you can do? I consider this to be a far more effective
90 tool then to just vote for another carbon copy.
91 A letter can have the power of as much as 10 to 100 or more votes.

103 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
104    I'll leave the piper contentedly stuffing his face on the adventure to stop
105 in at the debate.
106    First --BRAVO MIKEY!!!  I fully intend to vote in the same manner.  I cannot
107 in clear conscience vote for the incompetent -- oops, incumbent president.
108 Sure, it's true.  He's competent as a figurehead and does a good job as long
109 as he gets at least one chance to rehearse his lines.  We have very little 
110 question as to who bought and paid for him, and who is reaping the benifits of
111 his years in office.  On the other side, we have Fritz the 'Crat.  I shan't
112 get into his supposed qualifictions other than to look at the manuvering that
113 it took for him to get to be the party nominee.  The stuff that shows on the
114 surface indicates that the SOB is about as slimy, unprincipled, and morally
115 taineted as any other politician.  I find the thought of him and ms. rich b...
116 rather unsettling.  I doubt that he is as good an actor as rotten Ronnie, so
117 is less likely to prove a popular figurehead.  He has promised the moon to
118 every special intrest group that he could contact -- and all those folks will
119 want to call in the debt if he gets the job.  Yuchh.
120   Between rotten Ronnie and Fritz the 'Crat there's no choice -- NoneOfTheAbove
121 will be my choice as well.
122   Economics -- what we're reaping now is the effects of the Vietnam war.  We
123 squandered too much of our nation's wealth in the jungles over there -- poured
124 too much of our national output, manpower and morale into a struggle that was
125 basically none of our business.  We fought that war on credit, and the bills
126 have been coming due a long time.  We never paid them, they still exist, and
127 the interest on the debt keeps building up.  I can't blame either party for
128 this mess -- both were equally guilty and ready to jump into a war that they
129 thought would offer some measure of economic stimulus.  It didn't.
130 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
131 Sorry, Mike, but 'none of the above' is not a vote that will carry a 
132 message to any politician; they know that only the winner in any election
133 counts, so any vote that doesn't affect who wins doesn't count. It can
134 be done any way you like- don't vote at all, vote for Donald Duck, none-
135 of-the-above, or vote for a certain loser- they are all the same, throwing
136 your vote away. Only a vote that threatens to alter the outcome is a vote.
137 Besides, a vote that obviously (to the politicos) isn't valid implies to
138 them a politically incompetent, and this is not what you want.
139 I know it means something to you, but communication requires both that
140 you say something, and that you say it in a way that can be understood
141 by whomever you are trying to talk to. Of course this is something that
142 a lot of politicians have trouble with too. A vote for Fritz is a vote
143 against Ronnie, a vote for no-one is a zero. I know you don't like
144 either of them, neither do I, but .....
145 ..................................BAD...................................
146 You are wrong. Sure, it doesn't count much, but they do take notice of it.
147 Maybe you don't remember the big worry about the increase in libertarian
148 votes, and independant votes and even Mickey Mouse votes last time.
149 And I very strongly disagree they see it as political incompetence, not
150 voting at all yes, but not voting for an alternate. Now like I said
151 before, I recognize that it won't make a whole lot of difference to
152 the outcome, but then niether would my vote make any real difference
153 if I were to vote for someone I cann't accept. At least I will be placing
154 my vote in a form that I can accept. A vote for Mr. None-of-the-above
155 is a vote against both Ronnie and Fritz not a zero vote. Voting for
156 someone I don't wan't is the zero vote. I would have wasted my right
157 to vote on something I don't believe in, and I refuse to do that.
158 Politicians do care about the people and how they feel. I know it
159 doesn't seem like it sometimes, but they do, because they know that
160 if they get too far out of line they won't get elected next time, or
161 worse get booted out immediately. Sure my vote for Mr. None-of-the-above
162 is a drop in the bucket. But at least maybe I'll get the bucket wet
163 instead of being lost in the ocean of votes by the other sheep.
164 And like I said above, if you REALLY are interested in your government,
165 you should write your congressman and tell him how you feel. Be they
166 republican or Democrate they listen to letters, because if you were
167 concerned enough to write a letter, they know that it is a subject of
168 importance to you.
169 Waving the flag once every four years hardly qualifies anyone as being
170 politically aware.

195 by the survivors? Testimony at the Nuremburg trials? Or something else?
196 (by the way, I thought that even the GERMANS who were on trial had admitted
197 to such things, but tried to excuse it as "only following orders"?)

207 					The Game
208 	"Something's wrong with the chessboard. My woman doesn't have any
209 feathers. And your dart needs sharpening.", said one of the three players,
210 pointing one hand accusingly at the playing field, and waving the other with
211 motions of disgust.
212 	I was above such simple bickering, mainly because I was sitting this
213 game out. But it wasn't hard to remember how hot the brain gets; how steamed
214 the emotions become when one gets involved in *The Game*.
215 	No one really knows the origins of *The Game*. Some say it was a
216 conglomeration of many games. An effort by the ruling Upper Crust to keep
217 the working Normals in line by giving them something complex to do in their
218 Off Time. There were many ideas, but no one really knew for sure.
219 	The argument at the table was getting louder, and the attention of
220 more and more non-playing Normals was diverted to the three participants. A
221 question of equipment condition seemed to be the main obstacle to *Good Play*,
222 which was always the desired goal in any round of *The Game*. But some players
223 would find any excuse to stall to give them a chance to rethink strategy, for
224 the other more important goal of *The Game* was *To Win*.
225 	Milt, a tall lanky male in his late teens was making most of the noise.
226 His left partner was a female Normal named Teed, and her left partner was
227 a quiet seemingly detached from the action Normal named Fife.
228 	Fife sat quietly while Milt gestured and spouted injustice about
229 everything. Teed tried to calm Milt, but to no avail. Pushing his chair back,
230 Fife stood up, revealing a muscular stature built on an enormous frame. He
231 continued to stand with arms crossed until the others noticed him and
232 quickly ceased their argument. Every eye in the Game Room was on Fife. His
233 lips, unaccustomed to speech, moved, but were not accompanied by sound. Still
234 the room hung on Fife's every movement. When at last his self-imposed silence
235 lifted, he uttered in a whisper like voice, "On with *The Game*."
236 	Fife returned to his chair, and the three resumed play. Never before
237 has I witnessed what in Fife's case could only be called an outburst. Fife
238 was not a talker. He was a heavy worker who toiled deep in the Mines digging
239 mineral deposits for Upper Crust amenities. Only the strongest worked this
240 type of job. Only the strongest and the quietest.
241 	The game continued without further interruption, and the audience, made
242 up entirely of non-playing Normals, returned their attentions to their own
243 little conversations, which not unexpectedly, centered almost exclusively on
244 Game Strategy.
245 	I, on the other hand, was interested in this particular game. From
246 examining the board positions, I decided that Fife held no particular point of
247 power, but his position was not without merit. It was painfully apparent that
248 Milt was the player in imminent trouble. His board position was very weak,
249 and his playing skills were deteriorating has his playing pieces decreased
250 in position and declined in number. Teed appeared to have the best position
251 of all, but would she capitalize?
252 	*The Game* raged for hours, and I made several mental notes of 
253 possible mistakes by the three players. One never knew who would eventually
254 show up as an opponent. It was a good idea to have as much background infor-
255 mation as possible.
256 	A yell from the table tore my gaze from the small Play-Stat board in
257 front of me to the table where the action was heating up. Milt was standing
258 now, and a quick scan of the board told me why; he had been eliminated. He
259 sank back down in his chair, his eyes never leaving the playing field where
260 his pieces now stood completely captured. Fife and Teed continued, but it
261 was now obvious that Fife was on A Roll, and it was only a matter of minutes
262 before Teed was gone too.
263 	After *The Game* was closed, and the losers removed from the building,
264 I approached Fife. Crossing in front of him as to not surprise him, I asked,
265 "You knew, when you stood up. You knew, didn't you?"
266 	"Yes.", he replied in a low raspy voice. "I knew I had them. I knew
267 I would win. I knew I would live to play *The Game* again. I knew...", his
268 voice trailed off, and he made for the exit. I did not follow.
269 	"Winning is tough,", I thought to myself, "but it's not as tough as
270 losing." With that thought, I left the Game Arena, and headed for my cubical.
271 I prescribed to the School of Preparation. I had to always prepare for *The
272 Game*.

325 I had changed in some sort of way.  When I awoke I saw Bard and a black Unicorn approaching.  He said not a word but 
326 helped me on Lucifer (his Unicorn), and we rode towards camp.
327 "Odd, still have my mental powers.  Lucifer's name came like a shot.", I mumbled.  Bard only half-paid attention, busy
328 finding the easiest path in the lovely forest.  "Bard, what has happened to the others?", I queried.
329 "Most of them have waited for you.  Piper has returned, bringing with him a tremendous appetite.  The good Friar has 
330 taken a walk with an old woman."
331 I was glad he didn't ask what had happened to me.  It seemed like he didn't want to know unless I told him.  
332 A pain shot through my head, and a vision sprang before my eyes: The Mad Actor was in the Valley!  The pain in
333 my head seemed to be due to some sort of popping noise in TMA's cloak.  Throwing a thought that way, it quieted down.
334 I noticed the scenes around me again.  We had found the camp, and everyone was standing near the breakfast fire 
335 commenting on Piper's capacity to eat.  I thanked Bard and Lucifer, and dismounted.  My necklace sparked attention.  
336 Piper even stopped eating.  "Behold all, the first step towards my destiny."  The necklace sparkled and glittered in 
337 response.
338 "I'm terribly hungry.  Piper, could you spare me a bit of that?"

377 I also see that the system will echo more backspaces than it executes. (I have
378 heard of this problem from others too...) One more thing to check out if we
379 ever get the source code.
380 MIG: Have you talked to Mikey about getting the ROMs yet?

390 A survivor of the camps, who lost his family there, took up on of these yoyi on the "proof" challenge.  Had to 
391 take the Yoyi to court, had to show the judge all the available evidence, had to jump through a hoop, etc.  The 
392 Yoyi still wouldn't accept the proof, but the judge did.  Made the holocaust a mater of public record.  never

397     HELLO
398     hi all,this is the International Trader here............folks
399 
400 One-who is the lead singer for the group Dokken?
401 Two-Who is the president of the Usa?
402 Three-Do you think this is a dumb poll?
403 --------------------International Trader--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
404 I ONLY KNOW IN MY WORLD
405                  I HATE THE LIGHT,
406                            I SPEED AT NIGHT......................
407 no ,voices just whispers in the wind,nofaces just places to begin..........
408 <(:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::)>
409 A bit of clearing up about polls....
410 Polls don't make an election, or at least they shouldn't.  Polls are legenda-
411 rily inaccurate.  Many people aren7't voting for Mondale because "aw, he won't
412 win anyway."  Well, it just so happens that polls often ignore segments of the
413 population that could be very important in the polls, mainly lower classes.
414 Most polls are telephone polls, so what about people without phones?  Are they
415 not going to vote?  Also, I'll bet that most pollsters aren't going to the
416 Bronx for a door-to-door.  Now, I'm not saying that Fritz is >>going<< to win,
417 and I'm not saying that you should vote for him.  But if you prefer him over
418 the Mad Actor (sorry, Mad Actor, but there is a paralllel), you should vote.
419 It >>will<< make a difference.
420                              ------------
421 All this talk about "Mr. None-of-the-Above" has reminded me of the student
422 body elections at our high school last year.  A friend of mine and I ran his
423 cat, Mouschi, for election.  This was intended for an outlet for those who
424 didn't care, or didn't care for the candidates.  Well, Mouschi got 8% of the
425 the vote, prehaps not too impressive, but beat out one candidate.  This is fine
426 for High School Elections, but I don't recommend it for something as impor-
427 tant as the presidential election.
428                              ------------
429 If you intent on voting for None of the Above, why not vote for Ian Rem Bem
430 Lem Plem Ptang Ptang Ole' Biscuit Barrel instead.  He's the Silly Party Candi-
431 date.

434 These days there seems to be a lot of negative sentiment aboput the
435 followers of the Bhagwan. It is understandable, but I tend to feel that
436 their only crime has been their abrasiveness. Catalyzed by the paranoiac 
437 Sheel Silverman, they acquired a sort of shoot first, ask questions
438 later syndrome, and they have alienated most Oregonians by seeming
439 not to care about anyone else. Maybe it's mostly just Sheela's mouth?
440 I still find the commune to be fascinating--I am a Rajneesh junkie,
441 and hope the much-feared violence in Wasco Co. doesn't appear.
442 I also hope the Rajneesh are able ot find a home and build a city free of
443 objections and persecution. Wherever they go in the world, they will
444 have a hard time planting a new city in a rural area. I think the
445 whole damn world is zoned. And it is easy to see how the rajneeshees
446 might begin to feel frustrated and persecuted in the face of so many
447 seemingly needless barriers to their dream. They may have been thoughtless in
448 disregarding the law and talking out of both sides of their mouth(s). But
449 they may have had reason to be distrustful themselves.
450       At any rate, it is difficult to see the other side when you have 
451 "the only religion". Witness the fundamentalist Christians, and the
452 beloved of Islam. It takes all kinds, though. I kind of hope they stay.
453 They paint a swath of color across the ethnically dull canvas of
454 Oregon's demography.

509 Piper obligingly gave me a portion of his food, and I ate it with relish as he studied the necklace.  Bard mumbled, 
510 "Incredible power generated by such little mass..."  Piper thought a bit, and said, "Not generated, my friend.  I think
511 this little trinket provides a conduit for energy to pass through.  Where it
512 comes I know not."
513 Further hypotheses were put forth, but only this one survived the debate.  I personally hadn't thought of the gateway
514 angle.  "What do you suppose 'Two thus joined, half thus made' means?", I said to no one in particular, finishing the
515 last of the food.
516 "I think that little item you're wearing is incomplete.  Tell us how you got it.", Bard said.
517 I went and as clearly as possible I told them what had happened.
518 "You say they flew together?  Then there must be two more pieces.  Four altogether.  You have two, so 'half thus made'.
519 The question now is where to find the other two pieces..."
520 I suddenly noticed a puddle of water creeping closer to our camp.  CREEPING?!?  I looked again, and yes, that puddle 
521 WAS creeping along.  It stopped about five yards away, and spoke.  #I am Gyre.  I hold the key to the third portion of
522 your dilemma."  How convienient, I thought.
523 Piper also had his doubts.  "All right, so tell us what the solution is."
524 "First you must tell me what I am to shoow you.", the puddle said.
525 "What?  We're supposed to KNOW what you're to show us in order for you to be able to show us?"
526 "To be brief, yes.", the puddle answered.
527 Cripes, I thought, talking to a puddle.  Oh well.  "We must think.  We have discovered two powers, one red and one 
528 green.  The other two must also have colors.  Now, the green power is destruction, obviously."  Everyone thought back
529 to the Gazebo.  "Now, all that is left is to find out what the Red and the unknown powers are."
530 The puddle seemed to smile, as hard as that is for a puddle.  "Quite good reasoning, but I won't say if it is correct or
531 not.  Tell me what I am to show you."

536 ?????????????????????????????????????????????
537 what was that just above?
538 
539 					or does anybody care?
540 
541 mike, who cared about the votes for Mickey Mouse? I beleive it was the
542 press, who could use it for a laugh in what was otherwise a very dull
543 election report. Not thwe poiticians. But do salve your ego, it may be
544 the best thing to do with a vote if the polls mean anything. Times have
545 been relatively good, and any politian now in is claiming responsibility.
546 I only wish they were right, but , tho I know they can damage the 
547 economy, I have serious doubts about thier ability to help it, especially
548 in view of what is truly known about what drives the economy.
549 
550 A few line above the sentiment was expressed that anyone has the right to
551 speak out in favor of any view, no matter how 'wrong'; this is a very
552 dangerous use of freedom of speech. Do you believe in the right to 
553 yell "fire!" in a full theater? to teach that you can fly if you believe
554 it strongly enough, and the building is tall enough?
555 If a claim is made, and someone believes it, but it isn't true, how much is
556 that person hurt? How much is the truth damaged? This is 1984, and newspeak
557 was an important weapon in the book. Trying to hide the truth about WWII
558 isn't going to help anybody who doesn't plan to sell a book claiming
559 hokum. But then we who use BWMS think for ourselves, so here is a good
560 safe place to say hokum.

569 I have a large stack of cards, pink in colour, that contain all kinds of info on folks who frequented BW in the past. I
570 look to them now, and find no traders, international or otherwise, around. The hunt is afoot. I gather the required 
571 materials, dust off the old twit-whistle. A soft blow, "pirate software!" the whistle whistles. It will be easy.
572 Theus:Chard and I have discussed the matter. The fact that the interface card, with its custom chips and about .6 of the
573 modem hardware, was left behind, makes me wonder as to the motive. Perhaps a stupid user of another computer type? or 
574 somebody who is pissed at MLC? I have another modem, but a few mods need to be made to use it on an apple2. Also the 
575 software must change. I think I need to talk with the normal inhabitaints of the little room. Call me sometime when your
576 voice phone works again.

586 L'homme: Yes, I did indeed get the msg, sorry I didn't reply sooner,
587 What with everything else going on, I plumb forget! I just got thru
588 spending the weekend building a H150. I shall be waiting for said same disk(s).
589 one final note to the debaters, and then i shall move on to other
590 subjects, and not speak of it again. most people who vote for 
591 someone (thing?) that does not exist on the ballot 	
592 recognize that the person/thing will not win. the purpose of
593 voting the way they do is to make a statement. be it a vote
594 for a libitarian, or mickey mouse. (sorry about the lack of
595 caps, this stupid computer just decided to not let them thru
596 anymore, and i forgot the command to get things back to normal.)
597 as a result, it doesn't really matter for the point of end results 
598 who you vote for if you don't vote the ticket. since i feel both
599 canidates are unsuitible for the office, i find that i am unable
600 to vote for either one.. after all, that is the purpose of the vote
601 to chose the person you wish to have in the office. since i feel
602 neither one is acceptable, i must vote for another way. since i 
603 know also that it won't prevent one of the two from winning, i
604 have decided to vote the way i want to which is for mr. none-of-
605 the-above. this satisfies me, and still places my mark outthere
606 as a voter which provides a count of those who voted for other
607 then the two canidates. (this BAD is what i was talking about when
608 i indicated the concern that occured during the last election. they
609 don't care about mickey mouse being voted for, it is the fact the
610 a rather significant increase in people voting for other then the
611 two given canidates that caused concern, as this leads to the obvious 
612 realization that maybe the parties are not meeting the needs and
613 wants of the citizens as well as they should if they are loosing
614 voters. this is also the reason why they keep track of those who
615 don't vote at all. though that is a bit more touch to figure out,
616 since it could be a. the peole are happy, so why bother with it,
617 or b. they are feed up with the whol mess, and feel that voting 
618 won't make any difference.) why should they be concerned about 
619 loosing voters? simple, most elections are won by narrow margins,
620 and a loose voter can possibly be swug back, or lost to another party.
621 or worse, (shudder) cause an independant canidate to be voted to office.
622 i realize that some of you out there are satisfied with one of the 
623 canidates, and that's fine too. but don't tell me i have to vote ofr
624 one of them. i do not find a situation of lesser of two evils here,
625 only equal (different aspects yes, but still bad) evils. as someone
626 said before (i forget who, but thank you.) i consider it to be the
627 difference of pointing a gun at my head, or being asked to take poison.
628 i prefer to say no thank you.
