66 it was noon.Go to the FOUNTAN for some
67 insprition see the new figuration and
68 if nothing else put myself in a public
69 sitution.The rainless clarity of bright
70 afternoon sun did seen a bit odd but I
71 reminded myself I don't like averages.
72 The next stop was to a convient department store to purchace some flat 
73 black and white paint .Think in terms ofpulldown menues ,icons for every conciviable form,and on again-off again
74 imagery.It seems that nothing will be
75 acomplished unless a 100% effort is     employed at least to start the process.
76 The phone book specificely the yellow 
77 pages seem a excellent source of those

137 since the passing of Sparrowhawk.  Much of the lore has been lost since then,

143 (UPI Gresham, OR)  Arson was suspected as the cause of a fire in a warehouse
144 here early Tuesday morning.  The raging fire almost entirely destroyed the
145 Nuts, Fruits and Flakes Warehouse, necessitating the use of 8 fire engines 
146 over 50 fire-fighters to control it.  While most of the area remains too hot
147 to investigate, several crates used to hold weaponry were recovered.  Al-
148 though partially destroyed, authorities were able to positively identify the
149 crates by their serial numbers as belonging to the US Army shipment that was
150 hijacked Monday.  As of this morning, none of the trucks, drivers or weapons
151 has been recovered.  The Multnomah County Sheriff's department spokesperson,
152 I. M. Lyon, said in a press conference that the police had "several leads"
153 and were confident that they would "soon apprehend" the people involved.

213      Fog covered the hillsides, making it damp, cold and lonely for the 
214 men walking up from the mill.  The chatter slowly died out as the men headed
215 to their assigned areas.  One man, wearing slightly newer clothing than the
216 rest, looked at his clipboard.  He had fifteen men assigned to him today, and
217 while most of them were hard workers, the luck of the draw had given him the
218 two most notorious slackers, who had an almost magical talent for producing
219 the absolute minimum amount of work needed to keep from being fired.  If he 
220 had had his way, the two would have long since been sent down the road, to the
221 Weyerhauser mill or whatever work they could find.  He didn't want any lazy
222 men messing up his production bonus, no sir!  Well, he would just have to keep
223 a sharp eye on them today.  With the fog the way it was, he should be able to
224 get right up next to them before they knewhe was anywhere around--and if he
225 caught them on the ground, there'd be hell to pay. 
226      "I guess I better start the day off right," he said to himself, adding 
227 "I'll go see how things are going with the Allen boys."  The Allen boys, all
228 five of them, were working under him today.  They were notorious for how hard
229 they worked--and how hard they played.  They had a reputation in the taverns
230 from Seattle to Sacramento for drinking hard cider, throwing hard punches, and
231 loving hard women.  Randy Allen still had a scar or two on him from a saloon
232 girl in Portland.  Telling her that he wasn't going to marry her was one thing,
233 but then turning his back to her--well, that was just plain foolish.  He was
234 lucky the knife she carried in her garter had hit ribs, and not his heart.  
235 Mike Allen was the oldest, and smallest, but most folks agreed that he was the
236 toughest too.  He'd been shanghai'd in one of the bars in Portland.  Only 17, he
237 didn't know enough about the world to refuse the free drink the bartender 
238 offered.  He woke up two days later with a head that felt like it had been split
239 with a double-jack, and the worst case of sea-sickness ever seen on any ship
240 ever.  He managed to survive only by refusing to eat any meat while he was on
241 board.  Even the smallest aroma of salted pork still made him grab for his gut,
242 and he never quite managed to put back the weight he had lost at sea.  He jumped
243 ship in Astoria, and walked back to Portland, swearing eternal vengeance on the
244 bartender.  He still hadn't found him, but he kept looking...one day he would
245 come to some little backwater town, walk into the only saloon it had, and there
246 that bartender would be.  He wasn't planning to kill him, exactly, but he was
247 going to take a hunk of flesh or two off the bartender.  If the bartender died,
248 why, it was probably better that way.

257      After much struggling and confusion the four were soon in Marci's
258 Benz and heading for home. Jack was singing "tip toe thru the tulips"
259 in the back seat and Tony was asleep, head in Tina's lap.
260      A car appeared to be following, but Marci shook her head figuring
261 she was imaging things when the first bullet hit the rear window. Tony
262 was awake instantly shouting " Dad, your home?" A second bullet followed
263 within seconds and shocked the foursome into reality. "Hit the Gas" yelled
264 Tina, nearly blowing out Tony's eardrums in the process, The Benz lurched
265 forward and Marci soon had left the other car behind.
266      Another scream soon Mawas heard as Marci spotted the blood dripping from
267 Jacks arm, No wonder they hadn't heard anything out of him since the shots.
268 Jack was in shock and within the minute Marci had changed direction and 
269 was heading for an emegency ward.  It's a good thing Jack has so much beer
270 in him thought Marci, I bet he doesn't feel a thing.
271      Tina and Marci paused and looked at each other, someone else must know
272 their plans, what else would warrent this attack?  But who and how? Or are
273 we just paranoid?

335    The hot tropical sun beat down upon a strange scene.  An unknowing
336 observer would perhaps think that this was some arcane (and highly 
337 inefficent) method for clearing farmland.
338   Several large palm-fiber ropes led from a large stump to a winged beast
339 resembling a horse.  Upon close observation, our hypothetical observer could
340 notice careful padding under the ropes as they passed over the winged horse's
341 body.  Near the strange scene, a single man clad only in a knee-length
342 kilt with a thin gold band around his neck (upon VERY close observation,
343 markings resembling a creature biting its own tail would show) was encouraging
344 the winged beast's apparent efforts to uproot the stump.
345   "C'mon Peg!" he was urging.  The sheen of sweat coating his body somehow
346 showed how unused to the heat he was. 
347   The wind of the pegasus' wings beating against the resistance of the ropes
348 whirled up bits of sand and grass to coat the piper's skin with a gritty
349 overcoat.  The pegasus' exertions had caused her coat to become slick with
350 sweat also; it stained the padding where the wrist-thick twisted fibers of
351 the rope crossed her back.
352   "Enough, Peg," the piper called.  The mighty wings ceased beating and the
353 piper slid the ropes from around the pegasus' body.  He caressed her neck 
354 as he led her to the welcome shade under a nearby grove of palms.  Stopping
355 near a small heap of assorted ropes and other gear, the piper took a length
356 of absorbent fabric and began rubbing the pegasus down.  His gentle hands
357 carefully felt every muscle and tendon in her body, travelling from the hooves
358 along her legs, massaging the muscles, feeling the joints.  He paid particular
359 attention to the wings, smoothing the feathers, carefully tending the joints
360 and attachment to her frame.  The main flight muscles recieved a careful 
361 massage and the piper smiled in approval at their firm resiliency.  His
362 fingers lingered sofly over several nearly invisible scars on her flanks.
363 The one-terrible wounds were now only slight ridges of scar tissue in the
364 velvet softness of her skin.  Scar tissue on the skin -- and terrible
365 memories in the mind.
366   Finished with the rubdown, the piper put his arms around the pegasus' neck
367 and rested his head against her.  The pegasus stood silently, pressing back
368 in evedent affection.  So they stood for an endless moment, consumed in
369 memories, until the piper realized that the pegasus had cooled from her 
370 exertions.
371   "Let's go, Peg!"  He ran off through the trees followed by the pegasus.
372 Soon the two were splashing in a clear pool, washing off the grime and

388 (UPI Bajkneeshpure, OR)  A shootout was narrowly avoided here today as Oregon
389 State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, acting on an anony-
390 mous tip discovered the US Army trucks hijacked Monday.  In the back of each
391 truck was its bound and blindfolded driver.  As OSP helicopters flew over-
392 head, over 100 officers and agents surrounded a deep gulch deep inside the
393 former Small Clean Ranch.  There, they discovered 25-30 Bajkneesh Peace Force
394 officers with the trucks, all armed with automatic weapons.   After several
395 tense minutes of confrontation, the Bajkneesh threw down their weapons and
396 allowed themselves to be arrested for illegal possession of firearms.  The
397 Bajkneesh claimed to know nothing about how the trucks got there, but had no
398 answer when asked why they had automatic weapons.  As of press time, the
399 testimony of the drivers had not yet been revealed.   No weapons were found,
400 prompting speculation on the part of police as to what the Bajkneesh had done
401 with the seven truckloads of munitions.

408 (UPI Bajkneeshpure)  27 members of the Bajkneesh religious sect are being held
409 pending bail in the Wasco County jail.   The Bajkneesh were arrested on charges
410 of illegally possessing automatic weapons, and are suspected of hijacking a
411 US Army munitions shipment Monday.  The drivers of the convoy revealed that
412 the road they were traveling on had been blocked up front by several Rolls-
413 Royces.  When the drivers got out to investigate, they were immediately 
414 surrounded by a group of green-clad men.  The drivers reportedly said the
415 clothing was "identical" to that worn by the followers of the Bhagwan Shree
416 Bajkneesh.  Bajkneesh spokesperson Mama And Sheela, at a press confrence, lost
417 her voice after a 15 minute lecture on the purity of the Bajkneesh motives, and
418 was replaced by a temporary spokesperson, Ma Sha Na Na.  Ma Sha Na Na stated
419 that the Bajkneesh "definitely weren't involved" in the hijacking and accused
420 Governor Vic Atiyeh of using the Bajkneesh as a scapegoat for the theft.  The
421 governor's office had no comment on the charge.

433    I stood, letting the sheet fall only to where I would be cold if it fell any further. I slapped my arm against my warm neck
434 omehow hoping to cure the crick there.
435 
436   I nodded my head down, opening the nape of my neck to my dabbing hands. Still it ached with the slightest twist of the neck.
437   Forgetting the pain, I fucused my eyes. I knew they must be bloodshot. I perceived, the floor, foot rest, chair,couch, all
438 the blankets and pillows twisted on the couch, and over, over there was the bed.
439 
440   The bed, with it's tangled covers and sheets. The firm form, held to lines against the sheets. Twisted inside, sprawled in
441 the covers, there she was.
442 
443   She looked wanton, lips pressed full against the mattress, eyes closed, lids looking darker where skin  parted for eyes. Her
444 short hair was still up around her neck. The nape of it, the mark of feminine beauty, shielded with hair, white lines still
445 held the curves.
446 
447   It seemed right, a head nodded down in some stupid attempt to fight back pain, a shiver had rippled through my body, I was
448 fighting against sleep. Same thing, sleep and stupidity.
449 
450   Same thing.
451 
452   I stalked off to the kitchen, cold feet slabbed their stumbling way across the tiled floor, the light switch flooded the
453 hallways with yellow light.
454 
455   It flooded under the bedroom door, also casting a thin visible line across the sleeping girl. White sheets absorbed the
456 light, illuminating them selves.
457   The white sheets still looked gray. Except a sparkling twinkling light of a small teardrop sliding down her cheeks.
458   The knife slammed into the cutting board, the apple was cut. It would have been easy, there was no need to slam the knife.
459 
460   Minding my fingers, I wiped the juice slowly down away from the length of the gleaming blade. Gleaming and sharp, dangerous.
461   The knife slid through the flesh easily, soon blood filled the slice in the skin, I looked down, saw the red drip into the
462 sink. I perceived, my finger, the red crevasse.
463 
464   I dropped the knife, it's stainless steel hit the sink with a loud noise. I slabbed my feet quickly along the tiles, into
465 the bathroom. The mirror, my hand found the edge, pulled open the cabinet door.
466 
467   I was wrapping the band aid around my finger. She was at the door way, looking mad at me.
468   "What did you do?" She demanded.
469   "Nothing." I snapped.
470   "Lie." She answered.
471   "Band aid!" I soothed.
472 
473   I laid her down, pulled a sheet to her neck, told her to sleep, kissed her. She kissed the air, a gesture, she meant love.
474 
475   She did not mean it, not then, she was too frustrated, I never trusted her, not enough.

482 Hey guys, anybody remember the infamous Grizzly.  The last time i called
483 about 6 months  ago i was staring down the  barrel of a gun.  Well that 
484 was 6 months ago and STUDLYU  me got his way out of another almost imposible 
485 jam.  What is going on with the romance stories.
486 You people (at least i think you all are people) include to much kissing and
487 cuddling before they supposedly have sex, but you disconect before anything 
488 happens. Anyways
489 i called to let everyone know that I will be getting my own system soon. So
490 no more calling from friends houses every 6 months.  You will just
491 have to put up with me.  Mig if you are out there in lurk mode i would just 
492 like to say one thing. I am going to embarase you.
493 All i can tell you you is i have been talking to brian
494 about some of your actions and believe me the FBI CIA KGB Dwid City are
495 after you.

502 Somethings just can't be left unsaid, so I'll be the first to say them...
503 GRIZZLY:  What's your problem? Can't the actions of (sometimes) real life be communicated here without a critic snapping 
504 at every individuals attempts?  This is becoming TOO COMMON an occurance. I nearly weep at the fact that The INN has taken
505 on somewhat the appearance of a Video Parlor rather than the Respectable Establichment of Civilized Conversation and Story-
506 telling greatly heralded by many and held in great regard by more than a mere few. If the current state of events shall 
507 continue, weep I shall for it will mean that the backwaters have become muddied to the point of recognition.
508 I am now at a loss for words to you.  phooie.

519 GRIZZLY: You wouldn't perhaps be related to Gang Green? Anyways, I will try to
520 approach the rest of this note to you in a polite and rational state. You don't
521 like sappy romances. OK, I don't think Knifewielder's story was one and it had
522 kissing in it (horrors!). (no I didn't mean Gang Green, sorry. I meant Police-
523 man)...... I do not mind critisism, I do hate unconstructive critisism. If you
524 really dislike the romances, perhaps you should go about telling us a different
525 way. I'm about ready to say in one of those high piched, sassy voices "If you
526 can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all." I don't think the romances
527 are in bad taste. If you wish to read straight sex, there is a large selection
528 at your local bookstore, as well as a better selection at an "adult" bookstore.
529 ADRIAN: Good. (I can not use a more expressive word, you are draining my vocab-
530 ulary of them).
531 KNIFEWIELDER: (if you are wondering who this is, it's the person who wrote the
532 story about the man with the knife. you mnow the apple and all). I hope you do
533 not mind that I have given you a name. You "signed" with none and I don't 
534 remember your borders, if indeed you had them. Interesting... please continue.
535 I liked it... I think. Puzzled. But do continue.

552 	Ian, do I have news from you. Our safe house in NW Portland was just smeared. I know that is hard to 
553 believe, but when 50 members of eastern Oregon's finest fighting force come-a-callin' there is not much the
554 10 of us can do, especially when we were not totally prepared for battle. Remember this is a safe house. Poor old
555 Dangerfield's followers took the place over, but not before half of them joined the ancestors in time for tea. We lost
556 four junior agents before we escaped. They fought a gallant rear guard action, allowing the rest of us to escape
557 unscathed. I would suggest a call on Puff the Magic Dragon ala John Wayne and "The Green Berets." We got Farley out,
558 and Fellows and I are escorting him back to our secondary base at Ione Plaza near the local university here. Joshua went
559 on another mission which he wouldn't talk about. It is good to have him back, but he sure has been acting strange. Now for
560 the greatest news: Gaudy Minsky is missing. So is Flemming. We can't seem to keep track of all our agents in this city
561 for more than a few minutes at a time. After we get back to Ione Plaza and get suited up, Fellows and I are going to search
562 for Gaudy. I think it might be advisable to allow Farley to accompany us on this mission. It would allow us to observe him
563 under stress-load conditions, and see how he reacts to various mission stimuli. I think he is on the level. He may have been
564 misguided in the beginning, but I think he has found the right track now. I will contact you via COMSET tomorrow with
565 additional details. Wish us luck.

576 the summer of '81. 3000 yards of toilet paper, two dozen FOR SALE signs, and a port-a-potty from a nearby construction sight
577 completed the decorations. I am leaving out some of the more obscene and poor-taste things done to the school. But of course

594 (UPI Portland)  Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents, accompanied
595 by members of the Defense Intelligence Agency arrested a local man, Mike Day,
596 for possession and distribution of confidential material.  Agents broke down
597 the door at approximately 10 PM Pacific time, surprising Day as he was working
598 with a large number of electronic devices at his kitchen table.  Unconfirmed
599 reports state that he was hauled off protesting his innocence, saying that the
600 devices were "merely disk drives, I was just trying to fix them."  One agent,
601 speaking on the condition that he not be named, said "Day better hope we can
602 throw the book at him.  If we can't, the Bajkneesh are dying to get their hands
603 on him."  Day's home has been sealed off, as agents will return later to try
604 and discover exactly how the confidential material, involving the recent hi-
605 jacking of a US Army convoy, was distributed.

609 was known to have killed at least two men in barroom brawls.  He said he didn't
610 mean to, he didn't realize that heads could be broken when hit with a chair--
611 which was what he used the first time--or a full bottle of bourbon, which was
612 what he used the second.  The end result was the same, though: a dead man, and
613 a state he could never return to.  The Oregon Police, though knowing what he'd done, left him alone.
