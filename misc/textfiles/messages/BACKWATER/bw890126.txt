 70    Check the last 100 lines of disk B.  You'll find a remarkably
 71 poor continuation of the "bagel" story.  I wrote that stuff
 72 off the top of my head.  Making a sequel is h*ll, but it keeps my
 73 mind going.
 74  
 75    The land of Minix does not lend itself to such graceful powerhouses.
 76 - Least they be re-invented.
 77  
 78    Friar, my own philsophical knowledge is practical and somewhat limited
 79 in scope.  Would you care to give the views of Mr. Russel, so I may
 80 understand future discussions?  As a failed idealist, I tend to look
 81 on the bright side too much...I think?

 87    With an unsettling lurch, his stomach informed him that he had missed
 88 lunch.  Dashing back inside, the refrigerator stood like chest of gold,
 89 waiting to be opened.  Yanking on the door, the inside revealed several
 90 quick prospects: luncheon meat, Monteray Jack, white bran bread, and
 91 some light mayonaisse (sp - ack, more sp's!).  Slamming and banging
 92 drawers and cupboards, he quickly assembled two sandwhiches, and
 93 satiated his appitite in a few minutes.  The two were followed by the
 94 remnant orange juice from breakfast.
 95  
 96    A sudden beam of sunlight struck his cheek from the dining windows.
 97 The day was mostly over, and the night would be here soon.  More work
 98 had to be done before he could use the CarbonPlas in the workshop.
 99  
100    But he changed his mind.
101  
102    A Day's work he had done.  Everything was prep'd, stored, saved, or
103 recorded.  It was time to stop working.  It was time to Relax.
104  
105    After returning the smock to the lab, he showered yet again, but
106 only soaking his body against the warm water and steamed air.  Emerging
107 a half-hour later in his robe, he asked the house for some music.
108  
109    Some ancient country-western song that had never even heard of music
110 ratings (much less carried one) blared from every corner of the house.
111 "VOLUME!" he screamed, and the annoying din died to a quite talk.
112 "Change Music" he asked, and the house quickly scanned for music,
113 locking in on a local station playing a relaxing instrumental.
114  
115    He then seated himself and pondered.  Actually, he thought about things
116 that most humans take for granted:  Why are we here?  Who am I?  Where
117 do I come from?  Is this all there is, or is there more?
118  
119    The questions circled in a vicious loop, like buzzards awaiting the
120 last gasp of some wounded animal.  Somehow, without thought (or was
121 it effort?) on his part, the answers came to him.

215 The fiend strie me blue!  I'm scarce able to walk,
216 And damn me if I can stand upright or talk!
217 Here, landlord, bid Betty to summon a chair;
218 I'll try home for a while, for my wife is not there!

328  
329    Hagbard Celine was taken from an off-beat and quite "radical" trilogy
330 called "The Illuminatus Trilogy".  The son of a Norwigian Father and
331 Sicilian Mother, he was a Guru, Naval Architect, and a great deal of
332 other things as well.  Throughout the trilogy, he represented the
333 "ideal" man, as well as the "ideal" man's faults.  I can't reveal
334 too much more about this strange character without spoiling one of
335 the best-written stories I've seen in quite awhile.
336  
337    For those who have NOT read the whole trilogy, I advise you to do so,
338 but in the process, I also advise you to remember that this stuff is
339 NOT for the MEEK and MILD.  It is a very explicit story, and also contains
340 many sections that require re-reading to understand what is being said.
341 You will also find many other "mini-stories" within the series itself,
342 each of which is entertaining.  If you like mystery,
343 science fiction, conspiricies, or watching your mother's eyes bug out as
344 she reads it, then I do recommend it to you.  I guess one of the main
345 reasons I've always been attracted to it comes from a small amount
346 of paranoia I have accumulated over my short years. (No, I don't glance
347 over my shoulder every 10 seconds.  But I don't like being outside at
348 dark.)

416 I liked your poetry AD. About the snow, I just got done watching the news
417 on 4 and 6 and there is a definite 2-4 inches either tonight or in the next
418 couple days on the SURFACE LEVEL! Some cold arctic crap is coming down here
419 from Alaska and it will go right over us, temperatures may even get into
420 the single digits in the next few days. The best thing about all this is

517 Yes, I hear there will be more, with very low low temperatures. Sure I
518 care about music. Um, I basically just listen to the radio, but there
519 are some specific groups that I like. The album that you mentioned, I
520 forget the exact name, I have not heard of that group. Are they good?
521 Re-enter the name ok?
522 The difference between to and too is as follows AD:
523 To -- Used to specify a direction. Ex: I am going <to> the store.
524                       (or place of travel)
525       Used to ask questions. Ex: What are you going <to> do today?
526       The infinitive form of verbs: <to> swim, <to> ski
527                                     Ex: I like <to> swim.
528 Too -- Used to say also. Ex: I like music <too>.
529                              Do you like the radio too?
530                              Does he like the snow too?
531                     Same as: Does he like the snow also?

584 Hmm, the system locked up on me the last time I logged in. Strange.
585  
586 Sorry I didn't answer you before Vision. The group I mentioned was REM. their
587 latest album is called Green. If you only listen to the radio you might find
588 them to be a bit strange.
589  
590 Good sound track music I think. But then I'm biased. The song by them that is
591 being played on radio now is called stand. "stand in the place were you live,
592 now face north. look in that direction, wonder why you've never before."
593  
594 Or somthing like that. Their last album sold over a million copies. The big 
595 tune off of that one was "the one I love." "This one goes out to the one
596 I love, This one goes out to the one I left, behind. Another prop to 
597 occupy my time. This one goes out to the one I love."
598  
599 There was another song on that album that had some lyrics I really liked. 
600 "...land of gentry rationalize. Look who bought the mint, buy a gingle, buy
601 America."
602  
603 one last one from there third album called can't get there from here.
604  
605 whoops, their not there. 
606  
607 "go ahead mister city wide hypnotize suit and tye, tell me is it justified."
608  
609 I'm not sure these quotes really catch their music. Try anyting by them I like 
610 it a lot. Took me a few listens at first, But now they are my favorite group.

732 Well things are really hoping. All this prose makes me wish I had a better 
733 grasp of the Eglish tounge.
734  
735 Alas (As Pournelle is wont to say.) I seem to be devoid of the ability to
736 write in the clear and flowing verbage that is so common to many who pass
737 through the portal and enter the Inn.
738  
739 Milch, You really must try to get here more often. Those of us who people the
740 Inn are in need of leadership. A higher profile by you oldtimers would really
741 help us out.
742  
743 I hope to begin writting again soon. I just havn't been in the mood. My last 
744 session really went badly.
745  
746 Will we ever see disk c? good examples are a great source of learning.

801 Thanks AD, ABYSS, and KKKIIILLLRROOY, I'm glad that some one around here
802 still likes me. Killroy, I thought it might have been the CHAMP because he
803 didn't talk to me for a while back. Actually, he wouldn't do that. He's
804 cool. So, anyway, AD did you enjoy your day off? I heard on the radio that
805 PSU was closed today! How did you spend your relaxing day? ABYSS, I went
806 and saw 3 Fugitives today and before it there was a preview for a movie
807 directed by James Cameron (Aliens) and it was called The Abyss. If you see
808 one movie this month go see that! It starts in 2 weeks ok? So, anyway, I'm
809 glad to see I'm still in good terms here.

829 Havn't had a chance to read either of them yet. I0alc bght a new game

858 Lasd night the power in our house went out. It would have been fine had
859 the following things not happened: I was doing the dishes at the time and
860 I had fed some scraps to the dog on the floor of the kitchen on a paper
861 plate. Well, when the lights gunt out very suddenly I was doing the
862 counters and I had been letting the water run over a pan to get it clean.
863 After the power went out, I could hear my parents and little sister and
864 older brother calling to each other "what happened", qnd the usual stuff
865 you hear when the power goes out. So I walked over to turn off the water
866 and I stepped in the food on the ground. It was some mushu pork chinese
867 stuff and it squeezed through my feet (I was barefoot). I shut off the
8680gateb and proceeded to find the rest of my family. I was walking into
869 the hall and I walked into a wall. Then my brother David (18) started
870 running around the house w/the flashlight irritating me. He was laughing
871 as I was trying to get it from him. I ran after him and I tripped on
872 the dog who was wandering around, and fell onto the edge of a table in
873 the living room where we were. I landed on my shoulder. It has been in
874 slight pain ever since last night. But then I just went to0bed0and the
875 power came on late night (11:30) my mom said this morning. If it goes
876 out tonight I will have the flashlight because I hid it under my bed.

967 VISION, in order to learn to write you must write. Just go ahead and write
968 about anything, as experience is the best teqcher. Don't worry to much about
969 wether it is good or bad, every sentence written is a lesson. (Alas I seem
970 to be slow in learning them.)
971  
972 Well, I think I'll finish the disk off if I can.
973  
974 There was long ago in a land known qc Lonslia a small cottage. It was 
975 surrounded on all sides by trees that stood over thirty feet high and were
976 green all the year round.
977  
978 Whithin the cabin lived an elderly man. Moric was the name he was most commonly
979 known by. The0elfus would come occasionally to his home and ask him questions
980 about humens and humen ways.
981  
982 Moric was happy to help them out. He had had the good fortune to be taken in
983 by an elven family when as a child he had been orphaned. The hat raysed him 
984 from the age of 9 to 18, and though it was just an instant for them (as elves
985 live to be very old.) it was a time of great importance to him.
986  
987 He had grown restless and as his 18th birthday approached. Though he loved
98( the elves and the family that had adopted him he could not get used to their
989 slow and patiant ways. Elves are very slow thinkers. Why rush when one has
990 centuries to live? is a favorite saying amoungst them.
991  
992 So he set out from the fbest clearing that had become his home to see the 
993 world. He remembered his father telling him of a large city to the north
994 east. As a parting gift the elves presented him with a beutifull loot.
995  
996 "Play it with love and it will always butub~ to you." His adopted father had 
997 told him.
998  
999 Whoops, out of space. An Astral Dreamer signing off. &*&*&*&*'s
