43 Thanks, all, for welcoming me back. I hope nobody thought I was snubbing BWMS. It's just that the other story I had kept
44 me kinda busy and I had other stuff going, too. Whatever. Anyway, let's get this thing going...

46 ACT OF MERCY
47 (Part 2 of 3)
48 by John Silverman
49  
50    Three blocks down and two blocks over in the driving rain brought him home. It was days like this he wished he still 
51 had a car. Unfortunately the only car they had dissappeared with his father a year ago. As he walked with his jacket 
52 pulled over his head, eyes glued to the pavement, he thought about work. It was more pleasent than the only other thing 
53 he could think about.
54    As he was getting ready to go, Mr. Henderson had taken him aside and said, "You know, you been doin' this for almost 
55 a year now. Straight home right after work, take care of the old lady all night, and right back first thing in the morning
56 It ain't natural. You gotta have some time for yourself. A nursing home for her would be a real good idea."
57    Tim sighed to himself, exasperated. Waht business was it of his? "Insurance won't pay for a nursing home. And I sure 
58 won't put her in one of those state homes. They're pathetic. I can't pay the bills as it is. Strokes ain't cheap, you know."
59    Henderson had a smelly old cigar butt that he like to shift from one side of his mouth to the other. "Yeah, I know. 
60 Brother in law's old lady had one, and he was up to his butt in bills. Finally hadda declare bankruptcy. Too bad your dad
61 couldn't have hung around. I know it's tough for you. But I'm gonna help. Startin' next payday, you're gettin' a five cent
62 raise." and then he grinned hugely, like the magnimonious prick he was.
63    Tim hadn't known how to contain his excitement, so he just let it all out. "Gee, thanks." He even managed something lke
64 a smile. "I really appreciate it. Hey, I gotta go. I'm needed at home."
65    "Sure, kid." Henderson had toddled back to his office to shuffle more papers and drool over the issue of Penthouse 
66 magazine he had in a desk drawer.
67    On his way out, Sherrie had caught his eye from the far register. She waved at him and he raised a hand in return. He 
68 silently raged at the unfairness of his situation and suddenly his stomach clenched like a giant fist, causing a huge 
69 ripping pain that almost doubled him over. He managed a straight face as he walked out stiffly. Outside, the horrendous 
70 pain had loosened and he stood up straight. Swell. Now he had an ulcer. This was the absolute last straw. He was going to
71 go through with it. Tonight. He felt in his pocket for the bottle. still there.
72    The memory ended just as he got to the front door. As he let himself in the house, the smell hit him. Ammonia, strong 
73 enough to corl his teeth. It did well to mask the fainter but equally unpleasent smells that usually permeated the house.
74 Smells like stale beer, moldy food, garbage... smells that he was so used to that he didn't notice them anymore. Flies 
75 buzzed thickly around something he couldn't see in the dim light. He stepped on a beer bottle and it shot out from under
76 his foot to clatter against other bottles on the floor. One shattered. A voice called out from the bedroom fearfully, 
77 "Who's there? Timmy? Is that you?"
78    "Yes, Mom." He sighed. He shrugged off his jacket and tossed it over the recliner. He stepped on, over, and though 
79 garbage on his way to the bedroom. A single lamp cast a dirty yellow light over the room. There was a four-poster bed in
80 the middle of the room. At the foot of the bed was a dresser holding an out of focus color TV with a cable box on top. The
81 carpet was rotting, partly from garbage and dirt, but mostly from spilled sewage. The source of the spillage was a portable
82 commode sitting next to the bed. Normally, the smell from it was nothing short of incredible. Now, he couldn't smell it at
83 all. In the bed itself, among the rupled and soaking sheets, lay the huge form of... Mother.
84    "You're just in time, dear. I have to go again." She said apologetically. He rolled his eyes skyward and went to help 
85 her to the commode. It wasn't easy manouvering her 300+ pounds and at one point he almost slipped and lost her. She screamed
86 Finally he had her situated on the pot and he gathered the soaking bedsheets and blankets. He carried them out to the 
87 washer. he brought back some fresh stuff and was making the bed when the phone rang. "Will you get that, honey?" she askd.
88    Tim went out to the front room and picked up the extension. "Hello?"
89    "Tim? Where's your mother?" It was his grandmother, a rather severe woman of sixty who worked as a legal secretary. She
90 had the rather infuriating habit of picking at Tim and arguing with her daughter. Tim imagined she was dissapointed in them
91 both. He didn't really blame her.
92    "She's, uh, occupied." He answered diplomatically. "Call back in about five minutes, okay?" Mother called thought the
93 door, wanting to know who it was.
94    "Well, I just called to see how she's doing. You know, you really should be taking better care of her than you do."
95    Tim held back a blistering reply and instead answered, "Yes, I know. I keep trying, though. Maybe someday I'll get it
96 right." Mother yelled again, asking who it was.
97    "Don't get sarcastic with ME, young man-"
98    "Sorry. I just had a rough day, is all." The headache was returning in full force. He had a sudden inspiration. "Say,
99 could you call me at eight o'clock? My clock's busted and there's a show on-"
100    "Okay, okay. Listen, I have to go now. Tell your mother I said hello and I'll call back later."
101    "'bye." He hung up the phone and Mother yelled for the umpteenth time who was on the phone. Tim wanted to pitch the 
102 damn thing out the window but held his temper. Today, no matter what, he would keep his cool. "It's Granma. She'll call 
103 back later." He made his way back to the bedroom. After helping Mother back to the bed, he removed the tray from the bottom
104 of the commode. On his way  to the toilet to dump it, he stepped on another bottle and almost lost his balance. Raw, warm
105 sewage sloshed all over his pants and shoes. Mother started another one of her giggling fits. He closed his eyes as his 
106 head and stomach flared up in unison.
107    "You should be more careful." Mother said, still giggling. Tim held back another nasty reply and took the tray to the 
108 bathroom. After putting it back, he went into his own room and changed. He still stunk, but he didn't care. Finally, he
109 collapsed in the recliner in the front room and switched on the TV. Mother's voice floated out from the other room, "Will
110 you fix me dinner, dear? and while you do, tell me how work went today."
111    Tim reached into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a small bottle. It was filled with a clear liquid. He studied 
112 the label, thinking. Finally, his gaze locked on the small warning sticker on the bottom. There was a tiny skull and 
113 crossbones and the words: EXTREMELY TOXIC. DO NOT INGEST.
114    He stared at the warning for a long time. Then he slipped the bottle into his pocket and went into the kitchen to fix
115 dinner.
116  
117 (To Be Concluded...)
118  
119 Whew! 
120 Patti: Good to hear from you. I thought you had dissappeared for good. Maybe we could converse on some more private board?
121 All: done. For now, anyway. See you next disk.

125   things had all happened so quickly.  i really didn't know what to think.  in
126 the last day and a half so much had happend in my life, in all our lives, that
127 my mind reeled with all the new concepts that i had not even conceived of.
128   what was happening here on the surrface to this... this place?  what had
129 happened to the piper to have caused him to be on his present state?  or the
130 state we were all in for that matter?  and what was it that i had done to aid
131 cragmore in the presence of bard's playing of the pipes?  what?  what?  what?
132   now was a time that made little sense to me.  why had we stopped our motions
133 now that we had found our missing ompanion?  my mind was elsewhere, all i had
134 heard said were the words of the piper and then some mummbling of the others.
135   i turned my head tosee the tin man dashing off to be inside the pell-mell
136 once again.  something was different.  i had not seen such an expression on
137 tin's face all during the onset of the adventure, it had changed.
138   curiouser and curiouser...  my mind demanded answers to the questions that
139 filled all of us.  and i'd be damned if i was going to just stand still now!
140   "why don't we do anything?  can't you see that even if something dastardly
141 is to happen that we've trangressed the boundry of this... this existance
142 that there still may be hope?  if we are to do anything, we must do it now.
143 and quickly at that."  i knew i was ranting again but i was wired.  i wanted
144 to get this thing over with.  the others just stood still as if i had not
145 spoken.  a turned head or two was all i saw.
146   "and what of you, you unknown person?  are you the one responsible for us
147 having crossed this cursed threshold?"  i began to close the distance between
148 the other female and myself.  "yes, that's it.  you and cragmore are both
149 resposible for my having discovered another reason for having found another
150 reason to be an outcast in society.  psionic powers?  am i to be just another
151 freak?"  i looked back at cragmore, then i went back to the other female.
152   if there was something i hadn't heard, it must have been important.  i had
153 the idea that what i was doing was right  in my mind although it may in some
154 way be wrong by all the others.
155   "no, tayree.  stop.  you don't understand the whole picture.  there are
156 other facets to be known."  it was the voice of cragmore.  "it is a gift to
157 be able to use your mind's power in a way far greater than any other normal
158 person.  but as you have guessed, it is something that must be harnessed, it
159 must be coached into the alignment with the intentions of the whole being...
160 stop, don't move.  relax and let the truth sink in."
161   something in his words made me stop to reconsider.  was my approach to the
162 other a mistake?  now i really was confused.  i now had a dislike for this one
163 other person, cragmore, but it is in his words that i must place my trust.
164 oh the dilema of my conscience.  i squeezed my eyes shut and forced these
165 thoughts out of my mind.  blankness came over me.  now i would understand.
166   what would be our next step, or would there be one.  my mind is clear.

169 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
170   The piper's mind was reeling.  Too much had happened too fast.  His long
171 sojourn here in this timeless waste had honed his perceptions to a strange
172 keeness, the overload of sexual energy, the constant presence of death and
173 destruction, the nearness of his (and his new companion's) approach to death,
174 the incredible changes that had happened in the few moments since their
175 pooled blood had seemed to rip the very fabric of the space that surrounded
176 them, the sudden appearance of the pell-mell and his companions on this
177 ill-fated adventure -- the very speed of events was causing the piper to
178 loose his grip on "reality".  Concern was on their faces as they approached.
179 Concern (for one so unworthy thought the piper, lost in guilt), and curiosity
180 for his companion, standing still before him with his bloody shirt pressed
181 to her wounded breast.  The piper raised his arm (funny how he had not noticed
182 the temperature when here alone, the presence of his co-adventurers sent
183 a chill over his naked chest and shoulders) and shouted,
184   "STOP!  For the love of all you hold sacred, do not move!"
185   The ominous flickerings of destruction and death subsided with the 
186 adventurers' stillness, questions written on their faces.  Somehow, scant
187 explanations were made, questions were deferred, or answered enough to
188 allow some functioning.  The piper was never sure just who did what -- who
189 moved the pell-mell to intercept the madly running tin man (the piper 
190 apologized for jumping to the conclusion that he had merely given way to
191 panic as the hot metal smell from the nearly overloaded batteries filled
192 the air inside the pell-mell).  Somehow, the party was removed from that
193 dread surface, insulated from causing mass death and destruction by the
194 size and mass of the pell-mell, and assembled with a breathing space to
195 consider what had happened, and what their likely fate was.
196   The lady Tayree was moving with dislike and menace in her face toward
197 the new addition to the party, standing a little apart with the piper's
198 blood soaked shirt hanging out of the top of her hastily belted gray robe.
199 The piper's arm stung where the keen blade of the knife had laid it open
200 with a deep gash, and looking down he saw blood welling out in a thick
201 stream.  He heard a deep buzzing in his ears, and darkness seemed to be
202 pressing in from the edges of his vision as he moved toward the lady
203 with whom he shared the awful guilt of this position.  The few steps
204 across the pell-mell's floor seemed to take an eternety.  He tried to put
205 an arm around her shoulders, but was that dislike on her face as she
206 pushed away from him?  Was it an accusing rejection as she slumped to
207 the floor of the vehicle, the top of her robe dropping open, releasing the
208 piper's blood-soaked garment, exposing her blood-stained chest to the
209 shocked gaze of the assembled party, who watched as she crumpled to the
210 floor, leaking away the crimson stuff of her life.  Bending, trying to
211 help, the piper felt his knees give way and all turned black.
212 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
213 OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI OMNI
214 
215         Not even the most steadfast adventurer could have kept a total grip on
216 reality in light of all that had happened. Trainor realized that the party
217 was in great peril, this time not from outside forces, but from within. He
218 surveyed the assemblage carefully, taking in all that he saw.
219         Fencer had retired to one of the Pell-mell's private rooms. Fencer was
220 a strange lot. He had barely spoken during the entire trip, yet he was always
221 present at the scene of action. Now he had detached himself from the others
222 completely. Trainor knew not what to do with him.
223         Bard was physically and emotionally drained. This was very apparent
224 from his sprawled position on one of the larger cushion seats in the far
225 corner of the commons room. His inspirational bagpipe playing had reunited
226 the group, but at a tremendous cost to others. Trainor felt that Bard
227 realized this, and was now in turmoil over his actions.
228         Emu was one of the most stable of the group. His guiding of the ship
229 and the pick-up of the people from the surface of ZEB was well executed. Emu
230 was currently at the controls of the ship, keeping watch on the sensory
231 readouts, and making sure the ship kept a stable position a few meters above
232 the surface.
233         Tin Man, the strangest of all the group save the lady found with
234 Piper, had raced to the Pell-mell's work bench to try and alleviate the
235 power surges ZEB had coursed through his body. The acrid smell of super-hot
236 connectors still permeated the air.
237         Cragmore, the psi specialist who along with Bard and Tayree had guided
238 the ship here, sat in a lotus-like position, trying to regain the strength he
239 had used so much of in entering ZEB. His confrontation with Tayree still stung
240 Trainor's ears. By showing Lady Tayree the skill she didn't know she had,
241 Cragmore had opened a real Pandora's box, and it was up to him to tender and
242 mold this new-found power in Tayree.
243         Tayree seemed to have cooled a bit, but her intense emotions towards
244 Cragmore and the mysterious companion of Piper hung in the air like a finely
245 spun web of silk. Her awakening stirred everyone greatly. This was a
246 very delicate period in her development. Cragmore would have to be responsible.
247 And Tayree, even with her feelings towards the newest passenger on board,
248 being the only other female would have to take care of her. It was a subject
249 Trainor was not looking forward to embarking on.
250         Piper, who now lay prone on the couch, was suffering from shock.
251 Trainor had covered him with electro-blankets, but all the technology and
252 medicine in the known realities could not help Piper now. He was on his own,
253 deep inside himself, and only he could break free from the delusions of his
254 shock and return to the surface of his being. Trainor had made him comfortable,
255 it was all he could do.
256         And Piper's companion, this lady from within ZEB. How did she get
257 there? What is her connection with ZEB? Is she responsible for the death and
258 destruction ZEB has wrecked across the universe? How did this strange area
259 and this strange young woman emerge from the ZEB zone and the space it was
260 borne unto from Trainor's Pell-mell?
261         There were too many questions to think about now. There were more
262 pressing matters at the moment. This lady needed help. It was time to heal
263 wounds and regroup.
264         "Tayree, I know how you might feel, but you must help me care for this
265 woman. You must put your feelings aside now and put the life of another before
266 your own. Txis was a foundation of philosophy for my people, as I suspect it
267 may be for all people. Please help her."

271 Aside to Zepher: Why don't you let us finish this adventure on our own. You can
272 always join the next one, but for the sake of this story, I would rather keep

292 where this will lead?  We all look at each other and see potential

299  
300      It was late. The few inhabitants of the inn that were left were either gathered around the fire chatting or sitting
301 alone with their drinks. All eyes turned to the door when it opened.
302      The young man that stood there looked perfectly ordinary, if a bit odd, at least as far as the untrained eye could 
303 tell. Those in the room with mystical training, though, immediately noticed something different about this man and almost
304 unconciously began to raise defenses.
305      He stood over six feet, but couldn't have weighed more than a hundred fifty pounds. A good guess would have put his
306 age between twenty and twenty five. He wore black boots, faded bluejeans, and a brown jacket of some leatherlike material
307 over a T-shirt which had a picture of a yellow 'smile' face and the words "SMILE IF YOU'RE HORNY!" under it. A blue base-
308 ball cap with the Smith & Wesson insignia completed the image. He carried no weapons openly but there was a slight 
309 suspicious bulge under the jacket on the left side. He carried a worn nylon knapsack slung over one shoulder.
310      Seeing nothing threatening or even interesting about the young man, the people went back to what they were doing. A
311 figure, sitting in a far corner, almost hidden in the shadows, watched the new arrival with keen interest.
312      Brown eyes scanned the room, taking in everything and giving nothing back in return. Then he walked over to the bar,
313 where the innkeeper was polishing some glasses. Leaning on the countertop, he commented offhand, "So, is this place 
314 always this dead?"
315      "Not usually," the inkeeper replied, bored. "Most of our more interesting clientele left on an adventure a little 
316 while back and they haven't returned yet, at least that I've heard."
317      "An adventure?" The young man nodded, "What kind of adventure?"
318      "I'm not sure. I wasn't there at the time. All I know is that some fellah named Trainor came in and announced he 
319 needed some help in saving his planet from some great danger or something like 
320 that. It's hard to know for sure because everybody you ask around here gives you a different story, and there are some great
321 tale tellers here."
322      "Yeah, I can dig that. Tell me, about how long ago did they leave and did you happen to catch the name of their des-
323 tination?" The young man tried to appear totally disinterested as he said this.
324      "They left several days ago and no, I don't know where they were headed." The innkeeper was beginning to get a tad 
325 impatient with the questioning. "I'm not here as a message service, you know. Are you going to spend some money or did you
326 just come in here to-" The young man fixed him with a stoney stare that cut him off instantly. He felt a cold sweat break
327 out and his heart began to thud sickeningly. He wished he'd kept his mouth shut.
328      After a long, tense moment, the young man grinned, breaking the spell. "With an attitude like that, I can see why
329 business is so slow lately." He pulled a coin out of his pocket and slapped it down on the counter. "I'll have a mug of 
330 whatever dishwater you serve around here. And make it a clean glass or I'll stick it in your ear." The innkeeper drew him
331 a glass of beer and the young man took it to a table near the fire but still away from company. The figure in the shadows
332 impassively watched the whole scene.
333      The young man set his pack on the floor and sat down wearily, wondering what to do next.

336 All:for those who recognize this character, this takes place APART from the story that will be running on TANIS (Assuming
337 the B-Board ever goes back up) I can't say if it takes place before or after because I'm not quite sure myself. I'll just
338 have to see as I go along.

343 Hmmm, a familiar voice heard with words of unknown flavor.  One has been able
344 to return after a long absence.  One is welcomed back aboard...
345 But it doesn't sound like the same one I heard of from before.  The old one
346 shed a light of commitment, the new one gives the image of being a wanderer
347 with a totally carefree spirit.  Carefree...  careless...  reckless?
348 
Nay, it doesn't sound like the same one at all.

361   The human body is both a terribly delicate and an incredibly tough organism.
362 In the short term, at least, it can sustain incredible damage and still keep
363 going.  However, in the longer term, it can perish from absolutely no physical
364 cause -- sheer loss of will to live.  Such is the physical vehicle that we
365 are/inhabit.  Thousands of electrical, chemical, and electro-chemical systems
366 feeding back to themselves both directly and indirectly -- the connectivity
367 of these loops nearly impossible to comprehend.
368   The piper should really be in no physical danger.  His wound, while bleeding
369 freely, was quite minor compared to that of his companion.  He had lost some
370 blood, true, but scarcely more than the typical person gives willingly when
371 asked for that contribution for another's sake.  More serious was the body's
372 unwillingness to start again the processes of life.
373   For a long (subjective as somehow the times did not fit) period, the piper's
374 body had subsisted on the life of others.  Somehow this life force had bathed
375 each cell, freeing it from the bonds of metabolism.  The collective entity 
376 that was the piper's body was rebelling against going off the dole.  Each
377 and every cell had to work again to sustain the whole, and resented the fact.
378 Groups of cells (organs) periodically would refuse to function, then start
379 again as the total life functions dropped till a critical threshold was
380 reached.  Wildly conflicting signals coursed through his body as overloaded
381 regulatory systems searched for a state of homeostasis.  Major muscle groups
382 tensed against each other, sending his body taught; he convulsed as if trying
383 to throw off unseen bonds.

397      I gazed intently at the man who entered the Inn.  He seemed to be somehow
398 familiar, and I had txe distinct impression that I had seen him onece or twice 
399 before, though I couldn't quite tell where or when...
400      Munching on an odd truffle, I noticed a large black box with a screen in
401 the back corner of the Inn.  As a approached, the machine suddenly sprang into
402 life with a horrible sound.  I jumped about 5 feet.  
403      Then suddenly, the screen flashed and bright gray (Rabbits are colorblind,

444 I sat with the Doctor and Grann in the TARDIS' food preparation center (I
445 still don't understand why the Doctor refuses to call it a kitchen), not
446 at all refreshed from my sleep.  I sipped a glass of orange juice and watched
447 the others eat.  I wasn't particularly hungry, anyway.  Something had disturbed
448 me in my sleep- but I did not know what it was.  It wasn't a cheery feeling.
449 "Whatza matter, Milch?  You seem out of sorts today," the Doctor commented
450 between bites of his rice crispies.
451 "I'm not sure.  It'll pass.  Whoa!"
452 The TARDIS lurched violently, landing at our destination.  I began reciting
453 the Clean cantrip to remove the bits of rice, and the Doctor began brushing off
454 my juice from his scarf.  Grann had been quick enough to teleport out of the
455 way of the flying food.
456 "Monitor on," the Doctor called out to the voice recognition units hidden
457 throughout the TARDIS.  The nearest screen blinked on, and provided a view of
458 the glittering forest of the Diamond valley.
459 "You walked around in THAT?"  the Doctor asked.  "One false step and you could
460 cut off a limb."
461 "It's not as bad as all that, Doctor.  Come on, let's go out and find our
462 energy source."
463 Soon, the Doctor and I were out among the sharp outcroppings of crystal.
464 Grann popped in and out, carrying a sack to put his findings in.  I studied
465 the terrain for signs of the correct mineral deposits.
466 "None to be found hereabouts, Milchar!" Grann reported energetically, popping
467 in immediately behind me.  My feet left the ground for an instant.
468 I turned around.  "Are you quite sure?"
469 "Yes.  The places such stones should be are... well, drained."
470 "Drained?  What do you mean?"
471 "The stones that are there look half-molten, but are solid as they should be.
472 Almost as if... something had sucked at them, and almost succeeded in getting
473 them."  Grann showed us a few specimens in his sack.
474 "Is the argentium all gone, then?"  I threw one of the samples in a flash of
475 despair.  It flew in a graceful arc into a nearby "tree" of crystal, and
476 shattered several "limbs" into a myriad of little shards.
477 Grann continued to report what he had seen.
478 "Er, Milch-" interrupted the Doctor.
479 "Yes?"
480 "Come look at this."  He pointed at one of the shards.
481 I carefully lifted one of the pieces, and examined it.  The branches had a
482 cellular structure much like their organic counterparts, but where the xylem
483 would have been on a plant... there were little veins of silvery material.
484 "Argentium, to be sure.  The crystal structures must use it to aid in
485 supporting the huge weight of the limbs.  By exerting power extracted from
486 the mineral, the limbs could make themselves nearly weightless.  Each "tree"
487 probably contains as much as a kilogram of the stuff-"
488 We got to work, harvesting the strange crystal plants.  After a few hours of
489 hard work (and a few dozen minor cuts and scrapes), the requisite amount of
490 argentium had been gathered.

493 CLEVER!
494 MODEM PROGRAM UPDATE-LAST
495 Mikey:Cheers here on this end. COPYLINK does work, it just requires very careful pressing of the control-break-char
496 key to activate escape sequence operations. I set the MULTI mode to off, and file transfer seems to work fine also.
497 With AMODEM and COPYLINK in the bag, I set to work on MEX. It turns out the reason it was locking up was that when
498 I replaced the Lobo Max-80 modem control instructions with LNW-80 instructions, there was a difference of one byte
499 in there somewhere, and since the code is an overlay, DB instructions must be used periodically to take up any slack
500 for each individual modem module. I adjusted the DBs to fit the memory map for the MEX overlay, it it now works fine!
501 As with COPYLINK, MEX requires very careful pressing of the escape key sequences, but it does work. So now I have
502 three modem programs for CP/M, but I will probably stick with COPYLINK most of the time. Thanks for the programs and
503 all the help you gave me.

512      And he said unto the inhabitants, where am I.  There grunts and unintelligible giggles were mysteries to him.
513 He asked again.  They responded with two-letter words and numbers that confused him yet even more. And the sky
514 turned gray.  He said unto the masses, "What kind of BBS is this?" and they responded and welcomed him into
515 the new world.  They showed him the secrets of story writing and the inner mysteries of their world, for their
516 world was Backwater Message System.  Yet in another time there is still a man who does not yet know the proper
517 way to enter such a complex world.  This very moment he is writing an appeal to them for help on learning the
518 true secrets of this other world, this completely different BBS.  He wants to participate, but he hasn't learned
519 the true valor and courage necessary to enter this world.  So this fledgeling, this seeker of wisdom and
520 adventure appeals to you now.  "Show me the way and I shall follow."  And his wounds ache.  They continue to ache

548 ZEPHYR - YOU may now have the XMODEM protocol, but BWMS doesn't, so you are 
549          still SOL.
550 +Dante-
551 
552 Zephyr: the 'h' to 'x' change is not caused by your software. It is caused 
553  your *hardware*, specificly by your modem. I used to have troubles with
554 that myself. What you need to do is take your modem in to get it serviced.
555 Tell them that the transmit level is too low.
556 It also helps to type slower. Or if you can, try writing a program that
557 sends a char, waits for BW to echo it, then sends the next char.

582      The music here is deafening.  Thump and roar passes through walls
583 without effort.  The rhythm stops for an interlude of complete chaos
584 and then back to a foced up-slide.  Tension is released as the music
585 blares its farewell.  As the music fades, voices in the hall take over
586 with shouts and drunken discussions.  The inhabitants never close the
587 doors, but leave them open for all to hear.  Loud footsteps echo through
588 the hall.  Footsteps blend with pounding on protective walls.  And the
589 clatter of alcohol moving in and amongst those outside forces laughs
590 and yet louder shouts from the hosts.  The door is as protective as the
591 walls and gives a feeling of security although it lets in the din
592 outside.  Silence pours in from the window.  The window is fully open,
593 but does better when the door is open too.  Yet the security of the door
594 will not be breached.  So the sounds continue and plumbing joins in
595 chorus.  There is a desire to go out in the hall, but the sounds are more
