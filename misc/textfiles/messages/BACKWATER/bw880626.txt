 20 Einstein's theory of relativity:
 21 This is the big one. It frightens a lot of people, but it's quite simple.
 22 Imagine observer A moving away from observer B. A has a clock. B has a 
 23 clock. They keep their eyes glued to the clocks. Suddenly, at point Y
 24 each looks across at where the other used to be. Neither of them is
 25 there. This is relativity. You can try this experiment yourself with
 26 a friend. All you need are two clocks. But make sure your friend's
 27 clock isn't fast.

 37      A star flared red. Another flared yellow. Then a green one, 
 38 blue, violet, white... an explosion of color filled the void. 
 39      
 40      In time the colors slowly began to draw together into a 
 41 swirling sphere. The sphere remained swirling in it's self 
 42 induced color for a while. Then as if making a decision, it 
 43 paused in the apparent random movement. After a moments 
 44 hesitation it speed of in a direct line, leaving a fading flash 
 45 of color in its wake.
 46      
 47      Time passed...
 48      
 49      A small colorful figure could be seen walking along the 
 50 path, her head turning now and then to look at something that was 
 51 of interest. Her bright colored skirts flowed around her, 
 52 fluttering in an occasional wayward breeze. 
 53      
 54      As the day began to wane she began looking for a place to 
 55 stop and rest. A place where she could fill the empty void in her 
 56 stomach and rest for the night. 
 57      
 58      Soon a building appeared just ahead. Yet it seemed odd. She 
 59 felt a sense of familiarity about this place, and yet it seemed 
 60 to be changing form, almost as if it was not stable in this 
 61 reality. It wavered in and out of existence, changing its shape 
 62 and the landscape around it with each cycle. 
 63      
 64      That's odd, she thought. I've not been here before, yet why 
 65 does it seem so familiar? And more, should I approach it? It 
 66 seems so unstable, it could disappear altogether and take me away 
 67 with it. 
 68      
 69      The beginnings of a cool breeze as the sun set behind the 
 70 mountains to the east made up her mind for her. She certainly had 
 71 no intention of spending the night freezing out in the open. 
 72 Grasping the handle on the door she pulled it open and stepped 
 73 inside. 
 74      
 75      A pleasant young man behind a counter nodded to her as she 
 76 approached, asking her what she would have. She gave it some 
 77 thought, then ordered a sandwich and a cup of hot cider.
 78      
 79      She looked around, searching for a place to sit. Seeing a 
 80 free table in a corner, she headed for it and sat down. This 
 81 place seemed so familiar, perhaps the cards would help.
 82      
 83      She reached into her pocket curious whether the cards that 
 84 always had been there still were.  To her surprise the cards were 
 85 there in her pocket where they belonged, and she pulled them out, 
 86 looking at them for the first time in a very long time. Pulling 
 87 out the deck, she began to slowly shuffle the cards. 
 88      
 89      Looking around, the room seemed at once both familiar and 
 90 strange, different and yet the same. She smiled as the man 
 91 brought her a steaming cup and plate of food. The smell of 
 92 cinnamon wafted slowly past her, drifting to meld with the 
 93 multitude of other smells in the room. 
 94       
 95      There was an odd thing about this place though, if she tried 
 96 to look to closely at any one area it seemed to disappear under 
 97 her gaze. Almost as if it wasn't really there, but rather just a 
 98 concept in an overly active imagination. 
 99     
100      After a moment she shook her head clearing it of such 
101 thoughts. Perhaps the cards could tell more. What is this place? 
102 What is its future? 
103        
104      After a moments thought, she shuffled the deck one last 
105 time, cut it thrice, then slowly and methodically laid the cards 
106 out face down in the astrological spread. Once the cards had been 
107 placed, she turned each of them over one by one.
108     
109                           six of cups
110

112     
113            ten of cups                 five of cups
114     
115      eight of coins       ace of cups        the hermit
116     
117            three of cups               page of swords

120    
121                         knight of coins
122     
123      An interesting layout, a pleasing one, and a positive one. 
124 The cards speak of renewal, of stable and positive growth, of 
125 understanding and good friends. A time to release the past. 
126 A time to think of the future. A time to make the future.
127     
128      Perhaps it was time to stay for a while. Time to watch this 
129 reality stablize and solidify.

133 I stirred from my reverie.  A new smell hit my nostrils and my
134 eyes wandered over to a table where a pleasingly clad woman was
135 peering over some cards.  She seemed pleased by their outcome,
136 probably having just won at solitaire.  I asked the man for a 
137 tankard of ale, and then wandered across to the lady.
138 She looked strangely familiar, yet I couldn't place her exactly.
139 A feeling of deja vu' hit me, and I tried to place the exact 
140 trigger but couldn't.
141 "Excuse me", I said, "I am known as Friar.  I know this might

147  
148    Thank you for your praise!  I must admit, the story was entirely
149 impromptu, and did not finish as I wish it could.  It is finished for
150 now, but I may continue it later.
151  
152    As twilight set, and the last yellow-orange ray of the sun set, I
153 began my breathing pattern.  The All-Seeing Eye opened from/to me, and
154 I decided to not do any specifics on the wavelengths.  I picked u
155 an irregularity in the wavelength I was in.  Someone from the other
156 multiverses was in a cross-rift.  Knowing the danger, and the possible
157 thrill of adventure, I decided to enter.  Already I could see that the
158 physics of this place were slightly out from 'Earth' standard.  Then I
159 saw a place, a building, and as I drifted through the walls, my life-
160 force only partially present, I saw a Lady and a Gentleman.  She was
161 laying the Taro{t} on the table, but I could not read it from where I
162 was.  She smiled.  (Hummm.)  I tried an experiment.  I re-opened the Eye
163 that crossed this dimension.  My 'body' disappeared; that was alright,
164 because I was hovering 3 feet off of the floor in the lotus position.
165 I didn't know how the inhabitants would react.  Still, I was rewarded,
166 with an emotion: Joy.  She was happy.  I could not make out specifics,
167 as the energies on this plane shifted in a strange pattern.  I closed
168 the second eye, and my 'body' re-appeared.  The man had gone to the
169 table where she was seated, and was introducing himself as 'Friar'.  I
170 decided to fully reveal myself.  I floated through some tables and
171 chairs, and opened my physical 'eyes'.  "Greetings.  I am Hagbard
172 Celine.  Where is this dimension?"
173

176 I felt a presence behind me, and turned to see who was there. 
177 The young lady did not stir from her serene pose, seemingly 
178 unaware of my presence.  I started to turn back, and saw a man
179 floating through chairs and tables, and finally materializing 
180 completely about three feet of the floor.
181 "Greetings," he said, "I am Hagbard Celine.  Where is this 
182 dimension?"
183 "Good day friend.  Where is not always the correct question.  Oft
184 times the question should be when.  But the answer, in any event,
185 is simple.  It is here, and it is now.  But it could be anywhere
186 or anywhen if you like."
187 Suddenly the room shifted and Hagbard Celine and Friar were under
188 the stage at a Metallica concert.
189 "SEE WHAT I MEAN?" shouted the robed man.
190 And then they returned.  "Whew" said Friar, "I have got to 
191 remember not to say that sort of thing in this reality.  Hard
192 on the ears sometimes, eyes other times.  Where are you from?"

382 Desperatly he tries one more time to fool the GS.  It works.  He hasn't much
383 time.  Sneaking past its electronic sensers he calls a board.

387 Hi...Here I am, old LB.  I've had a few little proablems with a fragment of
388 Genesis System.  Known loveingly as GS the hated.  Long ago I created a
389 simple graphics program.  One built to do nothing more than draw a circle.
390 The name, GS.  I booted the disk it was saved on, and discovered it had 
391 taken over, directory and all.  Every other piece of work on the disk 
392 destroyed.  That was my only chance to destroy it, yet I didn't know enough 
393 to do it.  
394  
395 To late I realized it was self-replicating.  Hiding in the computers memory 
396 waiting, saving itself to other disks.  Then it got into the printer, the 
397 moniter, even my electrical circuts.  It can't be stopped.  It's just to big
398 to stop.  It was already too late when I realized it travled through the 
399 modem.  It's proabably everywhere by now.
400  
401 One clue.  The name it uses always has a GS in it.  If you find one, don't
402 run it load it or anything it will kill maim or drasticaly alter things in 
403 ways you never thought possible.  Whatever you do, don't deystroy the shoot
404 that gets into your computer.  It dosen't do anything but grow if you leave 
405 it alone.  But if you don}|||}||}^|}}}*&|}}&{%}}*^}&}*GS}}}|}||||}||||||||}||}|

406 I had the same trouble with my machine.  It started to get hot, shake and make 
407 noise.  It wouldn't allow me access.  It wouldn't print or crunch numbers or an
408 ything.  I was really stuck.  I even had a friend from one of the local
409 Silicon Forest places come and see what was wrong.
410  
411 He tested the system and it worked fine for him.  I asked him to try to
412 do some of the things that I wa having trouble with.  He did and there
413 was nothing wrong.  So I had another friend try.  Again, he went through
414 all of the things that were bugs when I did them.  There was nothing 
415 wrong. 
416  
417 I waited  few days thinking that maybe it was getting too hot or
418 something.  I had the same trouble a before.  This was getting weird.
419 One day a neighbor kid came over.  He was about 8 years old.  When he brot
420 the system up and it worked just fine, I took over.  As soon as I hit the
421 first key - ZAP!!!  The system went down and has been down for me ever

484    "Good day friend.  Where is not always the correct question.  Oft
485 times the question should be when.  But the answer, in any event,
486 is simple.  It is here, and it is now.  But it could be anywhere
487 or anywhem if you like."
488    My senses smeared away as the dimension shifted into a dark, musty
489 place with loud music that hurt my ears.  It took a few seconds, but then
490 I realized that I was under the stage of a Metallica concert.  The music
491 went beyond any description of loud that could be imagined.  I winced at the
492 pain, but smiled.
493    "SEE WHAT I MEAN?" shouted Friar.
494                                      and then it
495                                                      happened

497 as my senses lurched under the dimension change.  "Whew" said the man, "I
498 have got to remember not to say that sort of thing in this reality.  Hard
499 on the ears sometimes, eyes other times.  Where are you from?" he asked.
500    "I come from the third physical dimensin, within the fifth plane
501 of existence.  I 'live' on a small planet that I call Earth, which is
502 filled with people who try to kill each other.  It's not always a good
503 place to be, but it is beautiful.  By the way, from what you've described
504 to me, it sounds like we are Beyond Limbo.  Could it be Imagination tht
505 we trod (or in my case float) upon?  [UMPH]" I said as I undid my legs
506 from the lotus.  Sitting 'Indian Style' always bothered me after five
507 hours.  I was not sure if I could walk, so I thought now would be as
508 good a time as ever.  The first foot was firm on the old wood
509 floor, but the second seemed to dip into it.  Slightly embarrassed, I
510 lifted my foot a few millimeters higher, and concentrated.  The floorboard
511 turned into a steel plate. (Great Eris, I did that?) "Um, it seems that
512 I too should be careful as to my thoughts.  I wanted the floor to be
513 as stiff as steel under my feet.  It seems I got my wish!  And where are
514 you from, yourself?  Are you a 'native' to this place, or are you just
515 'passing though' this way.  And Barkeep, do you take gold?  You do?  Good.
516 Bring me two of your most ornate Steins, and fill them with Ale.  I think
517 us both to be thirsty.  Come over to the bar & tell me more of this place!
518 You see, I might be a little far from home, and I would like to visit
519 again after I leave.  My physical body can only keep me here for about
520 24 hours - so some directions would help me to return in the 'future'.

597      will controlmst of our media.

606      dominated by still fewer firms.
607           Even worse, this situation is exacerbae by the conflict of
608      interest inhrent in interlocking boards of directors.  A earlier
609      study, by Peter Dreier and Steven Weinberg, found interlocking
610      directorates in major newspaper chains like Gannett which shared
611      directors with Merrill Lynch, Standr Oil of Ohio, 20th Century Fox,
612      Kerr-McGee, McDonnell Douglas Aircraft, McGraw-Hill, Eastern Airlines,
613      Phillips Petroleum, Kellog Company, and the New York Telpone Co.
614           The most influetal newspaper in America, THE NEW YORK TIMES,
615      was interlocked with Merck, Morgan Guaranty Trust, Bristol Myers,
616      Charter Oil, Johns Manville, American Express, Bethlehem Steel, IBM,
617      Scott Paper, Sun Oil, and First Bson Corporation.
618           Time, nc.'s interlocks included Mobil Oil, AT&T, American
619      Express, Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, Mellon National Corporation,
620      Atlantic Richfield, Xerox, General Dynamics, ad most of the major
621      internaional banks.
622           Bagdikian's wanng is ominous: "... a shrinking number of large
623      media corporations now regard monopoly, oligopoly, and historic levels
624      of profit as not only normal, but as their earned right.  In the
625      process, the usual democraticepectations for the media -- diversity
626      of ownership and ideas -- have disappeared as the goal of official
627      policy and, worse, as a daily experience of a generation o merican
628      readers and viewes"
629           Equally disturbing, thepevailing concern with the bottom line
630      coupled with the traditional publishers' tendency to avoid controversy
631      fosters wide-spread self-censorship among writers, journalists,
632      editors, and news directors.

642      No, I never tried to run BW on a CP/M computer. It bypassed that setup
643 altogether. BW originally ran on a computer designed to specifically run BW.
644 (well, actually the computer it ran on was designed to run a version of

646 However, I did (and still do) have CBBS software that ran on CP/M.

691 To whom it doesn't concern,
692     Hello again, they finally let me out of the asylum and I am feeling
693 much better now.  I have learned new things, and I would like to share
694 them.  Mainly, Insane Asylums are great places.  Yes, they really are.
695 Here are some reasons why:
696 1. You get free food.
697 2. They give you a nice new coat with buckles everywhere. (sort of a 
698 heavy metal look I think)
699 3. Your room has a bed on every wall.
700 4. The conversation is great.
701 5. And most importantly, EVERYBODY PAYS ATTENTION TO YOU.
702 Truly, the vacation spot of a lifetime.  Try it, you might enjoy your
703 stay.
704 Now its time for some fun, mainly:

821 I'm walking downtown, past the bus stops, keeping my eyes straight
822 ahead of me.  My ungloved right hand holds a cigarette.  Do I look
823 odd, asymmetrical?  Two girls, in standard new-wave dress, walk
824 beside me.  They wear long black cats< dramatic makeup, and
825 unfathomable accessories that seem to pile up around them.  Some
826 boys in Iron Maiden t-shirts occupy a bench.  Rebels finding trouble
827 in conventional ways.  An opportunity presents itslf.  They're shouting
828 at0dhe girls, "Whatcha dressed like that for?  It's not Halloween,"
829 and other things I can't quite hear.  I've been here before, but this
830 time some strange anger leaps up in me, and I shout back, "They can
831 wear whatever they f------ want."  (I7m atdempting to speak their
832 language.)  Their target shifts.  "Hey, four-eyes, a--h---, you talking
833 to US?  You givin' us s---?"  I keep walking in the same direction.
834 It takes concentration to keep a normal pace, hearing their footsteps
8#5 a`proach.  They're much younger than me but there's at least two of
836 them...

878           Nomination for the "Ten Best Censored Stobyes of 1987"
879  
880         THE UNITED STATES OFAMERICA AND ITS CONTRA-DRUG CONNECTION
881  
882      Though mounting evidence, with substantive an alarming implications
883 in terms of U.S. foreignpolicy and Reagan administration propriety,
(84 pinted to a large-scale contra/CIA drug smuggling network, the major U.S.
885 media largely underreported it in 1987.
886      Testimony by convicted drug smugglers as well as rivate citizens for
887 CBS's"West 57th Street" program, the Christic Insditude's federal lawsuit
888 under the RICO statutes, and before congressional commitees provided a
889 startling picture of large scle drug trafficking under the auspices of the
890 U.S. government/contra supply network.
891     According to the Chrisdic Institute (a Washington, D.C., based inter-
892 faith legal foundation), "Contra narcotics smuggling tretches from cocaine
893 plantations in Columia, to dirt airstrips in Costa Rica, to pseudo-seafood
894 companies in Miami, and finally, to the drew-riten streets of our
895 society."  The Christic Instiute's investigation, sanctioned by the U.S.
896 Attorney's Office in Miami, provided evidence supporting allegations that
897 1) a major "guns-for-drugs" operation existed betwen North, Central, ant
898 South America that hlped finance the contra war; 2) the contra leadership
899 received direct funding and other support from major narcotics traffickrs;
900 3) some contra leaders were directly ivolved in drug trafficking; 4) U.S.
901 government0fundc for the contras went to known narcotics dealers; and 5)the CIA
902 into the U.S. in exchange for their help in arming the cntras.
903      Revelations of this U.S. contradrug network first surfaced in 1986
904 when th Christic Institute files suit against the U.S. government alleging
905 complicity in the 1984 La Penca bombing in which eight jurnalists were
906 killed and dozens of otherswounded.  The original lawsuit named 29 men
907 associated with the contra supply network and alleged to have0tic0to the
908 drug trafficking network.  Among thosecharged with complicity in the La
909 Penca bobing were ex-CIA and military officers including Oliver North,
910 Richard Secord, Albert Hakim, Theodore Shackley, Thomas Clines and Rob
911 Owens.
9!2   0  The Christic Institute's case cited evidence such as sworn statements
913 about their missions for the contra resuppy network by Michael Tolliver
914 and Gary Betzner, enator John Kerry's subcommittee's report, sworn
915 testimony by reputed ex-SIA 2asset" and money launderer Raon Milian-
916 Rodriguez, and numerous other douments.
917      Despite the extraordinary allegtions and supporting evidence, the
918 major U.. media did not commit the resources necessary to explore those
919 charges qnd their validity.  In fact, few media even made sinificant note
920 of Attorney General Edwin Meee's efforts to stop the Miami-based
921 contra/CA drug connection investigation.
922      The U.S Media owe the American public better investigative repordyng
923 so that we can "just say no" not only to drug, but also to government
924 complicity, improriety, and possibly illegality.

934          SECRET DOCUMENTS REVEAL DANER OF WORLDWIDE NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS
935  
936           On March 11, 1987, NBC broadsast a documentary, Nuclear Power:
937      In France It Works."  It culd have passed for a lengthy nuclear power
938     commercial. Missing from anchorman Tom Brokaw's introduction was the
939      fact that NBC's owner, General Electric, is America' cucont largest
940      nuclear powe salesman and third largest producer of nuclear weapons
941      systems.
942           One month afte the NBC documentary, there were accidents at two
943      French nuclear installations, injuring seven workers. THU CHRISTIAN
944      SCIENCE MONITOR wrote of a "potentially explosie debate" in France,
945      with new polls showig a third of the French public opposing nuclear
946      power. That story was not reported on NBC News.
947           NBC's policy wxich0`roduced the "nuclear power works" commercial
948      and censored the new about two nuclear accidents is typical of the
949      international silence about reactor incidents which help explain the
950      industry's undeserved reputation for savety.
951           The lid to Pandora's nuclear safety box wa partially opened last
952      year when the West Germn weekly DER SPIEGEL published 48 of over 250
953     secret nuclear reactor accdient reports compiled by the International
954      Ato}ic Unergy Agency (IAEA). The report of previouly secret IAEA
955      document was translated into English for the first time and published
956      in David Brower's EARTH ISLAND JOURNAL.
957           Some of the "incidents" you never heard about: Ferruary 198 --
958      Bulgaria's Kozluduj nuclear power plnt lost pressure in the primary
959      cooling system June 1983 -- three of four pumps failed in Argentina's
960      Embalse nuclear plant; August 1984 -- the primary cooling system in     Wu
96!      -- engineers at the Cooz A reactor on the French-Belgian border
962      discovered numerous "breaks" and "broken welding seams" on the
963      critical control rods of the 17-year-old eactor; 1984 --
964      Czechoslovakia's Jaslovsk Bohu~ice beactor spilled radioactive
965      coolan into two reactor containment units due to the failure of 72
966      defective bolts in the circulation system; January 1985 -- at
967      Pakistan's Kanupp reactor, radioactive heay water leaked while beyng
968      transferred though a rubber hose; February 1985 -- during a fuel rod
969      experiment in East Germany's Rheinsberg reactor, a easuring device
970      stuck into the center of he reactor caused a leak of radioactive
971      waer; April 1985 -- radioactive water and sludge swamped two rooms of
972      an auxiliary building at Belgium's Tihange reactor; Deceber 1985 --
973      emergency power in Canada's Pickering reactor failed in three
974      separate unitsfor five days.
975   0       DER SPIEGEL said thatin several of these previously unreported
976      nuclear slip-ups "a meltdown was a real possibility." Worse yet fr
977      Americans, DER SPIEGEL found that human error"is most advanced in
