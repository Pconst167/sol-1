47 The Poet paused in his departure for a moment to speak to the disoriented stranger.
48 "Sir, I am afraid that we poor primitive aborigines cannot comprehend,
49 let alone answer your questions. Perhaps the Wizard could. If you'd like to see him just join us in following
50 that baked-clay path over there. It used to reflect at a different wavelength before the apprentice got here. 
51 It seems a sort of blue-green, fading off into the ultraviolet, now.
52 Oh, by the way, high-technology weapons are frowned upon here. Piper, could you help our new friend here to 
53 avoid undue trouble with the authorities? Perhaps you could replace those unsightly turrets with some nice flower
54 arrangements until he takes off again."

57 Question: last night when I got on here, DA (now DB) was full, right
58 up to line 629 (so I kinda squeezed my comment in on someones border-
59 sorry 'bout that!)
60 Now I log on and discover that what was line 629 is now 619, and there
61 are 10 new lines.  If I had known about this capability, I would
62 have used it, rather than defacing someones border.
63 So---how was this done (or is it a SYSOP trick?)
64 Aside: since some of the characters' patron is going to be absent
65 for the next week (real time {whatever that is, when one is speaking
66 from the INN}) do you suppose the remaining players could try to
67 avoid terminating those defenseless characters? Hardly sporting, you know.

70 voyeur: turn the line numbering on (nu y) and move to a blank line.  tell it
71 del then y when it types the line for you and asks "delete?"  Mikey's magic
72 blackboard pulls together when you erase a line from it.  I'd be glad to pipe
73 your two characters off into some form of stasis if you would tell me who to
74 freeze.  (You'll have to remind me to get them back or work out another return)
75 -------------------------- (ahhh! the luxury of a fresh dosisk!!))-------------
76   The piper regarded the being who was asking the strange questions for a time.
77 Was the apprentice hallucinating again?  Oh well, no use taking chances, and
78 he was not going to leave the apprentice laying here in the grass without 
79 anyone watching closely.  The piper lifted the pipes back onto his shoulder,
80 puffed the bag full, struck the bag to start the drones and began to draw notes
81 from the chanter.  Hearing a slight discordant beat, he stopped up one tenor
82 drone and the basse drone.  The center drone reed was almost gone.  Oh well,
83 he adjusted the drone to the best tone it could produce then restarted the
84 others.  Looking at the strange visitor, the piper saw him seemingly entranced.
85 On a whim, the piper began a jig.  With the strains of "Paddy's Leather 
86 Breeches"  the visitor's clothing began to change.  The silvery suit began to
87 darken, roughen, and grow fringes.  Withing a very few minutes the visitor was
88 dressed in a set of fringed buckskin clothing complete with a coonskin cap.  
89 His impressive vehicle was changing also.  Near the end of the song, the silver
90 vehicle had become larger and more earthy,  the sides had become log wa;lls and
91 the gun turret had become a chimney with a wisp of smoke floating out.  Was
92 that a look of panic in the visitors eyes as a solidly-built woman wearing
93 a flour-covered apron came to the door of the log cabin and called to the
94 visitor, "Samuel, quit talking to those good-for-nothing ruffians and come
95 inside!  Your dinner is getting cold."
96 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
97 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
98     I don't know who he is, but I'm certainly glad we have
99 another visitor. I was tired of being treated like public enemy
100 number one. Taking advantage of my sudden depopularization, I decided
101 it was time to get something from the bar.  "Barkeeep!"

109      She drifted in among the group with a smile curling like a stray
110 wispy lock, and a ripple spread in reaction.  With a flourished
111 curtsey and a blush, she honoured the piper's greeting, but when the 
112 words of the Bard's bawdy song reached her ears, she stiffened, dashing
113 him one chill look and then brushing past him, declining to speak.  

114 Raising an eyebrow at the flustered 'Commander' who was fingering his
115 garments in disbelief, she chuckled quietly when she met the eyes of the
116 befloured woman, who merely rolled her eyes and flounced into the cabin.
117 
She espied the apprentice prone on a fantastic matte of colour, so weaved
118 through the milling crowd, nodding at several of the Inn's old-timers,
119 but could not resist responding to the quizzical look of one Inngoer as
120 she passed by; with voice melodic, she addressed him:  "Traveller Geo,
121 I am the lady of dragons, come on whispering winds.  Whence come you, and
122 why doth you change your name?"  
Stepping past him, she knelt by the
123 apprentice, swiftly bringing out a small flask with a soft gold sheen,
124 and tenderly tipping his head forward, she administered the liquid.

128 I am so busy making sure that I get the words right that I don't "listen" to the
129 verses!
130 As I try not to edit songs (except to reconcile different versions), I 
131 probably shouldn't have "sung" that one at all.
132 Once again, I offer my apology.

137 Turning Freddie over to TMA for safekeeping, the bard turned towards the 
138 stranger. Reaching into his pouch he shuffled through a number of cards.
139 They appeared to be made of some hard, shiny material. Finding the right one, he
140 replaced the others in his pouch.
141 Flashing it at the commander, he spoke. "Commander, consider yourself
142 lucky. Let me give you a short list of the charges we could file. Landing in a
143 restricted area, willful avoidance of customs and quarantine, failure to land at
144 a proper immigration point with official clearance, suspicion of smuggling, and 
145 bearing arms without proper authority. Of course there are other matters such as
146 threatening an officer with a deadly weapon, & your pilot's certificate & the 
147 ship's regristration papers......."
148 The commander looked at the bard in shock. He opened his mouth, as if 
149 to speak & then closed it again.
150 The bard continued, "Now, perhaps we can discuss this a bit more civily?"
151 He steered the commander toward the others, who by this time were regarding
152 the bard rather quizzically themselves. As soon as the commander's back was 
153 turned, Kenin caught the piper's eye & winked!
154 #I never *said* that I was an officer, nor did I say what kind, now
155 did I? These types always run in the same pattern.#
156 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
157 The apprentice awoke to find himself supported by d's arms as she removed
158 a flask from his lips.
159 "Milady, this is not seemly! On your knees -- to ME?!", he objected. 
160 "I thank thee for rousing me, but I am not worthy of thy notice. After all, I am
161 but an apprentice."
162 He stopped as d gave him a stern look which turned into laughter. He continued 
163 (far less formally!) "Milady, what WAS that potion thou gavest me?"
164 ................................the apprentice..................................
165 Voyeur:I must correct piper, it is a sysop trick. Del will remove the line but 
166 not move any lines.
167 On another subject, I fear your are mistaken! The two of whom you speak are
168 going to be here every day (barring accidents!).

172 Dear Leroy;
173      As to your terms...  I'll accept the task of helping Salazar retrieve
174 the Egg.  I've always had a soft spot for him, even if he is a whiner.
175 Also see what I can do with Fast Fred.  Unfortunately, I have a feeling
176 he's in no position to buy anything right now.  As for stealing the
177 piper's pipes, my mama didn't raise no fool.  In other words, I'm not
178 going to tangle with that bunch, sorry.
179      Finally, no I don't have Pam.  It's an interesting idea though.  If
180 I happen to run across her, I'll snatch her.  The Backwater bunch would pay
181 a fortune to get her back.   Hmmm... I wonder where she's gotten to, anyway.
182                                           Cheerfully yours,
183                                           Mohammed Wassir

187      God, my poison oak itched.  The pain shivered up and down my legs like
188 an electric current.  Sleep eluded me.  Finally, I walked stiff-legged into
189 the bathroom and took that little green pill Serena had given me...  Sleep
190 came in a rush.
191 
192 A dream...
193 
194      I'm running down a long corridor--the walls are vomit green.  I hear
195 the patter of feet behind me.  The men in the tacky bathrobes are chasing 
196 me.  I think they want to shave my head.  I reach for my .44 -- she's not
197 there.  Christ, I've been running forever.  The sweat trickles down my
198 face.  The saline droplets sting my eyes. Got to get way.  Lungs ache....
199      A door!  I stop.  Open it.  A Victorian boudoir   Red and Black...
200 Sexy... I go in... The door shuts behind me.  It locks.  I wander through
201 the room, touching objects -- Finally getting my breath back.  Sense 
202 someone behind me... I turn.  A beautiful woman stands before me... 
203 Shimmering in silk -- her dress shows more than it conceals... She moves
204 to me.  We kiss, slowly... I taste her sweet breath...  She pushes me
205 down on some cushions.  Her voice is like a clear bell...
206      "Don't worry, they can't get you now... My name is Pam."
207 She slowly starts of unbutton her dress...
208       <Brrrrrring>...          <Brrrrring>
209      Now what's a telephone doing in my dream.  I want it to stop.  Only
210 it isn't a dream anymore.  I struggle to wakefullness, and stab at the
211 telephone on my nightstand.
212      "Yeah, what do you want?"
213      "Salazar?  It's Wassir."
214      I'm wide awake now.
215      "Mohammed, what can I do for you?"
216      "McKane's back on the prowl.  Watch your step.  I hear you're looking
217 for the Egg."
218       "Yeah, either the Egg or Cornielius Hutton, whichever comes first."
219       "You and a hundred other people... some heavy dudes are involved in
220 this one.  Listen Salazar, meet me at the 'Dew Droppe Inn' tomorrow at
221 4 o'clock.  I might have a deal for you."
222       "O.K., see you tomorrow."
223       <Click>
224       I quickly roll over and try to find that Victorian boudoir again.
225 No luck.  Sleep comes, but my dreams elude me.

227 
228      Don't you think there's too much sex and violence in the Backwater?
229 Pam, you'd better come back to defend yourself.  You may end up in an
230 adventure whether you want to or not.  Also rumor has it that  one of the
231 chaps here has printouts of some of your previous submissions.  He might
232 post selected portions.  Maybe he should call it:  "THE BEST OF PAM"

238   Thanking the bartender for my ale, I turned my attention to my
239 caretaker.  "Actually, if you're looking for the suppleier of 
240 my Bolo's, you better get help." My voice suddenly decreased in
241 volume when I saw I had his attention. "That whatever-he-is over there
242 is looking for the same people you are, but I don't think either will
243 have much luck without big, BIG help." I stopped long enough to drain
244 my glass.  If you want to stop McDonald, you better find that wizard
245 fellow you were talking about, fast."
246     He looked at me strangly, "why do you tell me this now?" he asked.
247     "The Bolos were on consignment, now that you and your friends have
248 sent them to God knows where, my life expectancy has been greatly
249 reduced. And if he comes for me here, I doubt he'll stop at just
250 me."  I ordered another round and waited to see the outcome of the
251 Bard's escapade.

258       --Wait a minute! Cars can't talk!--

294 pursuits, as befits my simplicity I came upon a hardware peddlar who
295 proffered me a potion, quaffing which I found it to be a key, a number
296 to an unexpected Land Of BackWater, a 'scape of shifting realities.
297 Be somewhat slab-sided, I momentarily stumbled in my disorientation
298 and came to fear that the habitues of the Inn would think me a bumb-

300 methinks, 'twould be more discreet for now to bide my while, lest I

309 The Poet turned from Geezer with a sigh and stepped from his dream. As 
310 tired as he was, it was the only way he could find the Inn. Fortunately,
311 it was located in several of his better dream worlds. But it was quite 
312 inconvienient having to drop off to sleep every time someone new wanted

337    The piper, not normally telephathic,  was extrememly startled when he
338 "heard" a plea for help from the ninja.  He glanced around then understandin
339 slowly dawned.  He finished the tune that was going, then smoothly seged
340 into "Clyde Side".  This was a pretty problem -- extract the ninja without
341 damage to the BOLO disguised as a VW.
342   He wandered close to the bridge and let reality slip slightly.  Couldn't
343 that stream be a little larger?  As a river, it was rather small, it really
344 needs more -- authority.  Isn't that a power boat racing upstream?  A 
345 sentient power boat, deprived of any remote effectors... #sorry BOLO, we'll
346 change you back very soon#  ... the boat is stopping, an orange rubber raft
347 is thrown out and a cloaked figure is climbing into it ... the boat is 
348 fading #goodbye BOLO# ... this river is really too much .... this stream is
349 really too wide, and doesn't match the bridge .... ahh -- that fits.
350   The piper looked down into the bed of the small stream.  Seated within
351 an orange life-raft that more than filled the bed of the little stream,
352 the ninja was plying the oars.  Stopping the pipes, the piper called down,
353 "If you've had enough exercise, I think I can find you a drink up here."
354 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
355 The apprentice turned to the one called "Traveller", "Milord, that was
356 the problem. I had to use a 'reality pill' which is VERY technological!"
357 Turning now to the Man in Gray, "It is all right, my friend, those 
358 colors are really there."

370 Do you expect me to believe the Albanians top agent is afraid 
371 to steal a bagbipe from a bunch of thugs from Portland (sticks 
372 city) Oregon? Give me a break. What are you up to Mohammed? It 
373 smells fishy, if you know what I mean.
374 
375 Why the phone call to Salazar? You knew I had his phone tapped.
376 What kind of games are you playing? Are you really the amateur,
377 the fool, that you're pretending? Or do you have something up 
378 your sleeve I should know about?
379 
380 So let's stop playing games. I want those pipes, I want to 
381 know what you're up to, and want you to stop screwing around.
382 
383 I'm giving you another chance. Here's your next assignment. I
384 I've got Corneilius Hutton. I'll trade her for either PAM or 
385 the egg. Arrange it.

393 Dear Ronald:

395 Negotiations to resupply Fast Fred with new Bolos has broken

398 
399 I'd like to remind you that your losses at Fast Freddies are 
400 inconsequential in comparision to your overall business with 
401 McKane Enterprises. Back off on Fred if you wish to continue
402 to do business with us. I will compensate you for your loss.

430 Leroy;
431      Sorry you are upset with me.  But as the old Chinese proverb goes:
432 'That's the way the fortune cookie crumbles'.  But maybe we can do business,
433 then again maybe not.
434      First Cornelius Hutton is male... not a 'she'.  Somehow, Leroy, I have
435 doubts as to whether you really have him.  In any case I don't want him.
436 If I locate either the Egg or Pam, you'll have to come up with cold hard
437 cash for either one.  I think Salazar might be willing to cut a deal for
438 Hutton, but I have an idea he would get much more satisfaction from blowing
439 you away.  As long as you play straight with me, I won't tell him you're
440 involved.
441       As for the piper's pipes, there still is no deal.  I have no desire to
442 have a purple nose and polka-dot tush.  If I stumble across them, I'll
443 snatch them; otherwise, forget it.
444      I would appreciate any information on the location of either the Wizard
445 or Pam.  Hope this clears up any understanding.
446                                               Mohammed Wassir

448 P.S.  I'll let the slurs about being a crummy terrorist pass for now.  If
449 you repeat them, I may make *YOU* my next assignment!

464 When he awoke, the Poet was glad to see that Freddy was still where 
465 he'd left him. Hypnotizing him into thinking he was in the Inn was a 
466 more effective method than he could have hoped for. In a reality with as
467 much slack as this one it had its drawbacks, however, as was evidenced
468 by the erstwhile Bolo huckster's incapacatating inebriation and the pile
469 of empty ale mugs around his feet. Oh, well... at least he wasn't trying
470 to run away...

486 Getting up slowly from the pink grass the man in gray shook his head and
487 wondered "how do I get back to the inn" he thought foor a while and

491 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
492 alright, alright already!!!!  at first glance I thought you people to be
493 too primitive too converse on an equil level. most low-tech societys only 
494 understand volence. I see that I am now mistaken. I did want some period
495 clothes but I don't think these fit the bill(he said,looking down at his new
496 threds). I may have been a little pushy at first but I assure you I had all 
497 the necessary papers in my ship. I don't think the papers are in the cabin
498 however. I see now that I need your help to catch McDonald. I will follow 
499 you to the Wizard if he can help me.
500 Piper:I appreciate your need for safety,but after I am done, could I have 
501 my ship back?!? the clothes I can use for a museum. please do this for me!

522     This is just a guess, but are you by any chance calling from an

542   The piper lifted his pipes to his shoulder and played the first five bars of
543 "The Black Bear's Hornpipe", then stopped abruptly.  
In the ensuing silence,
544 he called out, "If anybody want's to head back to the inn and sit the rest of
545 this out, better move now.  I'll pipe whoever wants to go back to the inn.
546 The rest of us should start moving out.  We are going to be a stationary target
547 if we hang around here much longer."
548   He walked over to a large log laying next to the path.  "On the log to head
549 back to the inn!"  The piper began the first strains of "Too Long in This 
550 Condition" and the log started to stir slightly.  He glanced over at the upset
551 commander and did not see who rode the log back to the inn.  Walking back o
552 the group, "Commander, I'll be glad to restore your ship later.  In the while,
553 we are looking to prevent arms from being imported into our peaceful reality
554 back at the inn.  If this MacDonald is involved in this traffic, we'll toss
555 him to you when we run across him.  In the meantime, you might check and see
556 if you have any powder and balls for that long rifle hanging over the mantle
557 in your cabin."  Not waiting for an answer the piper inflated the pipes and
558 began playing a sprightly march, "MacNiell of Uigsdale", and started down the
559 road.  Within a few yards, the brick surface changed to a bright, uniform
560 yellow.  Turning his head, the piper saw the company beginning to move off
561 along the road.  Keeping the pace slow, he moved through the warm summer air.
