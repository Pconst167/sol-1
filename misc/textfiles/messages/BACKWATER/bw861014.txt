57 TALES OF ROGER GUTS, P.I.
58 
59    6:12pm.
60    I had gathered the four of them together in Og's room. Chez was on the
61 recliner in the corner, biting his nails. Hookie was on a barstool, pouring
62 himself whatever wasn't nailed down. Rommel sat on the couch, using Og
63 as a footstool.
64    "Where's Aspen? I wanted him here as well."
65    Chez stopped his nail-biting long enough to answer me. "He's in the
66 hospital. One of those cigarettes finally got him, and he set himself on
67 fire with it. Superficial burns, though, he should be back in no time."
68    "Look, what's this all about, Guts? We've got a show in less than three
69 hours. Have you caught the killer yet?"
70    "Not yet, Rommel, but I'm getting very close."
71    "Oh, come on, man, you've had all day! When are you going to..."
72    His eyes locked on to the apple resting in my hand. As I started tossing
73 it up and down, the other two sat up and followed it with their eyes.
74    It was Chez who broke the silence. "Hey, be careful with that. Can't
75 those things explode or something?"
76    "Well, I hadn't heard of that happening, but I have recently discovered
77 that apples are excellent memory aids."
78    Hookie put down his glass. "So, you figured it out. Well, I'm glad. I,
79 for one, am tired of living this lie."
80    Rommel slumped back on the couch. "So what happens, now? You blackmail
81 us to keep quiet?"
82    "Now that hurts. Don't you understand what's going on? You start using
83 some long-forgotten songs that were never recorded or copyrighted, make
84 a fortune with them, and suddenly somebody's trying to kill you. Find the
85 original songwriter, and you've found someone with a motive!"
86    "You mean that one of those singers from Apple records is after us?"
87    "Right. Figure out which one it is, and you've got you're killer. Do you
88 know the writer's name?"
89    "No, but we can find out." Chez leapt from his chair, snatched the
90 apple from my hand, and stuck it in Og's face. "Mr. Hanson, you were
91 telling us about the auditions this morning."
92    As Og gazed into the apple, his expression changed. He suddenly realized
93 he was down on all fours, with Rommel's feet on his back. He stood up, and
94 angrily brushed Rommel off him. "Mr. Starr, I've asked you before to keep
95 your feet off of me!"
96    Chez grabbed his shoulders. "Never mind that now, Hanson. I've got to
97 know the names of the people you auditioned this morning."
98    "All of them, Mr. Lennon?"
99    "All you can remember, Hanson."
100    "Well, let's see...Jimmy Jason, Melinda Baker, a group called the Woof's,
101 Allister and the Roos,..."
102    Click!
103    "From Australia?"
104    "Why, yes, Mr. McCartney, I believe so. Have you heard of them?"
105    "Allister's first name is Gordon?"
106    "That's right."
107    "Describe him."
108    "Oh...well, let's see, tall, a bit thin, muscular, great tan, early
109 wenties..."
110    "My, God, it's him! Our own roadie is out to get us!"
111    "Blimey, what did I say?"
112    "Never mind, Hanson. Here, have an apple."
113    "Oh, thanks." He bit it, dropped it, and slumped to the couch, that faraway
114 look back in his eyes.
115    "Gentleman, we've got a problem. We're up against a guy who knows his
116 way inside-out through a concert tour. He's got complete access to every
117 aspect of the concert, and has probably already laid out all kinds of traps
118 for you from here to the Hollywood Bowl. He'll stop at nothing to keep you
119 from making that show."
120    "Swell. When do we leave?"
121    "You mean you want to go through with this?"
122    "Why not? You're here, aren't you? You'll protect us. Or you won't get paid."
123    "Ok, guys, but remember one thing - in a rock concert, no one can hear you
124 scream."
125    "Big deal", mumbled Hookie, "they usually can't hear us sing, either."
126    "Well, if we're going, let's go. We should have been on our way there
127 ten minutes ago. Hookie, you get Og's feet. Rommel and I will carry the
128 other end. Lead the way, Guts."
129    As the three of them struggled to pick up their drummer, I checked my
130 ammo clips. Then I slipped over to the door, peeked up and down the hall,
131 and motioned the others to follow me.
132    We made it safely to the back stairs, and quickly stumbled down 14 floors
133 to the garage. I moved in first, ducking behind cars, until the band's limo
134 was in sight. As we started to get up to make a run for the car, we were all
135 suddenly thrown back as it exploded.
136    "Damn!", cried Rommel, "My favorite shades were in there!"
137    I smiled at him. "Well, what are you waiting for? Go in there and get them!"
138    "So, what now, Guts? What do we use for wheels?"
139    "This could be more dangerous than I thought, Chez. We may have to take
140 a cab."

163 It wasn't a particularly unusual knife,  it wasn't too long,  nor 
164 was  it too short.  The craftsman who designed it knew his  trade 
165 well, for it's perfect balance caused it to fit in the hand as if 
166 it were a part of it,  an extension of being.  The knife had seen 
167 much  use,  and  the small pockets of rust here and there  showed 
168 that it was not treated extremely well during those years of use. 
169 Yet it was well oiled,  so there wasn't complete neglect.  It was 
170 simply a knife that one doesn't think about, it is there when you 
171 need it,  and when done it gets thrown in the drawer or box until 
172 next time.  And yet this belied its strength and power, for there 
173 were other knives to be used, yet this was the one that is picked 
174 up.  There  was no nonsense about this knife.  A common  pair  of 
175 brass rivits clamped the wooden handle to the forged carbon steel 
176 blade.  Each time I pick it up I'm amazed at how well it fits. It 
177 was  ment  to be in the hand,  not hidden away in some drawer  or 
178 box. The way the fingers curled over the wood, and the thumb over 
179 the hilt,  it was  a perfect fit,  a union  of flesh  and  steel.

297     She touched his knee with her hand and said, "Speak to me."
298     At first he couldn't look her in the eyes. He felt embarrassed by it all,
299 and humility was the only way he knew to express it. Still without looking up,
300 he did speak.
301     "The dreams are visions to my different age. Without them, my life here
302 would be so empty. Some call it escapism. I call it survival."
303     She touched his face. A slight pause, then he looked up, into her eyes.
304 Eyes with an inner fire, two suns, almost blinding to gaze upon, yet the
305 longing overpowered the pain. He looked deeper.
306     "Your eyes. They seem to glow from within. Are you..."
307     She silenced him with another touch, to his lips.
308     "Speak no more. You have told me what I needed to know. Now quiet. Relax.
309 Lie down. Think about what you have said about dreams. I will return
310 tomorrow and we will speak of your different age again."
311     She left, her gown making swishing noises as the strips of glittering
312 cloth intermingl with her long legs. He watched her leave. He did not
313 rise from his berth. While metal and not very comfortable, it was the most
314 secure thing in his cabin, on a ship, hurtling from star to star.

318     Shadows gathered around her campsite like watchosts conjured up
319 by some solitary witch or woodsprite made anxious by this strange visitor,
320 she with her sword lying unsheathed across her knees, clad in leather and
321 steel, bloodstained.  Her hair was a fiery corona, putting the small dim
322 tongues of her fire to shame.  The light ran along the blade she held,
323 shaped hollows on her face, her throat, glinted on the chain there.
324     Now and again she glanced up at the encircling shadows, disturbed
325 by her sense of being watched, unwilling to admit to fear among trees she
326 had known as a child.  These were her woods, and if any spirits haunted
327 them, they ought by rights to welcome her, Siri Tieslin AvCaerdith come
328 home.  
329     Home.  Her eyes fell to the sword.  Blinded momentarily by the flash
330 as it shifted in her grip, she saw the beginnings of vision on her eyelids.
331 The blade bit into her palms as her hands tightened in protest.  Not now,
332 now again-- The blue sky flung itself from horizon to horizon, gleamed
333 rose and gold with the rising of the sun.  On the hills beacons flamed
334 and died.  And on the hill shaped like a burial mound a red-haired woman
335 rode a black horse, and the dark shapes of hounds coursed before her.
336 The hunted shrank into a hollow in the grass, tiny, black-haired child
337 with fearful eyes watching the approach of his death.
338     "No!" Tieslin flung her sword away.  It scattered dirt and leaves 
339 in its passage.  She bowed her head onto her arms, shaking.  
340      This had brought her home to ruined Caerdithas, sent her running
341 for her last refuge as the hounds of her visions sent the boy into
342 flight.  She uncurled on hand, regarded the thin lines of welling
343 red blood.  Ill luck, Rall would have said dourly; Rall with his
344 bird-feather charms and carved bone luck pieces rattling from helm
345 and neck and wrists-- how he could fight anything with all that jewelry
346 on--But Rall's luck kept him safe.  Tieslin smiled, raising her head.
347 She touched a finger to the single jewel on her chain.  
348      For luck, Rall told her.  Even a heathen should carry some luck with
349 her.
350      For a heathen, you're generous with your luck, Tieslin retorted.
351      The Lady's not exactly an Adherent to the Doctrine, Rall grinned.
352     Thinking of Rall made the shadows seem less threatening.  They were
353 only shadows, after all, cast by the firelight, blown by the breeze that
354 stirred the branches overhead.  Tieslin curled up on the dirt, with
355 her face on her arm turned toward the fire.  In the morning, Caerdithas.

440 
441                        grounded.No voice phone calls, no masswise travel.
442

444                             ribs.not fun.When you are twenty feet up a tree,
445                            your father makes you cut a branch in an unsafe
446                              place, and you suddenly descend to the fifteen-
447                             foot level and halt "cos a cut branch lodges in

453                      So, overall, I'm really cheerful.Ah Well, I guess that

505      I would like to know from which newsgroup within the USENET's great
506 scheme of things the "ROGER GUTS, P.I." story is coming from.  I don't
507 recall who was writing it, but I think the guy is in California.
508      Could the person UPLOADING the RG-PI material let me know where I
509 originally saw it since I missed the first chapters (currently around
510 chapter nine and trying to catch up).
511      Mail all responces via UUCP, care of your favorite site to:

518       thank you so much for calling The Club Plaza BBS.

527 to check out your board after I get off of here, but obviously if you have

540     He dreamt about her. They sat amidst joyous townfolk in a village square on
541 old earth. Harvest time was time for celebration, and the village and its people
542 put on their best. They sat in a small cafe', casting carefree glances at
543 passing celebrants, then longing glances at each other. The happiness in the
544 air tickled their tongues.
545     She spoke a silky whisper, its rising and falling taking his imagination to
546 new highs. Her voice was music and more, a food for hungry men in search of
547 manna.
548     "This place is wonderful, but we can not stay forever."
549     Holding her eyes with his, he replied in his own soft voice.
550     "Forever isn't so long, nor is it so bad. Why can't we stay?"
551     Her face changed from a playful smile to earnest consideration.
552     "You know why. There is no point in discussing it. We can't change anything
553 with talk. We must leave, sooner now because of your words."
554     ...you words, he thought. Have I said something wrong?
555     "You are right, of course, forgive my weakness. I am enchanted, and don't
556 wish to end this state."
557     Her eyes searched in his own, small wrinkles appearing near their corners.
558     "You don't need to apologize. Let us depart. Our paths must continue to
559 move forward. Destiny and fate, muses and prophets, must never be kept waiting."
560     She leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek. It burned with the fire
561 of ecstasy unlike anything he had felt before. He turned his face in hopes of
562 more, but she was already standing, looking out across the square. She did not
563 see his attempt.
564     They walked across the street to the boarding house they had stayed in the
565 past two weeks. It's white washed picket fence surrounding the entire structure
566 like the web of a spider surrounding its insect prey. He stopped before she
567 could open the white gate and enter the yard. He was afraid. A chill ran down
568 and up his spine. He froze in place, eyes intent on the gate her hand rested
569 on. She looked at him and pulled on his left hand with her other hand. He did
570 not move, nor did he remove his stare. He could not move.
571     "Come on. We must hurry. This is no time to stop." She urged him with
572 her voice.
573      He could not speak.
574     "Now!" Her voice became more insistent.
575     Nothing. He was not there. The white and the fence and the house and
576 the town swallowed him up. She stood alone. The gate was open.
577     He awoke to soaking sheets and the buzz of the ship's claxon. More
578 gravity soon, and planetfall.

592 routines. Are you developing on the 64 or are you (I hope) cross compiling? Like VAX to C64? Ya, that's the ticket.
