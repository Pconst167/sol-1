35      Emu watched the crowd to see if anyone was responding to Trainor's
36 story.  For a while all was quiet as the story of a man's mistake was
37 recounted.  Now he was trying to rectify his mistake, try to make up for
38 the destruction that he caused by trying to stop future destruction.
39      An unfamiliar force to most of those at the Inn, what had just been
40 described could wipe out all that was known to us; all that we loved and
41 called our own.  Trainor looked haggard and needed help.  He asked us for
42 assistance, and we sit and consider the request.
43      From nearby, Emu heard a sharp cry, followed by a couple interesting
44 words.  Looking, he saw Piper rise up and commit himself to Trainor's aid.
45 Everyone watched as Piper walked across the room and say the immortal
46 words, "Count me in."  That was all Emu needed for a final incentive.  The
47 next voice heard in the Inn's common room was that of Emu: 
48     "Surely, Piper, you need someone along to help you take care of your
49 sharp utensiles.  Trainor, I'm in too!"

52         The halls are quiet now, but the memories of more vibrant days
53 linger on even in the solitude. A lone janitor plies his trade slowly up
54 and down the halls, his broom collecting everything that would be so
55 unfortunate to fall in its path. Onward and onward, the broom and its
56 driver make their way from classroom to classroom, all empty now, devoid
57 of the students who give them life. The broom cares not that these rooms
58 are empty. The driver is thankful of the fact, it is so much easier to
59 sweep when the students are gone on the pursuits of summer. It is the
60 season for cleaning, now that learning is over. The chalk dust of yet
61 another lecture has long since been swept away. No broken pencils and
62 crumpled papers grace the hallowed halls of this erudite institution.
63 The lockers are empty, and the desks are clear. All of this suits the
64 man with the broom. The man with the job that never ends is thankful for
65 these peaceful days of summertime. The broom knows the course well,
66 empty halls are vacations.

69 yes, more terminal jocketes making waves about terminal jockies making waves
70 about spies. It never ceases to amaze me that some folks are such showoffs
71 they must constantly be making a show even if what they are showing is their
72 stupidity.

82      BERUIT -- (AP)  The Yasser Arafat Performing Arts Center was the scene
83 of a series of remarkable events last night with the season premier of the
84 Lebanese Symphony Orchestra.  Nattily attired in a rhinestone-studded
85 powder blue straight jacket, guest conductor Dr. Frankenstupe achieved
86 musical history with his first appearance in this Lebanese capital.
87      Dr. Frankenstupe started the evening with a melodic rendition of PDQ
88 Bach's Opus 54, the Dead Duck Symphony.  A sour note was struck by an
89 overenthusiastic oboist; but a well-placed kick from the second violin
90 quickly solved the problem.  Next on the program was Frankenstupe's own
91 composition, Etude for Chainsaw and Jackhammer in E minor.  The percussion
92 section performed flawlessly and with the final crescendo, the crowd leaped
93 to its feet roaring its appreciation.
94      It can be said that Frankenstupe's greatest moment was when the Druze
95 Boy's Choir joined the orchestra for the program's finale, the Flatulent
96 Chorale.  The second movement literally blew away the first two rows of the
97 audience.  There wasn't a dry eye in the hall as the last notes of the
98 piece faded into memory.
99      A knowledgable Beruit crowd brought Frankenstupe back for an unpre
100 cidented thirteen curtain calls.  Unfortunately, on the last curtain call,
101 several armed men in black stocking caps charged the podium.  Gunfire 
102 erupted at the orchestra battle to save their beloved guest conductor.  One
103 terrorist was captured and currently is in intensive care at Beruit General
104 Hospital with a piccalo lodged where the sun don't shine.
105      When the smoke cleared, Dr. Frankenstupe had disappeared and 
106 authorities fear he may have been taken hostage.  No ransom demands have
107 been made public at this time.  There are unconfirmed reports that as Dr.
108 Frankenstupe was carried bodily from the hall, he uttered one word...
109 "Mother!"  This reporter will continue to give full details of the Doctor's
110 disappearance as they become available.

165 "Thank Amigc that this is only a First-Order spell.  I don't think I'd enjoy
166 doing a Third-Order", I said.
167 The Doctor looked up from the command console of the TARDIS, and looked at
168 us, busy with our preparations.  "Whatza Third-Order spell, or for that matter,
169 What's a First-Order spell?"
170 "Simple, my friend.  The spell's complexity increases with the number of
171 dimensions you have to span simultaneously.  The three spatial dimensions count
172 as one, as they are a special case.  The spell we are preparing only spans
173 the Paratemporal dimension; you are taking care of the Spatial and Temporal
174 components with the TARDIS.  Thus, our spell need only be a First-Order."
175 The Doctor shrugged, and emitted a low, "Oh."  Seconds later, we heard the
176 familiar "Shwush-thud" of the Time Rotor, meaning our journey was complete.
177 "I believe that I'll glance outside, and see what's going on", the Doctor said.
178 He touched something on the control panel.  The monitor screen lit up, showing
179 a traffic jam of grand proportions.
180 The cause of said jam, it seemed, was the sudden appearance of an old-style
181 English call-box in the center of the intersection.
182 "Damn, left the Chameleon Circuit off again.  Milch, see if you can't hurry
183 your preparations up a bit, hmmmmm?  I believe that someone's going t
184 to investigate our 'arrival' quite shortly."
185 "We're doing the best that we can", I said, as Grann and I began the casting.
186 The Doctor knew what trouble interruption of the casting could cause, but that
187 did not prevent him from muttering, "hurry" as he saw several police cars
188 arriving at the scene, and policemen getting out to find out just what the
189 trouble was.
190 Grann took over the recital of the words, and I began the material casting.
191 Symbols drawn and erased, dust scattered just so, objects crushed, and Grann
192 droning on all the while...
193 The final bit.  Wands out, circles made in air, circles glow, expand, become
194 wavy, fuzzier, grow larger, change colors, expand again, travel like phantoms
195 though the walls, encircle the TARDIS, police halt at the sight, energies grow
196 and entwine, preparation for the very last actions...
197 Two coins appear, one in my hand and one in Grann's, are thrown over our right
198 shoulders.  They disappear, as if they never had existed.  As do we.
199 Imagine the surprise of the at least nine dozen spectators as the circle of
200 glowing energy, once confined to more or less a horizontal plane, now begins
201 spinning in all directions, defining a sphere about the call-box.  Imagine 
202 further their surprise when quite suddenly, all that vanishes, and the only
203 brief reminder that there was SOMETHING there is the boom and violent wind that
204 follows the inrush of air to fill the vacuum.
205 Now just imagine our surprise, as we look over the new landscape through the
206 monitor, and see....

208 Fido-person: My 'xmodem' is a BASIC/ml hybrid. It is probably responsible
209 for part of the extra delay. Add in the well known fact that on CIS you
210 can count on about %50 of your time being 'wait states' in their computers
211 or network and...
212 As for YMODEM, I can't get it straight from TeleGodzilla. I can't use 
213 xmodem as it is in squeezed format & I still don't have an unsqueeze 
214 utilities for any of my systems. So I'd have to 'Type' it. Unfortunately,
215 I keep losing chars....
216 ________________________________Leonard____________________________________
217 Leonard: Why don't you call me direct at the IBM Club board?  We might be able
218   to work something out if you're really interested in getting Xmodem/Ymodem.
219  If your modem can support almost anything besides straight ASCII, there's a
220   good chance I've got something that will work... 
221 L'homme: You're a little more familiar with Pro-Yam.  Will it support CIS B
222   protocol in host mode?  or only calling CompuServe?  Thanks.

279   down the hall and out the door i pace in order that i may soon
280 forget why it is that i take to walking in the night.  my mind longs
281 for something other than the acts of futility, the daily chores.
282 what i would like now, as a distraction, is something slightly out of
283 the ordinary.  maybe to forego the need to cling to reality and pick
284 up the flight offered by fantasy might provide the wanted slice of
285 life.  maybe...
286 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
287   after telling a friend that i would be alright walking alone, i 
288 continue on the course that would take me home.  now that the sun has
289 left, it is feeling cooler and the breeze is still very welcome.
290   i would be home although i find that the lights draw me to the
291 place where i notice the faint din of voices.  for want of some
292 possible souce of excitement or entertainment i turn ot walk to the
293 source.  i am almost at the door when the branch of a tree catches at
294 my shawl, my hair falls out from under the cowl.  tucking it back in
295 lace under the fabric i note that this is no ordinary tree for it
296 contains an element so as to make me feel at peace.  with the garment
297 back in place, i snap a small brach, or twig, to carry with me to 
298 remind me of this peace.
299   once inside i realize that this must be the place that has taken
300 away the generic meaning of the word "inn", and has changed it to 
301 iclude also the words "genesis" and "nexus".  highly acclaimed, and
302 without an equal, the inn is surely the center of what must be a 
303 great discussion or debate as so many people inside have clustered
304 together to speak of a common topic with such vigor.
305   not to attract too much attention i make my way to te group of
306 people that are consumed by this interest and tap one of the more
307 confidant speakers on the shoulder to ask my question.
308   "excuse me, could you tell me what it is that is so gripping?  i
309 have missed what it was that has been said and would like to know
310 what has is happening here..."

353     As Emu was contemplating his last words, the ones that could change his
354 boring existance forever, he saw her walk into the confusion of the Inn all
355 alone.  She had a strange look about her, like she had just gone through
356 hell in a one-person liferaft.  Her hair was bundled up precariously under
357 the scarf on her head, as though it had been quickly tossed together.  Next
358 to her breast she clutched a branch from the Giving tree outside the door.
359     As she made her way around the noisy throng, a few others saw and watched
360 her.  Emu ordered a steaming mug of spiced wine, guided her to a seat, and
361 set the wine down in front of her.  She took it gratefully, sipped it, and
362 sighed.
363     "What's everyone talking so excitedly about?" she asked.  "I have missed
364 what was said earlier."
365     "The man warming his hands at the fire has just asked us all to help him
366 in his quest.  He needs our assistance in stopping a threat to the whole
367 time/space continuim."
368     "Oh."
369     She was thoughtful for a moment, then, "What's his name?"
370     "Trainor", Emu replied.  "By the way, I'm called Emu.  What may I call
371 you?"
372     She ignore his question, and asked "Where is he from?"
373     "He came from some point of time outside of our's.  He arrived in the
374 machine outside about an hour ago."  She sat quietly as Emu told her all
375 that he knew of the man called Trainor.

379      As L'homme stepped into the room, wiping the moisture from his sweaty
380 palm, he knew at once something was not right. A few moments ago he heard
381 the voices of three people when now there was but one. Weapon drawn, he
382 scanned the room with senses alert. All he found was a rather conspicuous
383 secretary hiding behind scatterings of unattended paperwork with one ear
384 pressed to her office intercom. It was no surprise that she continued with
385 hardly a glance for she was far too engrossed with what was happening on
386 the other end of the line. He recognized that if there were danger, it
387 certainly wasn't here. Lowering the weapon to his side, out of view to
388 the secretary, L'homme shook his head and commented.
389      "Harumph! Isn't anything sacred anymore? I mean really." That seemed
390 to do the job, for as he reached the front of the desk she spun around to
391 greet him.
392      "Oh! Yes, may I help you?"
393      "I'm here to see a man about a... Actually, I'm here to see Ms. Lamb,
394 I understand she is in. I would like to see her if she is available."

396      "I'm afraid that won't be possible at the moment, sir. She's in the
397 middle of a... a conference. Yes, that's it, she's in a conference with
398 her... her lawyer."
399      "A lawyer is it?" The voice from over L'homme's shoulder could be
400 none other than Fellows. L'homme turned just in time to see him with his
401 hand in his jacket, concealing his sidearm in an inconspicuous fashion.
402      "Good thinking," thought L'homme. "We needn't arouse any suspicion
403 with anything other than our presence."
404 "So there you are Fellows," he said aloud. "I'd thought you had
405 been lost."
406      "Little boys do tend to get lost," he said with a motion back at the
407 hallway. "But what of this meeting with the lawyer? Do you think it's
408 legit?" he mused. "Then again, lawyers have never barred our way before."
409      "We're not here to judge the validity of his credentials," L'homme
410 said as he turned back to the secretary. "We are here to see Ms. Lamb."
411 Just then, words came across the intercom that drew their attention.
412 Fellows hand went back inside his jacket.

501 remember the tune.  Oh, yes.  Hmmmm-a-hummmmm, hmmmm-a-hummmmm....
502 Max: If I bring a disk to the next PorSFiS meet, could you bring a copy?  The
503 'Higgyterm' has a few VERY irritating "features", enough so that I would not
504 be at all disappointed if I never used it again.  (Why don't they turn OFF 
505 the SID chip when they're finished dialing?  That hum at volume 15 is enough
506 to drive one stark raving sane.)

Slowly the Former opened his eyes.  Sunlight was streaming down from the
545 windows.  The little room looked much larger in the daylight.  As did our fury
546 little friend with the slowly adjusting eyes.
547     A stillness came over the scene that relaxed the Former after a restless
548 night.  The stillness injected the feeling that there was time to do pretty
549 much anything he really wanted to do.
550     He announced to nobody his schedule for the day and that he intended to
551 follow all of it to the letter.  Which he did not do by any means.  Since the
552 schedule required about nine things that he was too short to do.
553     The first one of them was to go down and ask everyone when they were going
554 to leave.  Depending on how many people actually answered this question, he
555 was going to ask them if they actually planned on leaving.
556     Of course, he wanted to clear up the little detail of where they were
557 actually going to go anyway.  What they would do when they got there, if they
558 ever really did.

559     Mind you, he never really got up the nerve to do any of this, and instead
560 his wandered around his room, above the commons, and stretched all day.  His
561 mind full of thoughtss of young koala female bears, instead of the business at
562 hand.
