 30        PENTAGON BIOWARFARE RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN UNIVERSITY LABORATORIES
 31  
 32           Overshadowed b Star Wars and overlooked by the media, the push
 33      toward biowarfare has been one of the Reagan aministration's best
 34      kept secret. The research budget for infectious diseases and toxins
 35      has increased tenfold since fiscal '81 and most of the '86 budget of
 36      $42 million went to 24 U.S. university campues where the world's most
 37      deadl organisms are being cultured in campus labs.
 38           The amount of military money available for biotechnology research
 39      is a poweful attraction for scientists whose civilian funding
 40      resources dried up. Scientists formerl working on widespread killers
 41      ike cancer now use their talents developing strains of such rare
 42      pathogens as anthrax, dengue, Rift Valley fever, Japanes encephalitis,
 43      tularemia, shigella, botulin, Q fever, and myctoxins.
 44           May members of the academic community find the trend alarming
 45      but when MIT's biology departent voted to refuse Pentagon funds for
 46      biotech research, the administration forced it to revere its
 47      decision. And, in 1987, te University of Wisconsin hired Philip
 48      Sobocinski, a retired Army colonel, to help professos tailor their
 49      research to attract Pentagon-funded biowarfare research to the school.
 50      Richard Jannaccio, a former science riter at UW, was dismissed from
 51      his job on August 25, 1987, the day after the tudent newspaper, THE
 52      DAILY CARDINL, published his story disclosing the details of Colonel
 53      Sobicinski's mission at the University.
 54           Since the U.S. is a sgnatory to the 1972 Biological and Toxic
 55      Weapons Convention which bans "development, prodution, stockpiling
 56      and use of mirobes or their poisonous products except in amounts
 57      necessary for protective and peaceful rsearch," the university-based
 58      work is being pursued under the guise of defensive pojects aimed at
 59      developing vaccnes and protective gear. Scientists who oppose the
 60      program insist that germ-warfare defense is clearly impractical; every
 61      person would have to be vaccinated for every known harmful biological
 62      agent.  Since vaccinatng the entire population would be virtually
 63      impossible, the only application of a defensivedevelopment is in
 64      conjunction wth offensive use. Troops could be effectively vaccinated
 65      for a single agent prior to launching an attack with that agent.
 66      Colonel David Huxsoll, commander of the U.S. Army Meical Research
 67      Institute of Infetious Diseases admits that offensive research is
 68      indistinguishable from defensive research even for those doing it.
 69           Each of the sources for this synopsis raised ethical questions
 70      about the perversion of academa by military money and about the U.S.
 71      engaging in a biological arms race that could rival the nuclear
 72      threat, yet none mentioned the safety or the security of the labs
 73      involved.  The failure to investigte this aspect of the issue is a
 74     striking omission.  Release of pathogens, either by accidet or
 75      design, would prove tragicat any of the following schools:  Brigham
 76      Young, California Institute of Technology, Colorado State University,
 77      Emory, Illinis Institute of Technology, Iowa University, M.I.T.,
 78      Purdue, State University of N.Y. at Albany, Texas A&M, and the
 79      Universities of California, California at Davis, Cincinati,
 80      Connecticut, Georgia, Idao, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland,
 81      assachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Utah.

 92    Battle was followed by victory - but not for the group.  During the
 93 battle, I secretly collected some solar energy into my 'body' for later
 94 use - no point in using up myself to help everyone in the future.  After
 95 some gooooood pure rays had entered my body, I felt ready for the foray.
 96 Alas!  Again my neglect had seeled my fate.  Kurfur had slain hundreds of
 97 the enemy, but the Beserkergang had left him spent.  The Policeman had
 98 just came to conscienceness, hidden from the 'creatures'.  This would
 99 require some mental gymnastics, but I found it to be easier with my
100 Zen training.  I diverted some energy as a life force to Kurfur,
101 allowing him conscienceness for an hour (which should be enough for
102 his body to regenerate and gain strength.  He should be able to hold his
103 own after that hour) I thought.  The remaining energies were used to
104 neatly convert the mass of the humanoids into unbundled energy 
105 |REMEMBER E=MC2?| and I used that to secure the landscape from 
106 flying into the air.  The energy re-direction was done by increasing
107 my gravity to a small black hole.  If I had not first secured the
108 landscape with the extra energy, my friends would be stuck to me
109 like refridgerator magnets.  Simply put, the land was clean and
110 visible without the bodies, Kurfur was slowly recovering, and
111 John (please forgive me if the name is wrong, I can't remember at the
112 moment and I'm in a hurry) seemed a little happier to find the brownie
113 not around to irritate him.  I was tired from the exercise, but
114 I knew that this was not even one-tenth of what I had to do in the
115 future.  I took a deep mental breath, and saw to their recovery.
116  
117    I did seem a little darker though; collecting solar energy
118 does that to a 'body'.

241    "Huh, what?!", I said slowly sitting up, and then I remembered. We were
242 captured! I started, seeing my companions lying on the ground beside me, 
243 except for the Guru, who was wide awake and sitting next to me.
244    "How..?", I said.
245    "No problem, just elementary physics.", he said.
246    "Where is Kufur, and Johnny Edison?"
247    "They're fine. Kufur went into Berserkergang, and that's why he isn't
248 here he killed creatures until they retreated with you. Johnny was left
249 unnoticed by the creatures, for he wasn't acting alive at the time, and
250 before you ask, the Brownie woke up before you and went to join Johnny and
251 Kufur, 'to keep an eye on Johnny', he said.", the Guru said, knowingly.
252    "I'll wake the others up-", I said, but Hagbard interrupted me.
253    "Not just yet, I have something to tell you", he said, and I looked 
254 intently at him, "You are the one who must learn of himself and defeat
255 your own enemy inside before you can defeat the Dark Ones."
256    "What is my own enemy?"
257    "You will find out, in due time.", he said to me. Then he said, "Wake
258 up everyone, we have to join up with Kufur and the others".
259    The Wanderer woke up the first of all of them and put the white orb,
260 which was still in his hands, inside of his magical bag, which is really
261 a portable nothing-ness that all true magicians carry. Where they can call
262 up materials at a moment's notice. Everyone else woke up then and the Guru
263 lead us back toward where the rest of our party was...

268              Nomination for the "Ten Best Censored Stories of 1987"
269  
270            BIASED COVERAGE OF THE ARIAS PEACE PLAN BY AMERICA'S PRESS
271  
272          On August 7, 1987, five Central American nations -- Costa Rica,
273      El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua -- signed a regional
274      peace proposal that was authored by Costa Rican president, Oscar
275      Arias. The proposal, known as the Arias Plan, set specific guidelines
276      and target dates for each nation to comply with in order to stabilize
277      Central America and bring peace to the region.
278           Two separate studies monitoring U.S. press coverage of the Arias
279      peace plan revealed a startling bias in how America's leading
280      newspapers covered the region following August 7th.  A national media
281      watchdog group, the New York-based Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting
282      (FAIR), concluded that the peace accord set off a U.S. media reaction
283      that "showed once again the extent to which White House assumptions
284      are shared by the national press corps" and how "Reagan's obsession
285      with Nicaragua has turned into a media obsession."  FAIR's 90-day
286      analysis of THE NEW YORK TIMES found that the TIMES devoted three
287      times as many column inches of news space to Nicaragua than it did to
288      Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador combined.
289           The other study, by the Media Alliance, a San Francisco-based
290      nonprofit organization of media professionals, monitored stories about
291      the peace plan that appeared in seven major dailies -- THE N.Y. TIMES,
292      L.A. TIMES, CHRISTAN SCIENCE MONITOR, SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS, S.F.
293      CHRONICLE, S.F.EXAMINER, and the OAKLAND TRIBUNE. The conclusion was
294      the same -- most newspapers followed the Reagan administration's
295      direction as to what deserved coverage in Central America. Altogether,
296      the cmmittee members read, sorted, and analyzed a total of 406
297      individual articles and editorials and found:
298           1) More than 80% of the articles published during the first six
299      weeks after the signing of the plan focused entirely or almost
300      entirely on Nicaragua -- the Reagan administration's demands on
301      Nicaragua's Sandinista government, the prospects for renewed contra
302      aid, or the extent to which Nicaragua was abiding by the Arias plan;
303           2) While the seven newspapers published numerous articles
304      critical of the Sandinistas and their efforts to comply with the plan,
305      serious human rights problems and violations of the plan by the
306      governments of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala went largely
307      unreported;
308           3) Sources quoted for comments and analysis in the seven papers
309      were almost always either administration officials, contra leaders, or
310      representatives of other conservative organizations that advocate
311      military solutions to the region's political conflicts;
312           4) Editors at the seven papers, when contacted by the SAN
313      FRANCISCO BAY GUARDIAN for its article, generally acknowledged that
314      the national press has allowed the Reagan administration to set the
315      tone for Central American news coverage.
316           One result of the biased coverage of Central America last year
317      was that Americans were outraged when the Sandinistas shut down the
318      CIA-subsidized LA PRENSA (now reopened) while they were not even aware
319      that 70 journalists had been murdered by death squads in El Salvador
320      and Guatemala during the past decade. And that death squad activities
321      have increased in those two nations since August 7th.

334 Hey Lord Whatsyerface Beaker,
335      Nice to see you back in the land of imagined reality (is there any
336 other kind?). Congrats, too, on the promotion. Couldn't have happened to
337 a nicer deity. As you've allready noticed, things are getting pretty 
338 wierd around here, but what the 'ell, it fills up disk space. At least
339 its not as strange as on the river. Its getting so that an honest
340 Berserker can't get his boat out and go Viking with his friends anymore.
341 By the way, I think I've finally gotten rid of that low-life, Zod. If he
342 shows his border around here anymore, he's gonna get a firm scolding.
343      I'll continue with my monologue as soon as the Brownie gets within
344 range (heh heh!).

394    As to being untouched, very little ever sinks into the mind of a 
395 Berserker, making us very hard to force to conform to todays values and
396 ideas. In other words, we call them wrongly as we see them (if you catch

408                   DUMPING OUR TOXIC WASTES ON THE THIRD WORLD
409  
410           Exporting hazardous and toxic wastes to Third World countries is
411      a growth industry. The exported material includes heavy metal residues
412      and chemical-contaminated wastes, pharmaceutical refuse, and municipal
413      sewage sludge and incinerator ash. The risks involved for countries
414      that accept our wastes range from contamination of groundwater and
415      crops to birth defects and cancer.
416           Traditionally, the majority of U.S. toxic waste exports have gone
417      to Canada where regulations are less stringent than in the U.S. But
418      now the most abrupt increase is in shipments to the Third World where
419      the regulations are either nonexistent or sketchily enforced.
420           Creating the search for new overseas markets is an explosion in
421      the volume of recorded hazardous wastes beng produced in the U.S.
422      According to the General Accounting Office, the amount rose from about
423      9 million metric tons in 1970 to at least 247 million in 1984; other
424      experts place the current figure close to 400 millon metric tons.
425           U.S. officials, aware of the sensitive legal and foreign policy
426      questions involved, are reluctant to crack down on illegal dumpers
427      and, in fact, the government itself is reponsible for generating a
428      significant portion of the hazardous waste exports.  One large illegal
429      operation broken up last year received more than half its toxic wastes
430      from various branches of the Federal government, mainly the military.
431           Some examples of what is happening as discovered by the authors
432      using court records, interviews, and the Freedom of Information Act:
433           Philadelphia is planning to ship 600,000 tons of ash residue a
434      year from its municipal incinerator to Panama which plans to use the
435      materials as landfill for roadbeds;
436           U.S. sludge may end up in the tiny British Caribbean colony of
437      Turks and Caicos Islands which proposes to use it as fertilizer;
438           L.P.T., a company with offices in American Samoa and California,
439      is seeking approval to build an incinerator in American Samoa to burn
440      U.S. wastes and export the ash to the Philippines where it would be
441      used as landfill;
442           Western Pacific Waste Repositories, based in Carson City, Nevada,
443      is poposing to build a hazardous waste storage and treatment plant on
444      Erikub atoll, an unhinhabited area of the Marshall Islands.
445           The key U.S. government officials responsible for monitoring
446      waste traffic claim they are powerless.  "Under the federal system, we
447      only have control over what's in the country," says Wendy Grieder, an
448      official in the EPA's Office of International Activities.  "Once it
449      leaves, we can't do anything about it."
450           Finally, exported wastes may return to haunt us in a very direct
451      way.  "It's possible that we could send sludge to the Caribbean and
452      they might use it on, say, spinach or other vegetables," warned
453      Grieder.  And since the Food and Drug Administation checks only a
454      small portion of foods and vegetables that come into the U.S.,
455      exported hazardous wastes could easily end up on our dinner table.

520          TORTURE IN EL SALVADOR:THE CENSORED REPORT FROM MARIONA PRISON
521  
522           In late 1986, a 165-page report was smuggled out of the Mariona
523      men's prison in El Salvador. The report was compiled by five
524      imprisoned members of the Human Rights Commission of El Salvador
525      (CDHES). The report documents the "routine" and "systematic" use of at
526      least 40 kinds of torture on political prisoners.
527           The report made three main points: first, torture is systematic,
528      not random; second, the methods of torture are becoming more clever;
529      and finally, U.S. servicemen often act as supervisors. What is new to
530      torture in El Salvador, according to the study, is that the use of
531      torture, together with the continued (although diminished) use of
532      death-squad kidnappings of the "disappeared," are all a systematic
533      part of of the U.S. counterinsurgency program there.
534           The Marin Interfaith Task Force, from Mill Valley, California,
535      assembled the smuggled report from Mariona prison into a document
536      titled "Torture in El Salvador." Starting in September, 1986, the Task
537      Force has tried to generate media interest in the story.  Suzanne
538      Bristol of the task force, said the group sent the report to the
539      nation's major newspapers, including THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE
540      WASHINGTON POST, THE BOSTON GLOBE, and the LOS ANGELES TIMES, as well
541      as to the wire services. By February, 1987, when Alexander Cockburn
542      wrote his article for THE NATION, UPI had run a Spanish-language story
543      and the report had received coverage on Spanish-language radio, in
544      Mexican periodicals and in Europe. Follow-up calls to the above papers
545      produced nothing, except for two letters in December from Art
546      Seidenbaum of the LOS ANGELES TIMES, who first wrote "You send plenty
547      of homework," and later wrote "We really have ... no staff for making
548      a 1500-word article out of a large series of reports."
549           As Cockburn noted, it was "during this period, on November 22,
550      Secretary of State George Shultz asked Congress to approve nearly $7
551      million in police aid for El Salvador in 1987, providing the necessary
552      certification that the government of El Salvador had 'made significant
553      progress during the six-month period preceding this determination in
554      eliminating any human rights violations, including torture,
555      incommunicado detention ...'"
556           Apparently only one newspaper gave the actual report substantial
557      coverage.  The SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER ran two excellent articles by
558      free lance journalist Ron Ridenhour, who quoted State Department
559      spokesman James Callahan saying that the CDHES, the only Salvadoran
560      human rights group recognized by the United Nations, is a communist
561      "front organization." (It was Ridenhour's charges that led to the
562      revelations about the Army's massacre of civilians in My Lai.)
563           On October 26, 1987, assassins, probably belonging to the
564      Salvadoran security forces, murdered Herbert Ernesto Anaya, head of
565      the Salvadoran Human Rights Commission and the last survivor of that
566      commission's eight founders.
567           Anaya also was one of the five original researchers and authors
568      of the smuggled report from the Mariona men's prison.

702 By WENDY E. LANE Associated Press Writer
703    LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Worshipers screamed and lifted their hands toward the
704 sky as a ray of light burst through the clouds Monday evening during an outdoor
705 Mass where thousands ca}e expecting a miracle.
706    Shortly after the 6 p.m. Mass began at St. John Neumann Catholic Church,
707 throngs of pilgrims stood and applauded as many spectators pointed skyward,
708 crying that they saw Jesus and the Virgin Mary and calling id0a myracle.
709    "I saw the sun pulsating a lot and saw Jesus about 10 times," said Mamie
710 Fertitta. "Then I saw Jesus above and the doves below."
711    A dozen priests standing on a rooftop altar and 600 Eucharist ministers
712 turned their bac{c t the crowd to look at the sky and wave. After minutes of
713 silence, St. John Neumann pastor Monsignor Joseph James began to sing "Amazing
714 Grace."
715    People in the audience whipped out cameras to photograph the clouds and
716 light.
717 0  "I saw baby Jesus for an instant in the sky," said Koreth Vargahese of
718 Houston.

772  
773    Hi folks.  Lessee, as (un)offisal Wuru of Backwater, I'll try an
774 answer your question about 'life, the universe, and everything':
775  
776    It just is.  You can't explain why; to do so would make you more than
777 human (i.e., you would have to abandon a 'human' mindset, ant
77( re-pattern along different lines).  Simply put (with no offense meant):
779  
780    "Because you're there, Schmuck."
781  
782 which is one of the few good answers I got from my teacher.  The universe
783 simply exists, just the same way as a rock on the roadside exists; how
784 it got there, why it is there, and what makes it different is truely
785 immaterial, as these questions are not asked for in a metaphysical
786 context.  The only use for those three questions would be in a pseudo-
'87 framework, i.e., a society or culture, where the questions would have
788 relevence simply because the 'game' of society calls for some kind of
789 value to be placed on this information.  Metaphysical elements don't
790 always carry the same kind of0values (if any at all, as it should be
791 pure thought without the cow pucky of social customs and morality), and
792 this is often forgotten when such questions arise.  It's been my own
793 experience that people tend not to think; most societies ca|l fb some
794 form of conformance; with that comes the rejection of some actions,
795 most noteably individual thought, as a society trys to promote
796 the group over the individual.  This is why you find more Anarchists
797 who are also Metaphysiciqns (or is it magicians?  sometimes the two
798 seem the same...)  Two good answers to questions you didn't ask:
799  
800 1) The best form of government is self-government.  This is because
801 government is initially created to protect people from othur `uople in
802 the same society.  However, government is usually perverted by others
803 seeking one of the great corruptors, power.  Therefore, if people could
804 get off of their lazy buns, think things out, and act on the thought, the
805 world guld0be a better place for everyone.  Because you govern yourself,
806 you are (hopefully) given freedom and the interaction of culture without
807 conflict.  If this sounds too convoluted, just stick to the first sentence.
808  
809 2) The best religyon yc personal religion.  In other words, religion is
810 a private and personal experience, and anyone else who would tell you
811 otherwise simply perverts it into power (see #1) because the religious
812 experience is no longer on a personal basis (y.e., you have something
813 or someone you interact with instead of directly communicating/thinking).
814    Everything else is a matter of values.  Even the two answers are
815 recieved with bias on the reader's end because of values.  I don't
816 cabu whqt the rebuttals are, because I make my own answers.  If I
817 didn't, then they would not be my answers, wouldn't they?
818

856    We reached the clearing where Kurfur had slaughtered many of the 
857 endless hord of savages, and found the brownie gazing out into the woods
858 with Johnny out cold behind him. I wend0up to the brownie an said, "So 
859 you finally did it. You decided to slug it out and that idiot is gone 
860 out like a light when we need everybody awake."
861     "Don't be so angry, I can double for that loser in his stead, let's
862 get goinw", said the brownie, who was starting to continue in his 
863 put-down of Johnny Edision Inter-dememsional Policeman, when he was
864 interrupted by a groan from the same person which he was criticizing.
865     "Don't they know where to put trees", hu sayd slowly sitting up 
866 rubbing his head which contained a rather small brain for its normal size.
867     "Are you all right", I said helping him to his feet.
868     "I will be if I don't get into any more fights with that brownie".
869     "We|l, you better be, for we have to get going while it's still night
870 on this world, so that we can approach the citadel of the Lord's of 
871 Darkness under the cover of night".
872     "Trokin is right, even though the Lords of Darkness can see in the0
(73 darkness of the night as easy as in the light of the day, we can still use
874 it to enter into the citadel without the knowledge of the guards.", said
875 the Guru.
876     "Let's get going then. I'm ready for some more battle.", said Kurfur
8'7 awqkening from the Berserkergang sleep that had been upon him for many
878 hours.
879     So, with that, we started off towards the center of the island where

936 I once asked what life is. After many hours of serious soul searching (I
937 think it was my soul), I think I know what life is. You wanna know? Too
938 bad, you'ru gonna hear it anyways:
939  
940 Life is knowing where to get the best Pizza.
941  
942 I think that compiles up the last few statements pretty well. Nothing like
943 a composite theory. Now onto deeper thoughts (but I can't swim in the deep
944 end9. Hw do we know we exist? To be alive, we must exist, but life can
945 be imitated or imagined. Existance depends upon what is perceived, but isn't
946 perception a thing intrincis to life, which can be imagined? Therefore, I
947 think that the real auestyon is to prove that you exist, and after that,
948 life is easy to prove. But how? Everything could be imagined, or real, or
949 both. Are there separate realities, or separate perceptions of one reality?
950 If there are separate realities, then who yc to say who's reality you exist
951 on? Yours? Or someone elses? Or maybe they just imagine that you exist. If
952 there is just one reality, then how could we tell, relying on simple
953 perceptions, which (as was said before) can be only imaginet. What is real?
954 How do we know it's real? Is existance a part of reality, or vice versa?
955  
956 To put it simply: " Is Canadian Bacon better than Pepperoni?" or something
957 to that effect.

963@Oh, one last note to you Mikey,
964@       Someone once said that only when there is a free press and all men

966@       I thi~k txat this applies to Backwater too. Censorship is an ugly
967@thing, and it does nothing to promote information. Whether a message is 
968@good or bad, usefull or worthless, original or redundant makes no
969@difference. All should have the right to0cee0it. When people tell you that
970@they will leave the board because of certain messages, remind them that they
971@don't have to read them, and that an uncensored board is better in the long
972@run. Besides, (please don't take offense) how do you know ghat we should
973@and shouldn't read? Shouldn't that be our decision? I know that Zod was
974@not putting on anything new, but at least he used the board, and without
975@messages, this board would be nothingOnce again I ask you to please let
976@the }essages run their course. Everyone, I'm sure, would prefer a 
977@redundant board to a regulated one. With censorship, stupidity may be lost,
978@but so eventually goes truth and creativity.
979@       With that said, I suggest that we take a vote 8If this truly is a
980@democratic board) on whether we prefer redundancy and obnoxiousness to
981@censorship. So everone, please say Yae or Nae to censorship at the
