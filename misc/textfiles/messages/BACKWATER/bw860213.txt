21    Somebody was shaking him. He opened his eyes and saw Tariya staring down anxiously at him. Then memory kicked in
22 and he sat up with a jolt. She threw her arms around him. "Oh, God I thought you were dead I pulled you out of the
23 plane and then it exploded and-" He looked at the plane, which was burning merry hell at the end of a ditch the length
24 of a football field. They must have hit at just the perfect angle or they'd have been splattered from hell to
25 breakfast and then some. He must have banged his head, for it surely did hurt.
26    He was about to say something but was interrupted by a roar and the mechanical stutter of a machine gun from above.
27 The dirt exploded at his feet. There were a string of tiny explosions leading away from them. He looked up and saw the
28 fighters circling for another pass.
29    He jumped up, dragging Tariya to her feet. he pushed her towards a large boulder nearby. "Go! Get under cover! I'll
30 take care of them!" She started running and he turned his full attention to the fighters.
31    It took more effort than usual to summon the sword. It crackled ice-blue fire in his hands. They had already turned
32 and were firing again. He stook completely still as slugs pounded the landscape all around him. He followed the lead
33 plane with the tip of his blade. As it passed directly overhead, he let fly with a powerbolt.
34    It was a sight to see. The bolt struck the first ship, pulverizing it. It then branched out, touching the other
35 four simultaneuosly. Five fireballs trailing black smoke slammed into the earth a quarter mile away. He watched them
36 burn for a long moment, then turned and called to Tariya, "Okay, you can come out, now. Fun's over."
37    No response.
38    A worried frown crossing his face, he started over to the rock. Cresting a slight rise, he saw what looked like a
39 pile of old rags collapsed in the center of a large red stain ten yards away from the rock.
40    She hadn't made it.
41    Letting out a yell of horror and anguish, he ran as fast as he could to her. He dropped down on his knees and
42 turned her over gently. He almost screamed when he saw the damage. Her blue outfit was stained a deep purple from
43 waist to shoulders. There was a hole the size of his fist where her stomach should have been. He could actually see
44 clear through. A thin trickle of crimson ran from one corner of her mouth. Miraculously, she was still
45 breathing.
46    Suddenly her eyes opened. They were glazed, unseeing at first, but they finally focused on his face. Her mouth
47 moved, trying to form words. "Didn't move... fast enough..."
48    James was tearing himself apart inside. If there had been a hospital handy, she might have a chance. But they were
49 a hundred miles in the middle of farking nowhere with no transportation or even first aid. There was nothing he could
50 do but try to make her comfortable and sit there and helplessly watch her die.
51    Tears streamed freely down his face. She reached up with a trembling hand and touched his cheek. "Please don't..."
52 she whispered.
53    Suddenly her face twisted into a horrible grimace of agony and he saw something move inside the wound. It took all
54 his willpower not to turn around and throw up. The spasm subsided and she spoke again, weaker this time. "Promise
55 me..."
56    "Anything, babe, anything." He choked out.
57    She grasped his hand, her grip as weak as a newborn baby's. "Destroy the Circle. Stop them... or my family will
58 die..."
59    "I will." he said softly.
60    Her breathing was rapid, her eyes filled with fear. "I'm-I'm trying to be brave, just like you, but I'm
61 scared."
62    He cradled her in his arms. "Don't be scared. Please. It'll be all right, you'll see."
63    She rested a long moment, eyes closed. When she opened them again, they were clear and alert. "James?"
64    "Yeah?"
65    "I didn't want to say this... until I was sure. I can't wait now." She reached up again and caressed his cheek
66 tenderly. "I love you."
67    "I love you, too."
68    She smiled and closed her eyes. She drew a deep breath, and let it out slowly. She didn't draw another. Her hand
69 slowly relaxed in his. He placed a hand hesitanly on her heart, and felt no movement. Her pain was over.
70    He held her lifeless body for a moment, crying pitifully. Sorrow, pain, rage building within until he thought he
71 might explode. Then he laid her down, lovingly, gently.
72    In the city of Shaikhur, a hundred miles away, the citizens paused in their daily routines for a moment and
73 listened. They heard a howl, rolling across the land like thunder, and they shivered despite the heat for it was the
74 sound of a man who had lost his soul.

136 
137    The rain had stopped falling just as the gull winged aircraft stopped climbing, and leveled off.
138 In the distance, towering Cumulus was piled high on the horizon, like puffs of cotton, with golden edges, a halo from
139 the setting sun behind. Above, a hole appeared, and blue sky showed through for a moment.
140 Suddenly, shimmering columns of light appeared-descending straight down, and disappearing into the mist shrouded earth.
141 The cathedral effect, a most magnificent spectacle of nature...
142 
143    A feeling of exhileration swept over the pilot. He pushed in the throttle and unleashed a thousand thundering horses.
144 Of the big radial engine. The quiet throbbing broke into a mighty roar as the propellor bit into the air
145 and the Corsair leapt forward. The pilot swung the eager craft into a graceful chandelle, emulating the lofty
146 dignity of an Eagle in flight.  Leveling off, he executed a series of snap rolls that widened into gentle barrel
147 rolls, the wings describing spiral arcs through the deserted sky.
148 
149    It had been a long time since he had known such elation, and the forgotten words of another pilot echoed from
150 the past. "I have slipped the surly bonds of earth.....reached out and touched the face of God..."
151 Another pilot..who understood...
152 Easing out of the last spiralling roll, he climbed steeply, and eased the stick back further and further.
153 The stall warning indicator chattered intermittently, finally settling to a steady buzz. The plane was
154 buffeted about, the wind tearing at the wings, and as he closed the throttle, the nose dropped earthward
155 in a full stall. Holding back the stick, he kicked the right rudder full on.
156    The big Corsair streaked down in a tailspin, the ground rushing up as the altimiter wound down...
157 
158    Far below, ant-like figures rushed out, onto the tarmac, looking upward, and chattering excitedly in voices
159 unheard ten thousand feet above. Someone was counting, echoing the thoughts of the pilot, as the spinning
160 Corsair plunged earthward...seven...eight...nine...the earth reaching upward to greet it in her final unyeilding grasp.
161 The one called Fellows yelled "My God, he's gonna crash"; Hal, standing beside him just smiled silently.
162    Suddenly, the spinning slowed, and the tail began to drop; the pilot had eased the rudder back.
163 
164 He let go og the stick for a moment, and the well trimmed fighter righted it's self a hundred feet up.
165 The pilot slammed the throttle forward and a Navy blue shadow streaked down, and across the asphalt.
166 The propwash whipped the puddles into mist, drenching the cursing men barely thirty feet below.
167 
168 The pilot whipped into a turn, and greased the plane onto the apron, and taxiied up to the hangar.
169 
170 As the enging coughed to a stop, Delta Five climbed down, and cheerfully greeted the dripping group.
171 "Well, there's no one out there. Reckon we'd better get to work..."    to be continued

174      "Piper? PIPER!" Bard turned and saw the blood on Piper's hands. 
175      An observer would have seen a large vehicle (resembling a Stepvan with
176 no wheels) come to a halt in mid air and settle towards the ground. After 
177 which all would have appeared calm. Inside things were quite different.
178      Bard had helped Piper to one of the bunks and was administering oxygen
179 while trying to figure out what to do next. He just didn't have the skills
180 or equipment to handle major lung damage.

217 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
218   In everyone's life comes a moment when we really face our own mortality.
219 Have you faced yours yet?  Have you stood still, frightened as a field mouse
220 on a clear snowy night when the shadow of a prowling owl obscures the shining
221 moon, scant seconds before the final act of your life?  We live, love and 
222 act throughout most of our lives as though we are invulnerable and immortal.
223 We make decisions (or fail to make decisions) assuming that we are an integral
224 part (and an important part) of the universe.  But for each of us there comes
225 a diamond-edged moment when we stand on the brink of the big dark and know
226 -- know with a terrible certainity -- that not only *CAN* it happen to us,
227 but that it *WILL*, and there is absolutely nothing we can do about it.
228   Oh, some do go into the big dark unconcious.  An unfaced death can claim
229 a victim without his or her knowlege -- but what a waste.  To really live,
230 you must know what not to live entails.  To really love life, you must face
231 its loss.
232   The most common reaction to impending death is denial.  "NO!  There must be
233 some mistake.  You can't mean ME!"
234   The piper felt all this, and a deep betrayal.  His loyal body, that fleshy
235 vehicle that had carried the essential *I* was letting him down.  Each
236 struggled, bubbling breath was a miniature victory.  His concentration was
237 total, not even noticing the bard who lead him to a bunk and lay him down.
238   "Bard"
239   "Yes, piper"
240   "If I don't make it..."
241   "Just relax and keep breathing the oxygen."
242   "Bard ... It's been nice knowing you.  Have an ale for me."
243   Another fit of coughing spewed carmine foam over the clear plastic of the
244 oxygen mask.  It felt almost good as the darkness gathered around the edges
245 of the pipers vision.  He reached up and touched the strong warm hands that
246 were holding his shaking shoulders, covered one with one hand and squeezed
247 it, then relaxed.  The darkness was closing in faster and faster now.  He 
248 heard a giant rushing sound filling him, the last bit of vision was a bright
249 spot like a scene seen through the wrong end of a telescope.
250   The piper's body shuddered and he dropped unconcious on the bunk, a stream
251 of bright red blood pouring from the side of his lax mouth.
252 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

272 existance here on this board means to the cosmos. Boring. Without Grand
273 D and Frank we are nothing. Boring. One man fight the grief of death
274 while another man knocks upon death's doorstep. A woman visits a hallway
275 of life's passageways, opening one door at a time and exploring what
276 happens beyond. Other men continue to fight the never-ending battle of
277 good against evil, battling a nemesis that seems bigger than life. A
278 young woman still learning her own powers meets up with an experienced
279 woman who will teach her new skills and spells. Still another man fights
280 the takeover of his own body by a parasite. One man searches for another
281 on the plain of an alien landscape, mental power being his only guide.
282 Many others read and enjoy the stories told around the eternal fire
283 that is Backwater. And you use one word. Boring. How could you?

287  
288     It's been so long since I learned from Sanderman, Fellows leaned back in
289 his chair and reminisced. Parity, Delta V, George, and Hal were busy briefing
290 each other on what they knew of the current McKane situation. Fellows pretended
291 he was listening, but his mind was far from the green felt-covered table
292 sitting in a cold hanger outside of Juneau Alaska.
293     I remember everything he said so well. His words stick in my mind as if
294 they were spoken yesterday.
295     "You must have deep commitment. You can not survive if you don't commit
296 yourself. You will always be able to win because 100 percent is not enough.
297 Anything less means failure, which is usually a precursor to death in our
298 line of business." His words carved deep marks in Fellows memory.
299     "I'll try my best." Fellows had replied.
300     "No, try not, do, or do not, there is no try." Sanderman said looking
301 straight into Fellows' eyes. "If all you do is try, that will make you fail."
302     "I understand...."
303     "Do you understand Fellows?" Fellows snapped his attention to the men at
304 the table.
305     "Yes, of course" he replied.
306     "Good." Delta V went on. "As you know, some of McKane's former top-level
307 aids have taken the remnants of the organization and trimmed the operation to
308 a more manageable level. That is one reason McKane was always a thorn but
309 never a sword. He had his hands in too many things."
310     Delta, I'm surprised at you. Calling McKane a 'thorn', considering what he
311 did to your family?" Parity focused on his counterpart's face.
312     "I never said thorns couldn't hurt." Delta said quickly, with no visible
313 reaction to Parity's question. "Anyway, it appears a new leader has emerged
314 from the ashes, after a long a brutal power struggle. We don't have a name or 
315 a picture yet, but our surveillance has revealed his existence and his careful
316 plan at taking on the rest of the McKane elite and coming out on top."
317     Parity opened another folder. "Our intelligence, bless Ian's soul, reveal
318 pretty much the same thing. This new person is deep though, because we haven't
319 been able to get close."
320     "Well that will change now." George sat smiling across from Delta. "We
321 have the team that can crack their security and get after this 'son-of-a-
322 McKane and break up the operation once and for all."
323     "You can't ever eradicate evil." Fellows spoke up.
324     "No," George replied, "you right. But we CAN cut away at it so it doesn't
325 hurt so much."
326     Parity touched Fellows' coat sleeve. "I would like to talk to you after
327 the meeting. OK?"
328     "Sure Parity."
329     The meeting went on. Parity and Delta V continued to share information.
330 George continued to contribute. Hal continued to listen. And Fellows continued
331 to remember the past, as vivid as the present, in his current state of mind.

378 Archivists: I just ran my archives thru a little program to total the file size
379 reports from doing DIR, and I came up with 14,144,714 bytes total.  This is with
380 my files which have had the line numbers, first 19 lines, and trainling spaces
381 removed.  It is actually a little less than the reported figure, since I didn't
382 always use the /A copy option.  This works out to 34,166/file, by the way.

384 To KathyD and French Toast,
385     Perhaps I should explain myself a little more fully.  My 'boring' 
386 comment was in no way meant to disparage the Inn, the stories or the
387 writers here.  I have nothing but the highest regard for all of them.  It
388 was meant to indicate more my own state of mind and lack of direction in
389 my writing.  I had meant to welcome the return of an old friend (and
390 adversary), but obviously chose the wrong words.  Those who know me (both
391 friend and foe) know that I am not reluctant to venture my opinion or
392 take issue with opinions of others.... but I hope they also realize that
393 I do not put down the style of efforts of others.
394      Since I'm in hot water already, I may as well turn up the temperature
395 a little.  KathyD and I have disagreed on several issues, but our dis-
396 agreements have always been above board.  She has called me to task, but 
397 also has been big enough to sign her name to her comments.  That earns my
398 respect.  But some here delight in attempting to belittle the work of 
399 others and remain cloaked in anonymity.  You know what I mean, the cutesy
400 one-liner.... the snide comments.  To me that is the lowest of low.  Those
401 attacks show absolutely no class at all.  Alas, too many beginning writers
402 have been discouraged by that type of treatment, and have disappeared from
403 the Inn.  It is the loss of all of us.
404      Hmmmm.... now that I've again earned the title of second-most hated
405 man at the Inn.... I think it's time to return to a deep-lurk mode.
406                                              Dr. Frankenstupe

411 Dr. Frankenstupe: If you go back into your deep-lurk mode the Inn will be back
412 to its normal state of being narrow minded.  People's one liners will always
413 remain unless people like you who are out spoken enough to eliminate them by
414 introducing different points of view.  By letting people know that the only way
415 to communticate what you want to say is not by one liners.  People who have
416 opinions should be able to back them up.  I'm not saying that everyone HAS to
417 believe what is being said, they should only listen.

421   Well, the piper is unconcious, so I can speak for a moment.
422   I fully support Dr. Frakenstupe's comments about "clever one-liners."
423 A clever one-liner is nice, but very few end up being clever.  Most tend to
424 reveal the mental deficiency of the poster.
425   If you have been considering trying to write here or anywhere else, I 
426 offer my encouragement.  It's common to wait with bated breath for all the
427 comments, after all you put your heart and soul into it, didn't you?  You
428 won't get any, unless you've already established contact with others on the
429 board (then you may get some folks in active encouragement mode).
430 -- Oops! orgainization problem with on-line entering in ENTER ONLY --
431 -- Insert the next sentence between "encouragement." and "It's"  --
432 Write something and put it up.
433 -- end of insert--
434   New writers in this mode are particularly vulnerable to those who reveal
435 their own mental and moral deficiencies by sniping from hiding.  Like cowardly
436 jackals, they try to pull down a person who attempts to rise above them.
437 There is only one armor that can shield a would-be writer from these cowardly
438 attacks -- the knowlege that those opinions are worth less than the paucity
439 of intellegence that their posting reveals of the writer.  Know this, really
440 know this in your heart, and you'll be able to brave that first posting.
441   Please don't expect a lot of comment the first time or two.  Most of us
442 have only a limited time to spend here -- we've got a lot to get out in just
443 a short time.  By your third or fourth posting, you'll probably get some
444 feedback.  Remember, we see a lot of folks that post one or two things and 
445 never come back.
446   Join us.  It really gets easier after a while, and we do welcome new folks.

449 Well, it doesn't look very interesting around here, nothing but this stupid
450 yellow fog they call an atmosphere. You got any ideas? #Yes, do you hear that
451 hum in the distance?# Yeah, so what about it? #It's new, it wasn't there before.
452 And in fact, it sounds distinctly like the hum from a interdemensional 
453 transport.# A what? #Oh never mind, you wouldn't understand anyway. Let's 
454 just head in that direction OK?# Alright, but why do we want to go in that
455 direction? #Sigh... because, that hum means transportation. A way off this
456 miserable ball of bleach.# Oh... What if they aren't friendly? #We'll deal 
457 with that when we get there. Would you rather be couped up on this poor
458 excuse for a planet the rest of your life?# Well... ah, no. So what are we
459 waiting for, what's the best way to go? #See that yellow slime on the 
460 ground? just follow it.# Hmmm... that brings something to mind, But I can't
461 think of what it is.... What made  that slime trail anyway? #Oh some local
462 life form, all stomach, and no brain.# Yuck, I hope we don't meet up with
463 him. Oh well, off we go then. Follow the yellow slime road eh? #Yes, follow
464 the yellow slime road.# Bleah, I think I'll call this planet "Ooze" You 
465 really want to follow this yellow slime road? #Yes, it is the easiest way,
466 better then trying to fight through the plants that like to gobble up
467 passers by. So follow the yellow slime road.# Now I remember! "Follow the
468 yellow slime road. Follow the yellow slime road. Follow, follow, follow, 
469 follow, follow the yellow slime road! We're off to see the gizzard, the
470 horrible gizard of Ooze." #Groan... why me?#

480 Omigosh, here everyone is expecting me to enter something intelligible, with
481 midterms tearing, chewing, and swallowing whole large chunks of my time.
482 Haven't been on for several days, all the hints for naught.  Well, to write:
483 +++++++++++++++++++
484 A hop, skip, and a jump later (actually, these were the Hop, Skip, and Jump
485 spells, designed to allow a mage to move atthree times the distance he would
486 under normal circumstances), Milchar found the souce of the low, slightly 
487 irritating hum he had been following.  It came from a large shiny (as much as
488 anything could shine on this dismal planet) transport, made by a rather
489 advanced technology.  Milchar admonished himself for forgetting to use an
490 electro-magnetic finding-spell before.  Too late to think of that now, he
491 thought, and had a minute or so to wonder if the occupant(s) were friendly
492 before the pain hit him.
493 A sharp pain dulling to a throbbing ache made itself felt in the mage's lung,
494 causing him trecheck the spell of protection.  When he was sure that it
495 continued to operate, however feebly (since he had not concentrated on it for
496 quite some time now), he directed his attention again toward the transport.
497 Had the pain been some sort of attack?  A paranoid view, Milchar thought, but
498 thoughts such as that belonged to people who survived.  Still, it was a
499 possibility.
500 Milchar dug about in his robe , again for his pack of cards.  An empathy-spell
501 was called for.  A few short words effected it, and Milchar scanned the vessel.
502 Worry...and pain!  Again pain hflowed into Milchar, iruining his concentration
503 and the spell.  But this time, for a brief moment, Milchar had touched the
504 minds within.  And recognised them.
505 Piper was dying.
506 Milchar shouted a word, and silver fire swept him away.  He hadn't even 
507 bothered with the portion of the casting that dealt with protection from the
508 flames- he had just yelled the essentials.
509 And so he arrived singed, his robe smoking slightly, one corner burning
510 brightly.  He swatted at the flame, speaking not a word to Bard as he saw
511 Piper's blood seeping under a breathing mask.
512 "I hope I remember as much of the heal lore as think I do," he muttered
513 worriedly as he lay his hands upon Piper's chest.
