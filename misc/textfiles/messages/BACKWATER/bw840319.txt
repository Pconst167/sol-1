47 Dear frenchy:
48      I am not a Wassir symp., I do not follow anyones orders.
49 And in fact if Wassir really does have PAM, I most definately
50 do not have any favorable thoughts for this person. I am 
51 currently holding McKane in disfavor for that little incident
52 in Iran when he sold my nephew to the army as cannon fodder.
53 By the way it is Rudolf, not Rudolph (I haven't spelled it that
54 way since '46).
55 Say, Dr. Frankenstupe, maybe we can see about getting a group
56 together to combat this McKane persons lies and inuendos?
57 Besides, I want to get him for what he did to my nephew.

65   The piper stood silent for a while to let the effect of experiencing to
66 realities at the same time reach some sort of equilibrium inside his spinning
67 head.  Finally he could pay some attention to something other than the sensat-
68 ions pounding through his brain.  With the double memories slowly accepting
69 one another, he saw that he was back in the midst of several familiar-seemig
70 companions on a brightly-colored road.
71 "Uugmph"  he remarked brightly.  "Thanks, apprentice.  If my personal reality
72 had been split much longer, my sense of identity would have been totally
73 destroyed.  Have you noticed that the color scheme of the landscape has been
74 changing?"  He waved his hand in the direction of the green fields surrounding
75 the party.  The blue country lay mostly to his back. 
76 "I wish I could remember more Ozography.  I do remember that the country is
77 divided into four lands, each having a dominant color.  The lands all meet
78 in the center of the country where the capital is located.  This small enclave
79 is color coded green.  This brilliant feat of deduction has led me to the 
80 conclusion that we are coming close to our goal."
81 As they were talking, the party had become quite adept at moving in the same
82 direction.  They quickly moved through the land in the direction of a -- first
83 distant, then not so distant -- gleaming green wall.  The party proved itself
84 not quite so adept at stopping as moving however.  When the leading edge of
85 the party walked up to a closed gate in the wall that blocked the road, those
86 persons stopped.  The remainder of the party attempted to continue, jostling
87 those ahead and shortening a few tempers.
88    After the confusion subsided somewhat, the piper glanced to the left f
89 the road.  A small door was just closing in the wall, after a strange figure
90 that had just left.  The piper quickly gained his companions' attention by
91 the brilliant observation, " L .. l.. look!"
92   The figure approaching them was about 5 feet tall and apparently made of
93 solid copper.  It's body was sperical and seemed to be made of two halves
94 joined at the equator which served as the creature's waist.  Two spindly legs
95 issued from the lower hemisphere and two arms from the upper.  A thin neck
96 carried a spere upon which the outlines of a face had been molded, complete
97 with a handlebar mustache.  This (creature?) (contrivance?) topped it's 
98 sartorial splendor with a black derby hat perched precariously on its polished
99 cranium.  With faintly jerky motions, it moved closer to the party.  The piper
100 coul hear a very faint whirr coming from within it.  The creature opened its
101 mouth (migod! it does have a mouth!) and spoke.
102   "well-come to oz gen-tel-men and lad-ies.  i am tik-tok the off-ic-ial 
103 greet-er of oz.  i am a mech-an-i-chal con-tri-vance and work by clock-work
104 and am much less vul-ner-able that meat people to hos-tile ac-tion.  I have
105 been sent by my ruler Ozma, to as-cer-tain your in-ten-tions in this vis-it to
106 our fair land."  This strange person then removed the hat from his polished
107 cpopper head and bowed low to the party.
108 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
109 GIVE ME A BREAK.

135 Well, whadya know!!!!  Just as I was beginning to think the zaniness would
136 never end and there would be no coherence to the incoherence, we find our-
137 selves at Oz and greeted by a cuprous Humptey-Dumpty!  Harrummph!  So
138 much for us slab-sided types.  Nonetheless, I am definitely beginning to
139 think that Leroy McKane sucks air and that that Monsieur d'Autun is his
140 stooge.  I think I would rather take my chances with Humptey-Dumptey here
141 than try to put up with the likes of McKane and his lackeys.  If we hang
142 around here long enough, we might get ballooned back to the Inn (so long
143 as it's not in Kansas), in which case we might be able to handle McKane
144 a little more on his own ground.

146 Dear Rudolf;
147      I'm sorry, I don't get involved in matters such as that.  However, I'm
148 sure that Wassir, Salazar, or most people in the main party traveling through
149 Oz would be most pleased for your assistance.  If you meet Wassir, tell him
150 you're a friend of mine.

155 Consider the art of computer as weapon:
156 It may be broken down into two broad categories, Hackdo and Hackjutsu.
157 The difference between these two ideas may be illustrated thus:
158 the disciple of hackjutsu is the one who develops facility with 
159 computers and uses it to break into someone else's system and causes
160 damage there;
161 the disciple of hackdo develops equal facility but does not engage
162 in invasive/damaging computing. His satisfaction comes not from extreme
163 action, but from knowing that he is capable of such action in self-defense.

173 besides making threats? That's about all you've done since
174 your arrival. I really don't know where McKane is. If you want to
175 get in touch with him, go through that frenchman contact of his. Rumor
176 has it you've already talked to him, so why keep badgering me."
177    "Besides," I added, "in case you don't remember, these people
178 are after me too, although they don't seem to pay much attention to
179 me except to make sure of my location. A bunch of paranoid wackos if

192 NET 1 to all NETWORK members:
193 It seems that McKane has chosen to disregard the PUBLIC warning given
194 by our rivals (the SOCIETY OF ASSASSINS). He is also attempting to tie some 
195 of our operatives to the Albanians.
196 Prepare for active anit-McKane measures.

206 Sail for Amber (words & music: Jordin Kare)
207 We sail for Amber, on the seas beyond the world.
208 Set sail for Amber, on a ship thru Shadow hurled!
209 Kolvir behind us, Cabra passing a-lee,
210 Shadow before us, to the ends of the endless sea.
211 
212 We are the men who sail for Amber,
213 Let our wives and lovers tell,
214 For when the call goes out that we leave at the dawning
215 They are bid but brief farewell.
216 
217 Then we lift our anchor, and slip from the harbor
218 On our journey now begun,
219 And the Unicorn flag flies from our masthead,
220 Proud in the morning sun!
221 CHORUS:We sail for Amber, on the seas beyond the world.
222 Set sail for Amber, on a ship thru Shadow hurled!
223 All hands climb high as we spread our wings,
224 White sail o'er violet seas,
225 And our helmsman steers by the blood of princes
226 As we drift on a Shadow's breeze.
227 
228 But it's watch on watch when the storm clouds gather
229 And the thunder fills the fills the sky.
230 Before the gales that roar from reality's rim
231 Down the world-shifting winds we fly!
232 CHORUS
233 'Til at last we spy, on shifting horizon,
234 Some strange and foreign land,
235 And the wreck of war, or a virgin forest,
236 Or the towers of a city grand.
237 
238 Then it's gold for grain, red wine for rubies;
239 Barter, buy, and sell,
240 'Til our holds stand full and full and the salt sea calls us
241 With a cry that we know full well.
242 
243 
244 So from port to port we wander Shadow,
245 Steered by our captain's will,
246 And a hundred legends behind us gather
247 Of a ghost ship wandering still.
248 CHORUS
249 Though tomorrow's voyages call to our souls,
250 And will not be long denied,
251 Yet tonight our sails seek home and haven ---
252 And our hulls a familar tide.
253 
254 So we steer for the center of the Universe, laden
255 With the wealth of a thousand lands,
256 To the hurricane's core, where, calm in Chaos,
257 Amber forever stands!
258 CHORUS
259 And at last, when Kolvir clears the horizon,
260 Comes our lookout's joyful cry,
261 And the gulls of the harbor rise in greeting --
262 Gray wings in an evening sky.
263 
264 And we pledge our lives, as we moor 'neath the mountain,
265 Here at the heart of all,
266 While we've water and wind, sail searoom,
267 Amber shall never fall!
268 We sail for Amber, on the seas beyond the world.
269 Set sail for Amber, on a ship through shadow hurled!
270 Kolvir before us, Cabra to windward be,
271 Shadow behind us -- always behind us -- waiting behind us
272 To the ends of the endless sea!

282 Attention Earthlings:
283   
284 While monitoring earth communcations techniques we chanced upon this media
285 I am somewhat confused.  Computers on our planet Mxyzptlkizar are logical
286 and predictable.  This technique for public communications using the 
287 computer is totally out of our realm of reality.  We are not sure if this
288 can be allowed.  We will be reporting our findings to our Imperial Megyesi
289 at our earliest convenience.  This may take a few lunar rotations however
290 and if the reality levels of this media assume normal paramaters the report
291 may not be necessary.  I would not want to incure the wrath of the Imperial
292 Megyesi.  As you earthlings would say "A word to the in intelligent should

305       "Well, Johnathon, it shouldn't be much..."
306 My words are cut short as we come to a green wall. 
307 "Good job," sneered Johnathon Chance, "Where have you taken us to? Get
308 us out of this one."
309 "I told you I knew the way," I say as a move a shrub aside."Walla. Open
310 entrance heading straight where we want to go--wizard's lair."
311 After about 10 feet of tunnel, we come to an opening right in the Wizard's
312 lab. My eyes wondor over to the side near us. Floating mid-air is the jewel!
313 "This will be cake. I'll just wondor over and grab it."
314 Before Johnathon can object, I'm already moving silently across the lab.
315 Smiling with my ingeniousness, I grab the jewel and tuck it into my robe.
316 Krrrrraaaaazzzzzzaaaaaapppppp!
317 The Wizard didn't think so much. It appears as if he petrified me. Last
318 I checked, The only way out of this one is dousing in frsh squeezed O.J.
319 coming from an orange from Uganda. As I drift off into sleep, I try and

465 UPI - KANSASA large structure bearing the name, "Backwater
466 Inn," was found deposited in a cornfield 24 miles north
467 of Topeka.  I was apparently dropped there by the largest
468 tornado to rip through Kansas since the filming of a
469 Judy Garland film some 45 years ago.  One girl suffered
470 minor head injuries in the first tornado.  No persons
471 were found in the building, but, by the number of ales
472 half consumed inside it is estimated that there were 
473 approximately 26 people inside when the tornado touched
474 down in Portland, Oregon some four days ago.
475 In an apparently related story,  FBI and Federal
476 Marshals have reason to believe that a possible kidnap
477 victim (identified only as Pam) could be in the vicinity
478 of the relocated Inn.

480 Commander: if the Bard is really in posseession of AKKA, I would suggest
481 that you don't cross him.  Charles Anthar (of the Green Hall, you
482 may remember), while incarcerated on Pluto, forced the Emperor
483 Adam the Third to abdicate and restore democracy to the System.  He did this using the simple device called AKKA.
484 
485 Bard: are you an ancestor of Aladoree Anthar, or a minion of
486 Eric Ulnar?  In fact, since there seems to be such doubt about your
487 true identity, perhaps you're Eric himself!
488 I manage to follow most of your references, but what is the
489 origin of the BOLO?  I know I've read it somewhere, but cannot remember
490 where.  I though Dorsai, or Pournelle, but could find them in neither
491 place.  Enlighten me, Oh plier of words!

496 Bard:  Please be careful where you point that thing.  Yes I vaguely remember
497 AKKA (enough to be impressed if that is necessary).  Please don't point it down
498 as I would like a place to stand if it accidentally goes off.  Up is not too 
499 good either -- I never did have a hankering to see a nova first hand.
500   The copper being interrupted.  "ex-cuse me gen-tel-men but my gracious ruler
501 wish-es to know your in-ten-tions.  we have no par-ti-cu-lar fear of any out-
502 side weapons as our par-tic-u-ar re-al-
503 i-ty is main-tained by the be-lief of 
504 mill-ons of litt-le chil-dren.  This pow-er-ful force is quite en-ough to be
505 proof against a few dis-org-an-ized com-pu-ter us-ers!".  The copper being 
506 drew himself upward and seemed to be looking down his copper-colored nose at
507 the party.  "as a mat-ter of fact, if it were up to me, you would be ap-ply-ing
508 for en-trance to the city at the ser-vants door!"
509   The piper turned to the meatal man and spoke, "Please excuse our unorganized
510 appearance and actions, Tic-Tok.  I, myself, have been a follower of the Oz
511 books in childhood.  Their recollection is somewhat garbled in my memory, 
512 however.  Our intentions as a group are honorable -- we seek to find the source
513 of an incursion of high-tech weaponry into the placid reality of the inn we 
514 often frequent.  However (glancing at the bard) we sometimes forget our purpose
515 and get sidetracked into other pursuits.  We were attempting to consult the
516 wizard as to how to find and put a stop to such incursions into formerly 
517 peaceful surroundings.  Many members of our party seem to be exhibiting tenden-
518 cies toward violence that normally do not surface.  In addition, I believe that
519 some others whose motives may not be so pure are gathering like vultures who
520 surround a thirstly man in the desert.  Their purpose seems to be to incite
521 violence and feed off the leavings.  I and I hope most of the other more
522 peacably inclined persons still hope to accomplish our original purpose ---
523 MAKE THE BACKWATER SAFE FOR INANITY!"
524   With these words, the piper struck an impressive pose, his pipes slung under
525 his left arm with the drones horizontal and pointing forward, head thrown back
526 and gazing upward, his right arm held up and forward, forefinger extended.

535 It was a queit spring afternoon, and the Inn was empty save for the Innkeeper himself as the robed man swept in 
536 and quickly shut the door on the still-chilly air outside.
537 "Ah! It's good to be back! I'll bet you don't even remember me. I was here but once before, a couple months back."
538 "There IS something familiar about your face. Weren't you with that party that went off to stop the weapons-
539 smugglers? It's been Much quieter in the Inn since that belligerent lot took off."
540 "Why, no sir. I've been here but once. I broke into a political argument with a love sonnet I'd just written.
541 When they threw things at me afterwards, I chose not to return. I heard that things had changed, so I have returned."
542 "That's funny, I thought you were the one who got all of them all excited to go in the first place."
543 "Nope. Got the wrong fellow. Now, may I please have seven ales? A Poet gets thirsty, you know."

547 "Hey! Ninja! The Wizard is not a violent person. He wouldn't hurt someone for just grabbing a jewel hanging in 
548 front of their face. This's probably just some sorcerous form of hypnotism, meant to hold you here. Try letting the
