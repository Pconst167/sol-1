84 <_>--> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES, BUT IT'S POINTED AT YOU!!!
85 "AT THE RISK OF MIOSQUOTING SOMEONE, I AM *NOT* A HERO!," VANDERVECKEN
86 CRIES. HOWEVER, WHEN THERE'S A PARTY TO BE FOUND, IT DOESN'T MUCH MATTER
87 WHO THE LOCALS THINK YOU ARE.  AND THUS, VANDERVECKEN FINDS HIMSELF ONCE
88 AGAIN AT A BIZARRE LITTLE PLACE WITH A DOOR LABELED "7-17."  UNFORTUNATELY,
89 THE INN IS A PLACE that qualifies as more than passing strange... so 
90 strange in fact, that a 6' tall cremlin can get lost quite easily, *even*
91 with a xylophone and speaker amp.  And so our hero (?!) finds himself
92 once again ordering an Irish Coffee and wondering where he is (obviously
93 NOT Hell, he'd been there once, and it was boring -- too easy to take
94 over!).  On the other hand, last time he asked someone the locals took
95 exception to it ... something about shouting too loud.
96 --------------====================>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>-T.R.
97   ARRRGGGHHHHH!!!!
98  Bright Blue of energy and then the bluye of sky above and the green of
99 earth and plants below.  The guidence is out, right...  side slip?
100  The horses and other, stranger mounts in front of the Inn look at the
101 strange craft landing beside them, and they sniff the strange smell of the
102 rider.  The rider dismounts his 'stead?' and enters the building,  sighting
103 an empty table, he heads for it, removing his riding healmet to reveal a
104 cascade of bright orange hair and green eyes with vertical slit pupils.
105  The gloves come off of the hands to reveal fingers with retractable claws
106 and a light tan fur covers the whole of visible flesh.
107   Signaling to the barmaid the stranger holds up one hand with the thumb
108 raised, one bear.  As the bear arives he offers a disk of silver with no
109 markings as payment.  Listening to the ebb and flow around him the language
110 of these people becomes more intellegable, though it is apparent that 
111 several tounges are in use, the common tounge is familliar enough to use.
112   So he sits at the table and wounders about home, time, space and the 
113 alternatives to events...

141       WAS NOT THIS LOVE INDEED?
142    WE MEN MAY SAY MORE, SWEAR MORE, BUT INDEED, OUR SHOWS ARE MORE THAN WILL,

156 (* IIIIIIIVVVIVIIVIIIIX (*) IXVIIIVIIVIVIVIIIIII *)
157 The dancer had moved quickly from the door to the crone's favorite
158 spot by the hearth.  Too late she realized that she had been careless-
159 -too many people might associate that location with the crone, and
160 seeing another person wearing the crone's clothing might start them
161 wondering about the connection between the two.  Her mind raced with
162 possible explanations she could offer if anyone bothered to question
163 her  They had traded clothes(?).  Ridiculous.  She had found them(?).
164 Who would choose to wear these rags if they had anything better.
165 Finally she decided to just brazen it out--she had had quite a few
166 years experience dealing with the questions of the curious, this new
167 problem wasn't any worse than some of the others had been.
168      She glanced around at the crowd, looking for any familiar faces.
169 Huh!  There was the Philosopher, the man with no memory.  Who was that
170 next to him, the one looking at her speculatively?  She looked away
171 quickly.
172      Nothing was going to be accomplished by just sitting here.  She
173 had no money, but that would be easy enough to obtain.  If only the
174 barkeep still had her tambourine--it was time for dancing!
175      Getting up quickly, she sauntered over to the bar thinking about
176 which dance routine she felt in the mood for--the ragged clothing was
177 a distinctly wrong for some of the numbers--it would ruin the
178 atmosphere the particular dance was supposed to establish.
179 Hmm...rags...bare feet...uncombed hair...Cinderella?  No, too
180 wholesome.  Aha, she thought triumphantly, a slave girl dreaming of
181 freedom.  That's the one!
182      The barkeep was a stranger, not the one who had been working the
183 night of the dancer's previous visit.  But he obliged her request and
184 rummaged through the misplaced and forgotten items behind the bar
185 until he found her tambourine.  When he handed it to her, she asked if
186 it would be all right to provide a little entertainment for the crowd.
187 "Nothing too lewd." he warned suspiciously.  "There are all sorts of
188 people in here tonight--I don't want any of 'em bothered or
189 complaining."  She smiled sweetly at him.  "I will do nothing you
190 couldn't take your Mother to see," she reassured him.  "That is if you
191 even had a mother," she continued under her breath as she turned away.
192      She found a slightly open spot towards the center of the room,
193 crouched down in a position of lowly submission, and gave a loud,
194 sustained shake of the tambourine.  When she was sure that she had
195 gained at least the attention of those standing nearest to her, she
196 started gently tapping her leg with the tambourine in a slow, rhythmic
197 beat.  Using some of the changer mental imaging, she envisioned
198 herself as abused slave who is tyrannized by her jealous mistress, and
199 who is dreaming of her homeland and freedom.  And so the dance began.

204 Max and I watched as the lithe woman went to the barkeep and 
205 asked him something.  He ducked behind the bar and came up with
206 a tambourine, all intact.  She took it and appeared to thank him,
207 then went to the center of the largest open space in the room.
208 She started a dance, and immediately I was filled with a sense
209 of yearning for freedom.  
210 What power in a dance.  I turned to ask Max if he felt it to, 
211 but the expression he wore gave me pause.  Completely mezmerized.
212 What power.  What sort of sapient form is this?
213 And what had become of the old woman?!?

235 So, in the midst of creating something  new, I a m called away, and now what 
236 little I had left is gone.  Perhaps this is Entropy.  (Speaking of Entropy, 
237 where did our little embodiment of the  whole concept disappear to?)  But no, I
238 would suspect that it was mearly Mikey  deleting it because I did not get the
239 chance to finish it.  Ah, well, I can   only try to send it again, in the hopes
240 that it will be approved of.  It is the same name, but an all together different
241 yarn.
242 :::::=====:::::=====:::::=====
243      Much time had passed since Zephyr  had dared to enter the Inn.  Witxh the
244 adventures he had had with b, he had  forgotton this little corner of the 
245 known dimensions.  But now he had returned, doubting that anyone would know that
246 he had once been...  something else.
247      But with great resolve, he decided not to let such worries upset him.  He
248 was hear for one reason and one reason  alone.  It was to try to gather up the 
249 tattered fragments of his reputation    and quietly depart once and for all 
250 from the lives of those who lived within the Inn.
251      His hands trembling, he pushed at  the door, feeling the wood dig into 
252 his skin.  It had been splintered and   broken by countless attacks, from 
253 nature and those who would try to gain  entrance and were unwelcome.  He stopped
254 now to wonder if HE would be welcome.   Oh, he had tried before, but had never
255 met with any success.
256      Cautiously, he peered into the room.  Yes, some remnants of what he had
257 once been still dwelled somewhere in    the darkest corners of his heart.  He
258 had tried to forget them, but still     they remained, like rthorns digging into
259 him until they drew blood.
260      But the adventure with Zeb had     changed all that.  He had seen what
261 the future held, and he had seen the    stars themselves.  With his homeworld  
262 now liberated, the Guardians saw fit    to allow him to use his manifested    
263 abilities to journey forth once more.
264      Of course, his power was not the   only change.
265      A blast of smoke hit him square    in the face, and as he coughed and 
266 wheezed, he tried to look through his   teary eyes to see inside.  Waving a
267 hand in front of him, he made his way   blindly to the table he had once known
268 so well.  Yes, he thought, stroking the good, strong wood, and smelling the 
269 scent of pine in the air..
270      He sat down at the table, and decided to actually talk to some of the 
271 residents.  In his earlier incarnation, he had mnever actually communicated with
272 anyone.  But now that would change.
273      Even he was startled wihen he said  he wanted something to drink.  
274 
275      The bartender knew not who this    stranger was, nor did he care.  This
276 fellow called himself "Zephyr", and a   few of the patrons reacted to the name
277 rather negatively.  He couldn't understAnd why.  There wasn't anything 
278 wrong that he could see about the guy.  As far as the bartender was concerned,
279 all thAt mattered was that this human's money was good.
280 =====:::::=====:::::=====

340 Hammond Armour gazed at the retreating form of Malys Sheperd.  Her fierce
341 competence and humorless devotion to his needs made him uncomfortable.
342 It was often useful to have power, but it made people react to you un-
343 necessarily.  It was the rare man who could just be with him without
344 trying to compete or grovel and the rare woman who didn't become either
345 seductive or resentful.  He valued those few people he could be him-
346 self with.  The letter from Albania was a report on state-run newspapers
347 and book dispensaries, but it had been so heavily censored as to be
348 undecipherable.  Who would have ordered such a report?  Aha. Among his
349 few true friends was a maverick researcher in his own employ.
350    He decided to avoid the fanfare of a walk through the front office.
351 In his private bath, he changed into rumpled corderoy pants and a bulky
352 wool jacket, then charged down the back stairs.  At the bottom was a
353 beaten black one-speed bike. He unlocked it, put the chain around his
354 neck, and pedaled off.  "How ironic," he thought, "That the freedom
355 touted in car ads is so much better to be found on this humble vehicle."
356 He proceeded to the Bohemian section of Northwest Portland.

360 The dancer ended her performance in the same crouched position in
361 which the dance had begun.  Coins of varying size and metallic hue
362 covered the floor around her, thrown by appreciative Inn patrons.  The
363 dancer felt physically drained but spiritually fulfilled by her dance,
364 this more than the applause of strangers, was the reward she desired,
365 the inner knowledge that she had danced well.
366      She began to pick up the scattered coins and pile them in a small
367 heap in front of her.  There were more than would fit in her torn
368 pockets; perhaps the barkeep would exchange the many small coins for a
369 few of larger denomination.  Before she had a chance to ask, someone
370 wearing a brilliant blue skirt and emerald green cloak stopped
371 directly in front of her.  She looked up and saw that the skirt was
372 topped with a golden tunic which matched the golden feathered cap on
373 woman's head.  The costume by itself would have seemed terribly gaudy,
374 but the bearing of the woman wearing it gave its ostentation a royal
375 dignity.
376      As the dancer's gaze met that of the woman, she inclined her head
377 in a slight bow and spoke.  "If I may, I would like to speak with you.
378 Would you share my table and partake of the light meal which I have
379 ordered?"
380      The woman's dark eyes expressed only gentle inquiry, none of the
381 avid curiosity which too frequently spurred invitations from people
382 who had seen her dance.  "I would," the dancer replied, "but, as you
383 can see, I have my earnings to gather up first."  She gestured to the
384 coins which still littered the floor around her.
385      "If you would not object," the woman responded, "my servant,
386 Yuan, could do that while you rest.  That is, if you would allow.  I
387 can assure you that he is honest."
388      The dancer then noticed a small boy, dressed all in brown from
389 his feathered cap to his boots, standing slightly behind the woman,
390 and peering around his mistresses skirt at her.  When the dancer
391 smiled at him, he blushed and quickly looked down at his toes.  She
392 looked up again at the woman and said, still smiling, "He doesn't look
393 like a desperate bandit.  I believe that I can trust him with my
394 money.  I will join you."
395      The woman stood back to give the dancer room to get up, and then
396 led the way to a table in a far corner of the room.  The aroma from
397 the several platters of food on the table reminded the dancer than she
398 had not eaten in many hours and that she was famished.  Seeing her
399 eyeing the food avidly, the woman indicated that she was to help
400 herself.  "Please, eat your fill," she said.  "It will give me time to
401 tell you a story which I think just might interest you."

408      As he watched the conclusion to the dance, Zephyr was reminded of his home
409 world, and of the celebration that had  followed after his people had been made
410 free from the cruel hand of tyranny.
411      It had not been an easy choice, but he had decided that his world was not
412 for him.  Now that he could dwell in the world of humankind, he chose to take
413 advantage of it.  But he had still retained a few abilities that he had
414 discovered on his adventure with Zeb.
415      From out of a leather pouch tied   with frayed brown string, he took a few
416 coins and held them in his hand.  His   grey eyes focused on them, as he 
417 concentrated on every portion of ttheir  being, both real and conceptual.  Soon
418 he had only the coins pictured in his   mind, and all else was a meaningless    blurr.
419      With a small spark, the two coins  became four, and the four eight.  Yes,
420 eight would be `enough for now, and there was no need to exert himself any 
421 further.  Focusing and Magnifying took  a lot out of him.  At least these were  
422 solid objects.  What really strained him was when he had to work with cthe more
423 conceptual objects, like emotioon or
424 power.
425      But then, in all his travels, and  everywhere he had visited, power was 
426 the one thing man sought to magnify.    None were content with what they had.
427 Zephyr had learned, when his abilities  had manifested through the GCSSO's
428 training,  that he needed little more   power than what he had to survive.  He
429 would never have to do without the      things one needed to live, and living
430 comfortably was all that Zephyr really  needed.
431      Resalizing that he was staring off  into space, Zephyr coughed, smiled,
432 and tried as hard as he could to sink   down through the wooden chair.

444 I  pulled  harder at the door.  Making my fingers thin and slender I  tried 
445 sliping them around the edge,  but the fit was tight,  I could only get the 
446 barest possible hold.  But it was enough.  Slowly and methodically I ran my 
447 fingers around the edge, freeing each microcosmic particle as I went. Years 
448 and  eons  passed as I continued my work.  Or was it only a  few  hours.  I 
449 cannot  tell.  I continued my slow and tedious work.  As each particle  was 
450 freed,  it  sprang  from  my  fingers to spin about the  door  in  an  ever 
451 increasing  circle.  The light was getting brighter and brighter  until  it 
452 became  difficult  to see what I was doing.  I continued to work mostly  by 
453 feel.  After a very long time,  the length of which I was not certain.  The 
454 last of the material was removed from around the frame.  I only had to open 
455 the door now and I would be away from this mindless chaos.   I grasped  the 
456 handle and pulled...  it refused to move.  I tried again.  Still it did not 
457 budge.  I raised my fist and struck the door again and again. And it echoed 
458 with a hollow 'boom',  'boom',  'boom'.  "Let me out of here" I cried,  and 
459 beat  furiously at the door until my hands hurt so much that I could do  so 
460 no  more.   I slumped back,  my head in my hands and cried.  Great pools of 
461 water formed from the tears that ran down my face.  For a very long time  I 
462 just sat there and cried.  In time the tears subsided, and I began to think 
463 again.  My previous efforts were not entirely in vain, it only seemed so on 
464 the  surface.  Now the door was bathed in a glowing ball of particles  that 
465 spun  around  it.  I reached out through the cloud and touched it,  it  was 
466 still there and still closed.

482 Hammond swung off the ancient black bike with a flourish.
483 Flushed with exhilaration after his ride, during which he'd
484 screamed at a loutish Honda driver, causing said driver to roll
485 down his window, allowing Hammond to pedal up beside him and shake
486 him by his lapels while doing his Crazed-Hippy-Drug-Addict imitation,
487 so surprising him that he was still sitting in the intersection be-
488 tween Lincoln High and the MAC Club while Hamm was zooming across
489 Burnside thinking, "That'll either teach him to stop sideswiping bikes
490 or to do it only when he can complete the kill."  
491        The green Victorian on Trinity Place was imposing if one
492 didn't look too closely at the lead pipe propping up the curving bal-
493 ustrade or the sagging gutter around the turret or any of the hundreds
494 of quick-fix jobs that held the old glory together.  Margot Jones oc-
495 cupied the front lower flat.  Hamm shouldered his bike and sprinted
496 up the steps, rapping on the window as he passed.  Ms. Jones opened
497 the door before he could ring the bell, propped the bike tenderly
498 against the old deco wallpaper and ushered him into her quarters.
499 "Got my Albania report, eh?" Her short tousled hair caught the sun
500 and her blue eyes glowed as she searched through bundles of papers
501 oblivious to the effect she was having on Hamm who was doing his
502 little Margot mantra. "She's only 20. You're nearly 40. You don't need
503 complication. You NEED her objectivity. You need it far more than
504 pleasure."  In fact, it was Margot's work that kept his enterprises
505 from a moral bankruptcy that his accountants couldn't fathom.  It was
506 she who had uncovered the obscure link to organized crime in a seem-
507 ingly innocent cement contracting deal.  It was she who found the
508 dog-food porno-racket connection, who uncovered the Soviet mole steal-
509 ing technical secrets from Armour shipyard, who warned Hammond about a
510 Wall Street prodigy who was on the news in handcuffs last night, and
511 she who kept him from investing in any number of sleazy, if profitable
512 ventures. She was thoroughly unimpressed with Hammond's wealth, power,
513 or personal charm, and seemed to be primarily motivated by her own 
514 strong vision of the way the world should work.
515 "Here," said Margo settling into a deep armchair with a sheaf of 
516 papers.  In an enormous t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, she looked like
517 a stern little elf.  Hammond prepared to be humbled.
518 "As you know," her searing glance implied that he didn"t which was 
519 true, "Albania is an unappealing little country.  It is, except for
520 Romania, the only country in the world where typewriters have to be
521 registered like weapons.  It is the only sattelite nation to have bro-
522 ken relations with the USSR on the grounds that, since de-Staliniza-
523 tion, the Soviets weren't represive enough.  The Soviets were unchar-
524 acteristically eager to let her go. From 1944 until his death in April
525 1975, Albania was ruled by Enver Hoxha who kept her oppressed and
526 isolated.  It was expected that his death would relax the government
527 and that Italy and the USSR would rush to dominate her.  But no one
528 seems to WANT to step in.  Even the US has not infiltrated or tried to
529 sway her although her position is geographically strategic."
530 She stopped. A response was in order. "So?" wavered Hamm.
531 "SOOOOOO!! *WHY* are you trying to build a car factory there?"

543 The dance had finished, and Max shook his head slowly.  "That was some spell,"
544 he intoned, "Not sexual, nor really sensual.  But there was a power there that
545 seemed to take me back to a previous time.  Sort of like Deja Vu on a grand
546 scale."
547 "are you OK now ?",I asked, concerned for my friend.
548 "Oh yes, fine.", he replied, "But I wonder where I have seen her before."
549 "I think that there must be some connection between her and that old fortune
550 teller that was in hear before.  You know, the old hag who read your future just
551 before that rude gentleman came by ?"
552 "She does seem to be wearing her clothes, do you suppose that she killed and
553 robbed the old bat?"
554 "I think I shall go and find out."
555 So saying, I stood up and walked over to the table where the dancer was 
556 lack of a better phrase) pigging out.  "Greetings, that was quite a performance."
557 She looked up at me and smiled.  A carefully controlled smile, not friendly,
558 yet sincere.  "Thank you.  And thank you for the coins I saw you toss."
559 "My pleasure.  May I ask you a private question?"
560 "I may not answer."
561 "That would be answer enough.  Where did you obtain the clothing that you are
562 wearing?"

585      The dancer's benefactress was extremely displeased by the
586 interruption.  Particularly since it appeared to cause the dancer a
587 certain amount of discomfort, which she was trying to hide behind a
588 guise of cool nonchalance.  This was not to be tolerated.  It was of
589 prime importance that the dancer be relaxed and receptive to her
590 story, the cultural heritage of her people could very well depend on
591 it.  It was time to intervene.
592      "Excuse me, Sir," she began.  "I am T'Chree, Princess Royal of
593 the Kingdom of Aviana, and Special Ambassador for his Majesty, King
594 Avianus.  The dancer and I were conducting business of importance to
595 the kingdom when you interrupted us.  I must ask you to allow us to
596 continue our discussion in private."
597      She risked a quick glance at the dancer to see how she was
598 reacting to this particular bit of news.  Good, she was maintaining
599 her calm facade.  The explanations could be made later, right now she
600 had to get rid of this snoop.  T'Chree, looking imperiously down her
601 aquiline nose with as much hauteur as she could muster, returned her
602 gaze to the man standing at their table.  "Well . . .?"
603      The man was completely taken aback.  Obviously his attention had
604 been focused entirely on the dancer, and he had hardly been aware of
605 her presence at all.  "Uh . . . pardon, Your Highness, I was just
606 curious about how the dancer happened to be wearing the same raggedy
607 get-up as an old woman who was a regular customer in here until a few
608 weeks ago.  She seems to have just disappeared into thin air.  You can
609 understand why a person could start wondering."
610      This one is certainly tenacious, T'Chree thought.  The dancer
611 wisely was staying out of the matter, sitting there eating as if
612 T'Chree and the frocked man were talking about something entirely
613 unrelated to her.
614      "I see," T'Chree answered him.  "And you have a special . . .
615 interest in this old woman.  Was she a relative, or . . . a dear
616 friend perhaps?"  Her inference was not complimentary.
617      "That old bag?  You must be kidding."  The man was appalled by
618 the thought.
619      "Well, if you have no real interest in the welfare of the old
620 woman, then I must conclude that you are merely using that story as a
621 ruse to get better acquainted with this young woman.  Now, be off,
622 before I call the Innkeeper and complain to him that you are harassing
623 us, you masher!"
624      With one final glare at the man, T'Chree turned her complete
625 attention to the dancer.  "I'm sorry, my dear," she began.  "I think I
626 should begin again.  That boorish man caused me to disclose
627 information which I was going to include, but further along in my
