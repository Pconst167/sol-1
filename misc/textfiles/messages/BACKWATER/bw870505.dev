 32 are unprotected before trying to change them.  Mikey's disk header is
 33 created with the protect bit set on each line.
 34 It was good to see you around again at the Social!  I'm sorry that I had to
 35 leave almost as soon as you arrived.  There will be other times.
 36 Mike:  Still collisions, with both 8250's out and both IRQ enable lines tied
 37 high.  (Sigh).  I'll have to wait 'till I can get rid of the card.

 43 SILLY question here, but what are the precedant "$"s doing on lines 1-19 on
 44 DB?  Here's another one:  Why isn't BWII "cycled" in the same manner as BW?
 45 (ie: DB-->archive  DA-->DB  'fresh'-->DA)
 46 Leonard: Talk about dead?  Tell me about it--I want to contribute to the
 47 deadness by killing a few of those ******* twits on the other side.  Grr!

 51 Hmmmm, no headers here for some reason. Sigh..... something went wrong...
 52 Why the "$"? that indicates that the line is protected and cannot be changed,
 53 deleted, or killed. As to why no cycling of disks here as with BWI, that is
 54 because the data file definition has changed between "disks" and the old
 55 data can no longer be run here because it doesn't fit the newer format.
 56 The old disks are available in the archives though.

 58 If I can get this blasted modem interface working right, I'm shooting
 59 for midnight this saturday to bring the system on line.
 60 and here's a side thought for you, how about a "wake" for BW after
 61 it is put to rest?

 68 CM: KI still on the drawing board... (*sigh*).  It seems there isn't any
 69 efficient way to clean up things after marking the line KIlled, so brute force
 70 will probabaly be the solution.  KIlling sessions and line ranges will be
 71 slow.  Hopefully we won't need it much.
 72 What are you changing the LEVEl password to if you go on-line Saturday?

 75 Hmm, still having header problems.... rats. I wonder what is wrong?
 76 For now I'll be changing it to "pass wind" I still have modem control
 77 problems to work out, and the headers seem to be giving fits here.
 78 Milch: I've added in Unprotect and protect commands and a hack into the
 79 del and undel to support it, but it still needs work there seems to be
 80 a bug of sorts in both commands. Oh well. That's what i get for a quick 
 81 1/2 hours worth of hacking...
 82 I'm going to be concentrating my energies on getting the thing to
 83 work fully with the modem this week in the hopes of getting it on-line 
 84 saturday night.
 85 Any ideas on the wake?
 86 *********************** CM  5/11/87   7:00pm *********************
 87 So *that*'s the problem... I've trying to find things using the SE commands.
 88 No wonder I couldn't find anything. But I could have sworn I tried BO and got

 99 I wonder if I have a 3x5 card to make Headers appear?  :-)
100 Mikey: The same hack in DElete and UNdelete to check for protected lines 
101 needs also be put into KIll.  (Why does UNdelete check protection?  What use
102 would a deleted, protected line be?)

104 ***************************************************************
105 My first thought was "protect isn't much use on deleted lines", but
106 after thinking about it, there might be a case where a "god level"
107 delete occured that was desired to stay deleted possibly so that 
108 it won't show to those who aren't in the inner circle, but not
109 allow a undelete on the stuff. I can't think of a specific instance
110 where that might be, but it doesn't take much to disallow undelete
111 on protect, and in fact if we merge the code together it might be
112 easier to code. As for why it is in there in the first place...
113 simple, delete was coded first, and then undelete was created by
114 copying the delete procedure. Thus......

116 Well guys, only two more days until the big one!
117 On saturday May 16th at midnight BWI will no longer exist.

131 about lines > 80 chars? (not that there are many)
