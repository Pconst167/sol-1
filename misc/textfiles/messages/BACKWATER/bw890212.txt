 24 Well, looks like I made it to the top. Vision, I liked your poetry on the
 25 dragon. Has an optomistic air to it. You know your already ahead of me on
 26 the total messages/calls column on the dragon. Gee, I'm going to have to 
 27 ty to think of somthing to post over there! :-)
 28  
 29 to the story I guess.
 30  
 31 "I had thought I heard the sounds of Elves as my men and I approached this
 32 road house. How did you come to know there ways so well?" Sir Alex asked
 33 Moric.
 34  
 35 "I am the last of my line. There was many years ago a town established on
 36 the border of the Elven woods. My great grandparents settled there along 
 37 with many others. This town acted as a trading post between the Elves and
 38 the lands of man. It was not at all uncommon for there to be several elves
 39 living in the village in those days." Moric paused staring into the fire.
 40  
 41 "Then during the days of my fathers youth a great war started amoungst the 
 42 Humen kingdoms that surrounded the forest. The village stayed neutral in all
 43 of this and the Elves as they are wont to do took little interest.
 44 It was a long and cruel war. 15 years it lasted according to the Elves. 
 45 Trade suffered greatly and one by one the people of the village left as
 46 they watched their livelihood slowly slipping away. 
 47 "
 48  
 49 "By the time the war was over only my father and I remained."
 50  
 51 "And what of your mother?" Asked Sir Alex.
 52  
 53 "I don't know, my father would never say. I have very vague memories of her,
 54 But I'm not sure that they are more then my longings taking on a phantom
 55 form that has no basis in fact."
 56  
 57 "I see. Why did your father chose to stay."
 58  
 59 "He told me that he'd rather live amoungst the Elves. He loved Elven Music,
 60 Dances and song. He was very well respected amoungst them."
 61  
 62 "But what of you? wasn't it cruel to force you to live away from all of
 63 humenkind?"
 64  
 65 "I was not forced, I chose to stay. All the family I had was my father. 
 66 When he died the Elves took me in. "
 67  
 68 "And so now you've decided to see the world?"
 69  
 70 "Yes, Things move so slowly in the forrest.." He answered wistfully.
 71  
 72 "I know of many of the events you speak of. I myself fought in the great
 73 war when I was not much older then you. I was lucky enough to come in at
 74 the end of that ugly time."
 75  
 76 "Sir everything is in place and we have set up a watch." one of sir
 77 Alex's retainers inserted into the lull.
 78  
 79 "Very good, We'll be leaving soon after dawn. Be sure everyone knows that."
 80  
 81 "Yes sir." He replied walking towards the door.
 82  
 83 "We are going to the city of borant, You are welcome to accompany us if you
 84 wish."
 85  
 86 Moric thought for a moment... "I would be hounered, but I have no horse,
 87 and little knowledge in the proper handling of them."
 88  
 89 "We have some extras, and the best way to learn is to do. You are good
 90 with that bow?"
 91  
 92 "I have some skill in it."
 93  
 94 "good, we may have need of it before this trip is done."

106 find out if you can be trusted." said the Admiral.
107    "Actually, I planned on going home and changing into someniver looking
108 clothing and heading for a bar."
109    "Are you mad!" shouted Lt. Commander Lionel from the end of the table. 
110 Lionel was a short man with balding hair and the redness rising in his face
111 highlighted his hairline.
112    "Actually I'm quite bored."
113    "Now listen young man," started the Admiral.
114    "Walter, I think perhaps we should hear him out. said Commodore Kiefer.
115    "And why should we do that?" replied the Admiral.
116    "Because this man is Casey Vila, Supervisor for America's O.R.C., the 
117 Oceanographic Research Center, and son of Senator James Vila."
118    "Shit!" muttered Lionel.
119    "Alright Mr. Vila, I do believe you have the floor." Bass said with Ice cold
120 tones and glare.
121    "Well, considering the log book from the submarine Nikko lost over a month
122 ago and the diary of the Captain Jettisoned in that container suggest to me 
123 that the submarine was lost under less than normal circumstances. And,
124 considering my placement in this operation, I suppose you'll contact my
125 superiors and demand that I be 'loaned' to you to find the submarine. Am I 
126 close gentlemen?" said Vila with a half smirk on his face.
127    "It's a start, Mr. Vila. For now let's just found out what else you know and
128 why."

142 Hello everyone! AD, I'm glad you liked the poem. How do you know I'm so
143 ahead on messages/calls? Is there a way to see those statistics on the
144 Dragon? Your story is shaping up very nicely. Talos, your story is coming
145 along very well also. I'm sorry I have to break the tradition but I can't
146 do any of my story right now, I have too much homework. It's pretty dumb

185   "AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH!"  She moaned, reaching over to hit the
186 magic button that killed the alarm.  "...most stupid machine..."she
187 bumped the clock onto the floor and pulled the blankets back up around
188 her neck.
189   "BAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGH!??!!!" screamed the clock. and Cara replied
190 with a startled scream az she flopped over onto her stomach in effort
191 to hit the snoze alarm again.  This time she picked up the cursed
192 box and set it on her bed--well within reach.
193   8 minutes later, she dragged herself from her doze, and shut the alarm
194 off all together, along with the blanket.  Since it was the only heat 
195 source in the room, she'd have to go stand in front of the living room
196 heater to keep warm.
197   "One of these days" she muttered as she pulled on a rumpled robe,
198 "one of these days I'll throw that damned clock away forever."  She
199 gently picked her way thru the variety of garboge strewn liberally across
200 the bedroom floor, and poked her head ot the door.

205 Well, Things just keep getting better around here. Good to see you muse.
206  
207 Vision, There is a function that allows you to see those statistics on The 
208 Dragon, But I think it is basicly only accesable to people who have made 
209 donations. I seem to be moving slowly down. I was 53 the last time I looked.
210  
211 I agree, there is no such thing as a bad first story. I've been writting on
212 and off (Mostly off.) For about 9 years now. And still about 2/3's of
213 what I produce is garbage. It's the other third that keeps me going.

290    Most of what I write is impromptu - that is, very short, and very 
291 short-lived.  The EnvironSuit, and The Man, were both short ideas that
292 I had but could not put into drawing, nor on paper, so I wrote them down
293 for me to share with others.  Methinks some story lurks inside my
294 little nogin, waiting to explode forth like pus.  Yech, that was
295 graphic - let's try again...
296  
297    * * *

301  
302    "um."
303  
304    I turned over.
305  
306    beep.....beep.....beep.....beep.....beep * WHAP *
307  
308    "uh...um."  I turned back to where I was.  An eyelid opened to
309 behold my clock's little LED's blareing at me like the eyes of
310 some creature from the dark.  "oh." I thought for a moment that it might
311 be upset for hitting it twice.  "Oh."  I finally woke up from my
312 half-dream.  It was cold - probably 40 degrees in the room - and the
313 warm, soft, heavy blankets clung to me, begging me to stay, to never
314 leave that spot of comfort.  But I had the unfortuneate knowledge
315 of being born with a functional mind, which reminded myself that
316 I had to get up, reguardless.  I kicked a leg off of the side,
317 sh*t, it was cold! - and sat up in bed. YAHhh...it was COLD.
318 Making a quick bolt for the robe, I donned it in record time, waiting
319 for the heat of my own body to turn the garnment into a mobile place
320 of comfort.  Stepping into the house proper, my robe finally stopped
321 giving me the cold goose, and warmed up.
322  
323    Breakfast.  No - bathroom.  Which first?  "Give before you take,"
324 so the bathroom it was...and relief.  Funny, how the bathroom never
325 seems as cold as the rest of the house.  Even when you're sitting,
326 and you basically have nothing on (because you just got up), you're still
327 not as cold as you were that first moment you sat up in bed.
328  
329    Six minutes and a bowel movement later, I made a bee's-line for...
330 the couch.  Still tired.  Wanted to sleep.  GRUMBLEGRUMBLEGRUMBLEGRUMBLE
331 GRUMBLEGRUMBLEGRUMBLEslirp.  That hurt.  My stomach was reminding me
332 that I had not eaten a thing in several hours, most of which was during
333 my sleep.  Breakfast it was, then.
334  
335    Cracking the door to the 'fridge revealed several posibilities - 
336 bagels, apples, bread, jam, peanut butter, milk, and various other
337 foodstuffs - while my mind was simultaneously thinking about the
338 juice in the freezer.  A picture formed inside my head of eggs
339 (two scrambled), a bagel with half peanut-butter, half cream cheese,
340 milk - no - juice, yes, orange juice.  Not the neatest breakfast, but
341 certainly something I could sink my teeth into GRUMBLEGRUMBLE damn,
342 I had better get a move-on!  Um, grab that bagel & do one half of it
343 with the peanut butter.  SHEWSHEWSHEWswallow that first bite hit the
344 spot.  Working my way to the freezer in the garage, I located the
345 item I sought.  Running back in with a can of very very cold
346 concentrate of squished fruit, I procured a pitcher.  Whoops, hands
347 were full, either set the bagel down or eat it.  I was hungry, so
348 I ate it.  Now, about the juice.
349  
350    It never fails.  Every time you try to open orange juice, or
351 apple juice, or grape juice, or whatever, if it doesn't have the little
352 white plastic strip around the side, you can't do squat with getting
353 the lid off of the can.  Cursing, I grabbed the butcher's knife
354 out of the rack and began to hack at it.  The semi-melted juice splushed
355 onto the counter like the blood of some foe I had just slain.
356 Maybe the paper towel industry and the squished fruit people
357 were in kahoots.  But I did get the can open!  Hurray!  Wha - 
358 the juice-block doesn't come out!  OUT, DAMN SPOT!  MOVE! I squished
359 the can and the blob emerged like an enormous slug.  A very good-tasting
360 slug, that is...
361  
362    Well, I always made juice with 2 cans, just to make it strong.

384 Hello Hagbard, it's been to long. Your story is going very well.
385  
386 I guess Friar must still be feeling ill, as we have not heard from him
387 recently. Hopefully he will be feeling better soon.
388  
389 Vision, I am indeed a 'late' person. No civilized person should be out of bed
390 before noon or in before three or so. Unfortunetly the rest of the world
391 has these really strange ideas about getting up a 7 and being in bed by
392 11.
393  
394 I'll make another attempt to enter the next part of my story somtime today.
395 If the text send fails I'll just have to type it in by hand.

531 To the story.
532  
533 Early the next morning Moric was awakened by the sounds of many men packing
534 and preparing breakfast.
535  
536     "Ah, I see you are up, I had been about to wake you." Sir Alex said
537 handing him a steaming cup that gave off an eye opening oder.
538  
539      Moric Yawned and reached out for the cup. "I suppose I will have to
540 learn to ride if I am to accompany y."
541  
542      "Yes, as we discussed last night. Of course if you can keep up with a 
543 trotting horse for 8 hours.."
544  
545      Moric laughed. "No, I'll just have to learn to ride. I only wish the
546 Elves had been more fond of horses."
547  
548      "Good, I've asked Williem to give you some brief instructions, It's
549 really quite easy." 
550  
551      The lesson was a brief one and soon Moric was riding slowly back and
552 forth outside the building.
553  
554      They rode many miles that day and as the sky began to darken they
555 came upon another building very similier to the one they had camped
556 in the night before.
557  
558      "The one we used last night was the first one on this route. King 
559 Otto had them built two summers ago. It is his opinion that they will
560 encourage people to come out and settle in the countryside and thus spread
561 his influence. There are three more before we come to the capitol, the
562 two nearest to the city do in fact have the beginings of what may
563 someday become decent rest stops. Theres nothing out this far yet though"
564 Sir Alex explained.
565  
566      That night at the urging of his companions Moric took out the lute 
567 that the Elves had given him and played an Elvish balad know in the humen
568 tounge as 'The song of the land'.
569  
570      "You are one of the greatest Bards I have ever heard!" Sir Alex said
571 after the song was done.
572  
573      "Thank you for your praise, but anybody could play beutifully with 
574 this." He said holding up the Lute.
575  
576      "I think that you are being humble."
577  
578      "Perhaps." He said smiling."
579  
580      "There is a song I am very fond of. If I were to hum a few bars would 
581 you play it?" Asked one of the soldiers.
582  
583      "I will try."

614    The two cans of water were in the pitcher.  Looking in, I could see
615 the juice/blob/slug bobbing like a bouy, bumping into the walls of the
616 container.  ---News Flash--- hey stupid, get a spoon!  Yur friend,
617 the Brain.
618  
619    I had a bright idea: get a spoon and stir it!  Turning around, I
620 openned the drawers "In Search Of: the Lost Spoon Tribe" no, that was
621 a re-run from last night.  I must still be tired.  Cold.  Cold water would
622 wake me.  The stuff splashed onto my checks from the slap of my hand.
623  
624    Bad mistake.
625  
626    AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
627  
628    * *
629  
630    It just so happens that there were no spoons, so I had to use
631 a fork.  But, whenever you use a fork, the juice blob would get stuc
632 in it, which made it ideal for harpoon practice, but not for drinking.
633 Ten minutes of beating yeilded a yellowish-juice that smelled.  I
634 quickly poured some into a cup and drank it all in three gulps.
635  
636    I also remembered that I was hungry.  I think, that, maybe, I
637 was hungry.  Was I?  Oh, screw it!  Grab some eggs andCRACK.  (sigh)
638 Grab an egg CAREFULLY and clean up the mess.  Reach for the paper
639 towels (again?  maybe I should look into investing...) no, put
640 the egg in the bowl, but, no, clean it?  Just put the egg in
641 the bowl wholeCRAckdrip and NOW clean the floor.  And the stovetop.
642 (sigh) let's try again, slowly...
643  
644    * * *
645  
646    Makeing breakfast was invented by the Marquis DeSade, master of
647 pain for pleasure.  I don't care how many nuns he flogged, I still
648 say that breakfast is a form of personal torture, the anti-climax
649 of a morning.  If you can't understand how cooking food to eat
650 can drive a person to drink, then try doing it while inhaling the
651 smell of the salty bacon, looking at the bubbling moist scrambled
652 eggs, and listening to the tempting call of the mini-bagels sitting
653 in a basket just three feet from you, calling to you, saying:
654 "...put...cream...cheese...on...me..."  "eat...me...now"  "Please...
655 hurry" etc. etc. while the back of your mind works feverishly to
656 control and direct everything else on your body to keep your instincts
657 from taking over.  Instincts yelling, yearning for one thing:
658 FOOD.  And lots of it.  Your forehead perspires, your back aches from
659 leaning, and your hands shake as the adrenalin in your little heart
660 gushes forward and out to mix'n'mingle with my type O positive.
661 Rushing, rushing, rushing.  Must move.  Must cook.  Must avoid
662 making a mess.  Must move faster.  Almost finished. OH NO
663 where is the plate?  The plate?  SQUEEKgrab one fastsshhhhhBANgting
664 not too fast (don't want to break the other plates) and close
665 * Bam * the cupboard.  (sniff)....(sniff) THE EGGS ARE BURNING!
666  
667    Quickly I scooped the eggs out, by tilting the entire pan
668 onto the plate.  The pressed bacon was then heaped on top, and
669 promptly hit the eggs.  Almost running, I turned the stove off,
670 grabbed the bagel basket, and plopped everything onto the table.
671 An unset table.  (NOOOO) my mind screamed, I would have to wait
672 just a little longer, running to and from the kitchen to fetch
673 king-size knapkins (read:more f*cking paper towels), a fork, and
674 the juice, whoops, and a cup too.
675  
676    Sitting down, I directly inhaled my food through the use of
677 my civilized shovel (read: the fork) and ten flexable appendages.
678 Thirty minutes of cooking yeilded into seven minutes of pleasure.
679  
680    But I was full.  And that means I was no longer hungry.  No-one
681 cares if the pleasure of eating was short, for the simple reason that
682 they are too full to eat anymore.  And if they tried, that short-lived
683 pleasure would surely be given to the city sewer system, courtesy
684 of your esaphigial muscles.
685  
686    Maybe I ate too much.  I was abit queezy.
687  
688    (...aren't...you...tired...?)
689  
690    The couch.
691  
692    Standing up, I felt like a water balloon.  Teetering to the couch,
693 I plopped into its soft cussions, and proped my body against its
694 inviting, cool arms.  The tension from eating too quickly disapated
695 into nothing as my eyes became heavier with relief and comfort and
696 very tired and mustn't sleep and tired and..and.......and...........
697  
698  
699      I promptly fell asleep.

776 T.R., I agree with you. Not once (well, maybe 1 time) have I gotten a
777 busy signal when trying to call into this BBS. I will probably not call
778 as much though from now on as I usually contribute nothing much when I
779 call in. AD, I don't know about doing a story. My writing skills are
780 really lame....my stories aren't science fiction/folklore/fantasy like
781 most of the stories here so I wouldn't want to bore anyone.......Just
782 got back from seeing "Dangerous Liaisons". A good film. Not good enough
783 to win best picture though (It was nominated). "Rain Man" should win
784 that. Well, again I leave you saying.......

791 Don't worry about what style they belong to Vision, What ever you are 
792 comfortable with is fine. What muse is writting (atleast so far.) is not
793 Science Fiction/Fantasy.
794  
795 One of the first stories I ever wrote was when I was in the 9th grade. It was
796 a short story that was entered into the Scholastic National writting 
797 contest. It one an hounerable mention which was more then I even dreamed of.

806 S O O N. I can't say when as I am not sure. That's good that your story
807 won the mention. I can see why. You are a very good writer of Fantasy. Oh,
808 how's your tooth anyway? Did you get a haircut yet? Hey I saw that note
809 you left me on EPISCOBOARD -- I sent you back a note too. Well, I guess I

868 Heres the next part of my story. Where is everybody else? Oh well, I

870  
871      Moric awoke the next morning to find that the sky xad turned cold and
872 grey.
873  
874      The travelers ate a quick meal and were on their way again. The land 
875 about them had been steadily flatening and near mid day they came to the
876 ridge of a hill. From the ridge they could see the begyningc of a broad
877 flat valley that continued on into the mist.
878  
879      "This is the valley of Ketch, across it lies out destination." Sir Alex
880 said with a heavy voice.
881  
882      "You seem uneasy, is somthing wrong?" Moric asked.
8(3  
884      "There are people in this area who wish me ill."
885  
886      There was a moment of silence. "I don't understand."
887  
888      "Good men occasionally see things differently." Was all Sir Alex said 
889 before motioning the party forwabt.
890  
891      The land now was unlike anything that Moric had seen before. It made him 
892 feel uncomfortable to be so out in the open.
893  
894      The mist did not clear that day and when they came upon the next 
895 lodge house there was thu feeling of rain in the air.
896  
897      The good spirets of the night before had dissapated and the soldiars
898 went about their business in near silence.
899  
900      Moric set up his bed roll and pulled out one of the Elven cakes he
901 hat brought with him.
902  
903      Sir Alex walked in through the front door and strod towards him.
904  
905      "I must tell you that I was not altogether hounest to you when I asked
906 you to join out group."
907  
908      "Optomism can cled ones judgment." Moric replied.
909  
910      "A lesson I should have learned long ago." The Knight replied tiredly.

926  
927    Hello everyone.  I'm afraid that's the end of the story.  But as to
928 how I achieve the realistic effects, well, that's one of the world's
929 worst-kept secrets>
93   
931    In short, the above story was pieced together from my memories,
932 spanning a meger 7 years or so of cooking, and a pitiful 20 years
933 of my life.  Events, sensations, and feelings that were unusuall or
934 quite strong stayed in the0back of my mind.  Writing the story only
935 brought forth my own experiences with getting up in the morning, and
936 my more recent memories got to me before anything else.
937  
938    But I have something to discuss briefly with you - is life itself
9#9 a story?  A story that we interactively write from day to day,
940 weaving though infinite plots and sub-plots and plots within sub-plots
941 and (etc. etc. etc.), or...
942  
943    ...is it just an existence?  There is no correct view of the
)44 wrld because people see the world through their own viewpoints.  Even
945 the statement I just made is incorrect... and so on.  You could go
946 on for years contradicting your own logic.  But I try a more simplistic
947 approach.
948  
949    We0are all sentinent beings (for the most part).  To survive, we
950 prey upon other life forms (ie. eat plants, meat).  In some cases,
951 we even prey upon each other.  I don't believe in attacking my own
952 speicies to further my own life.  We all havu problems, hopes, dreams,
953 desires, feelings, dark pasts, and other numerous goodies that
954 dwell within our little nogin.
955  
956    I guess what I'm trying to say is that we live upon a big dirtball
957 that moves quickly around a nuclear fub~ace0that provides the basis
958 of our lives.  And, while we can create elaborate abstractions, we still
959 kneel to the underlying insticts within most of us.  Things SEEM hard
960 to those who do not wish to think things through.  Things SEEM easy
961 to those who do.
962     ---aw, rubish.  My mind is wandering again.  I'm extremely
963 tired (18 hour stint) and my brain contains the focus of a burnt
964 matchbook.
965  
966    Anyway, if you wish to improve your writing "just a little bit",
)67 (or in this case, as it applies to me alone), I simply
968 * draw upon past experiences
969 * avoid redundant word usage to keep the storyline fresh
970 * "borrow" writing styles to convey ideas that you yourself might have a
971   hard time with
)72  - - - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY - - -
973 * don't be afraid to write, and don't be afraid to write what's on your
974   mind.  Sometimes offending people is what you need to do in order
975   to make the story good.  I'm not advocating profanity, I'm si}pli
976   saying: "Go for the Gusto!"
977  
978  
979    Sometimes I feel like an old fart.  I'm a meger 20 years old, but
980 my mind wanders too and from obscene ideas and places without
981 understanding time (whew - a mouthfull!).  In short, I dqydruam
982 my stories, or conjure up a mood before or during my writing.
983 I hope that when you read one of my humble stories that I can convey
984 my own feelings and thoughts to you.  And, if I have, then I will
985 have accomplished something in0my |ife.  Part of life is
986 laughter, and when I can make people feel something without taking
987 from them, then I feel good about what I have done.
988  
989    Yag!  Enough junk already!  I meant to fill in the disk, but this
990 philisophical trash is too much!  Where am I coming up with this
991 stuff?  And where are my manners?  Right here.  Say, who are you?
992 I'm your manners.  No you're not, you're simply my imagination
993 working for me to produce answers.  Oh really?  Yes.  Well then,
994 why do you lack manners now?  Um, um, maybe YOU are my manners.
995 Serves you right then.
