20 IT SEAMS TO ME THAT BEFORE THIS DISK WAS ERRASED THAT MOST PEOPLE WERE 
21 TALKING ABOUT RELIGON.  WELL, NOT ONLY WAS JESUS NOT FAMOUS DURRING HIS 
22 LIFE, BUT IT ALSO WAS MORE THAN LIKE NOT HIS FOLLOWERS THAT TOLD OF HIM.

25    ...with a sigh the ancient alchemist leaned back against the forward
26 bulkhead of the deck house and soaked up the sun and spray off the bow.
27 It was a wonderful day and they were well on their way to find the place
28 that the apprentice seem drawn toward. In fact he had been is a state of
29 great excitement ever since they got underway. The piper on the other 
30 hand had been sleeping peacefully in little cat naps. He would open one
31 eye occasionally and look around, ever on the alert to whatever
32 opportunity might arise.
33   
34 Now Fast Fred wasn't letting any grass grow under his feet, to use one
35 of the local expressions. From the way he is directing the pace of the
36 voyage, it would appear that he is assuming the role of de facto Skipper.
37 In any case he went below to his cabin just after we got the anchor set.
38 Not five minutes later he yelled out, "Let's get it on!", so we hauled
39 the anchor up again and got underway. The craft has developed a strange
40 sort of motion. What do you suppose? But I digress...we're well up
41 river now and moving right along. 
42   
43 I wonder if the apprentice still senses our destination and how much
44 further it might be?
45 
46 Suddenly there in the sky headed right toward the craft was the largest
47 silver bird that the alchemist had seen in any space-time. And the noise
48 that it made was loud and unearthly. He started sputtering and trying
49 to yell out warnings when one of the locals tugged on his tunic and said,
50 "don't show your ignorance man, we're right in the glide path; they fly
51  through here all the time." After much whispering the alchemist finally
52 understood just what the thing was.
53 "Oh, I see an artificial levitation device.", he said. Nothing related 
54 to the artificial insemination that seemed so popular in this era.
55 Again on the other hand....but that's another story!
56  
57 "Holy Magnum Opus", he suddenly called out, "Look over there on the
58 starboard bow! What is that THING?"...

63 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
64   Hearing the alchemists call, the piper stirred in his sleep.  "That's not
65 bow, behind us is the stern -- or is it amidships?  Anyway, were on an inland
66 stream, so the terms could be all different, anyway."
67   He rolled over to look at the awe-struck alchemist pointing, then at the
68 source of his amazement.
69   "Oh my god!..... I sure hope he's friendly!"

71 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
72 IT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE HOW OR WHEN JESUS BECAME SO POPULAR. HIS SPE-
73 CIFIC MESSAGE WAS TO THE JEWISH NATION EXCLUSIVELY. THEY ARE IN FACT THE
74 ONLY ONES HE PREACHED TO, TRYING TO GET THEM TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER.
75 EVEN THE PROPHESIES SAID THOSE WERE THE ONLY ONES HE WOULD PERSONALLY
76 CONTACT. THE WORLD IN GENERAL WAS LEFT UP TO HIS DISCIPLES, WHICH WAS
77 INCORPORATED IN HIS FINAL COMMAND THEM. THE AMAZING PART OF IT IS THAT
78 HE MADE SUCH A LARGE IMPRESSION AND SUCH A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE, THAT
79 HE BECAME WORLD RENOWNED JUST BECAUSE OF THE THINGS HE DID IN A 3 1/2
80 YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. HIS INFLUENCE ON HISTORY HAS BEEN GREATER THAN
81 THAT OF ANY OTHER HUMAN. EVEN OUR CALENDAR IS BASED ON THE YEAR HE IS 
82 BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN BORN. B.C. MEANS "BEFORE CHRIST", AND A.D. OR
83 ANNO DIMINI, MEANS "IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD".
84 
85 AARON: THE BIBLE DOES NOT STATE THAT EVERYTHING WAS CREATED IN 6 DAYS. 
86 DAY CAN REFER TO MANY DIFFERENT SPANS OF TIME. ONE VERSE IN THE BIBLE
87 SAYS THAT ONE DAY WITH GOD IS AS A THOUSAND YEARS, AND ANOTHER SHOWS
88 THAT IT'S ANOTHER INDEFINATE SPAN. EVEN AFTER LISTING EACH CREATIVE DAY
89 IN THE BOOK OF GENESIS, IN CHAPTER 2, VERSE 4, IT LUMPS ALL THE DAYS TO-
90 GETHER AS ONE. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THESE ARE NOT YOUR RUN OF THE MILL
91 24 HOUR SPANS. JUST LIKE WE SAY, "IN MY FATHERS DAY," ETC. ACTUALLY
92 EACH "DAY" OR PERIOD OF TIME WAS THOUSANDS OF YEARS LONG. WHICH CAN
93 BE SEEN FROM THE CAMBRIAN LAYERS. ALSO, AS TO YOUR REFERENCE TO THE
94 TRINITY, IT IS INDEED A MYSTERY. AND ALSO A MAN-MADE IDEA THAT CAME 
95 INTO RELIGION WHEN CANSTANTINE DECIDED TO MERGE CHURCH AND STATE IN
96 AROUND 327 A.D. THE PAGAN RULERS, WHICH WORSHIPED MANY TRINITIES,
97 MADE A PACT WITH THE SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN LEADERS AT THAT TIME. THE
98 RESULT WAS AN ADULTERATION OF THE TWO, AND IT WAS DOWN HILL FROM 
99 THERE ON FOR THE MAJOR FACTION OF CHRISTENDOM. IN OTHER WORDS, THE
100 BIBLE DOES NOT TEACH A TRINITY, MEN DO.
101 AS TO THE QUESTION OF THE "CLOUD", I WILL HAVE TO ADRRESS THIS LATER,
102 DUTY CALLS!
103 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
104 BY THE WAY, I WOULD'NT EVEN BELIEVE THEM ABOUT THE SHROUD OF TURIN,
105 IF THEY DID A CARBON 14 DATING OF IT. I SAW A CARBON 14 EXAM THAT
106 HAD BEEN DONE ON A PLASTIC COMB THAT CLAIMED IT WAS MILLIONS OF 
107 YEARS OLD! PERHAPS THE MATERIALS IT WAS MADE OF WERE, BUT THE COMB
108 CERTAINLY WASN'T, IT WAS RUBBERMIAD! SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH ARE
109 A PART OF MY BODY AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY, COULD BE THAT OLD, BUT
110 I HAVEN'T BEEN ME THAT LONG. SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE IT THO..........

113 Deborah:
114 
115 Jesus only preached for the Jews while the disciples preached 
116 for everyone else? Hmmmm.
117 
118 Let me see if I understand. Jesus, who is god, preached to 
119 the Jews who ignored him, since we still have Jews. The 
120 disciples, who are mere men, preached to everyone else, who
121 accepted the message and converted.
122 
123 Why would people ignor god and listen to men who were saying 
124 the same thing? Particularly if the god were going around 
125 performing miricles. I don't understand how that works. Maybe 
126 you can explain.

129 ########################################IT WORKS BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE
130 OUT THERE THAT REFUSE TO USE THEIR OWN ABILITIES AND DEPEND ON THE EXISTANCE
131 OF A "GOD" TO RELIEVE THEM OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT A THINKING PERSON
132 TAKES UPON HIM/HERSELF. AS LONG AS WE HAVE FOLKS LIKE THAT AROUND THERE
133 WILL BE RELIGIONS OF VARIOUS SORTS FOR THE IGNORANT TO LEAN ON. AS I HAVE
134 SAUD MANY TIMES BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO BASE YOUR LIFE ON A BUNCH OF MYTHS
135 AND FABLES THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS BUT DON'T TRY TO CRAM IT DOWN OTHERS!!!
136 BIBLE THUMPING IS JUST A EXCUSE FOR TRYING TO GET OTHERS INVOLVED SO THAT
137 THOSE THAT DO IT FEEL NOT SO LONELY IN THEIR BELIEFS. NOT UNLIKE DRUG PUSHIN
138 G, THE WAY THE USERS GET OTHERS TO USE SO THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT THEIR HABIT.
139 YES, WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO IT, RELIGION IS JUST ANOTHER ADICTION THAT
140 SHOULD BE TREATED!

146        Ahhh ....... The all to familiar " Religious-Philosophical " stalemate
147 Perhaps we could streamline the discussion by developing a group of prefixes
148 that we could include in our texts. Rating our convictions on a scale of 1-10
149 thereby impling all the associated opinions, chapters & verse etc. ad nausum.
150  An example :         Rel.Cat.10  - Religious, Catholic, Devout
151 This would allow those of us who feel obligated to state their beliefs to 
152 do so in a brief but concise manner. Relieving us the tedium of repetition.
153 And allow the discussion to move on to topics where a more eclectic atmosphere
154 will prevail.

229 AND STARTED SAYING AND DOING THE SAME THINGS JESUS DID. WOULD YOU LISTEN?
230 I DON'T THINK I WOULD. LET'S SAY THIS MAN STOOD ON THE SREET CORNER AND
231 IN FRONT OF THE CHURCHES AND CLAIMED THAT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF RELIGION
232 AND GOVERNMENT (athiests and agnostics included, there were many then as
233 now) WAS GOING DOWN THE TUBES. IN FACT, THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE REPLACED
234 BY ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT, AND ONE RELIGION, AND HE WAS GOING TO BE KING.
235 THEN HE PROCEDED TO DO SOME AMAZING THINGS FOR THREE OR SO YEARS. WELL?

283 Every thing was fine, just fine.  FINEFinefinefinefine. The strange food that Graymalkin had given him was long
284 gone, and he was feeling Very Relaxed. As he was almost asleep, he began hearing voices, shouting something. Sitting
285 up to see better, he saw a large nacreous green shape looming out of the water on the starboard side, looking for 
286 all the world like a gigantic Bolo.
287 "Gimme that!" Yelled the Poet, as he yanked a bottle of beer from the fingers of one of his less-conscious 
288 companions. He raised it too his lips, only to find it intercepted by graymalkin, Who proved the depth of his
289 friendship by immediately drinking it. 
290 "Thanks."
291 "Think nothing of it."
292 "I won't."

300 a use for a computer of such stature. I have been using a discarded apple II
301 as a kitty litter box for some time now, but I must admit the roll-over
302 device takes the cake. Regarding the history of Portland computing, not much
303 chance of a change. The club has been going since sometime in '78 at the
304 current days and times, so a change is not likely. Maybe I can make arrangements
305 sometime soon. I'll talk to you more about this matter at a later time. What about this chess? Are you afraid to take
306 on the champ of harold street? huh? huh? By the way, I think this can of

325 I have noticed most of the commentators on this BBS use a term incorrectly and, I am sure unintentionally, misleadingly:
326 the word 'myth'.  Myth refers to a system of belief.  It doesn't make any judgement on the truth or validity of the
327 system of belief or individual facets of the system.  In other words, it is proper to refer to the Christian myth
328 as well as an Atheistic myth.  I immagine that most of you are using the word
329 myth in a perjorative sense.  Don't corrupt a very useful and meaningful word
330 by missusing it.  The English language contains many useful words and expressions that will serve much better.
331 Is nothing sacred!?!

342      A tease sprinkle from the mischievious clouds of spring glistened on
343 her hair as she dashed into the Inn, laughing at the vagrancies of weather,
344 out of breath from carefree dancing.  Approaching the counter where the
345 Innkeeper stood with woeful eyes cast at the doorway, she swung a bulging
346 cloth sachet and upended it before him.  Strawberries, plump and brilliant,
347 tumbled out in gorgeous abundance, and she laughed in delight at his look
348 of surprise.  
After tarrying long, exchanging pleasantries with the
349 Innkeeper, she addressed her steps expectantly to a certain front table
350 upon which lay a sheaf of freshly-inked parchment.  There, at the very 
351 top was--"Pam?!" she exclaimed, whirling around to quiz the Innkeeper
352 beseechingly, who shrugged his shoulders in bewilderment and pulled a
353 long face.  So the girl gathered up the papers and wandered outside, rapt
354 in her reading, unconciously brushing her dew-kissed curls away from her
355 eyes and plucking her rustling skirst aside from the greenery that sought
356 to anoint them with droplets, glittering in the frail sunlight.
357      
The sunlight had begun to wane again when she burst out indignantly
358 "Ach--'no room for intellect'?!  We'll see about that!"  Dropping into
359 silence, she continued reading, chuckling occasionally, merely nodding
360 at other times, then:  "O ho, Aaron, so you think it isn't arguable--?"
361 Later a delicate frown wrinkled her eyebrows, and she murmered something
362 about "abusive" several times...a wry smile crept in place of the frown as
363 one attempted to pigeon-hole the opinions..."Hmph, the old strategies:
364 'Crush the opposition by a show of force!'  'Belittle to make oneself
365 large in comparison'!"  On the last page, her eyebrows suddenly arched
366 like a stretching cat and she reached for her befeathered pen...but
367 the rain came pelting down with undue abrubtness, and she fled from the
368 sky that had darkled, finding shelter at the Backwater, her beloved Inn.

371   Smiling wickedly, the piper realized just how to defeat the great sea monster
372 that had overtaken them.  "Hey!! You!!"
373   The beast had moved quite near the craft and was looking in at about the
374 piper's head level.
375   "Uuaarooorgaaa,  whooo, meee?"
376   The great beast looked rather nonplussed for a moment.
377   "Whaaat dooo youuu waaaant diiinneeeer?"
378   "Two things, really.  First, could you shorten your vowels a little?  Second,
379 what are your religious convictions?  Is there a God?  If not who created us?"
380   As the piper spoke, a look of interest entered the beasts eyes.  "Aaw come
381 on now.  If I bite on that one, you're going to pull the old line about who
382 created the creator aren't you?  Whaddaya think I was born yesterday?"
383    The piper smiled.  It was working.  Now if he could just keep this great 
384 beast interested... He called to his companions, "Didn't6y we bring a few 
385 barrels of that brew?  Bring a couple up for my buddy here.  We're getting
386 involved in a religious arguement.  But for God's (actual or hypothetical)
387 sake, don't get this guy mad!"
388 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
389 `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `' `'
390 "Brilliant, absolutely brilliant, piper. Dazzle it with your logic and see
391 if it can be netted in a tightly woven paradox. This same discussion has
392 been known to tie up some incredible intellect into babbling trivia. One
393 thing though, assuming it is masculine may be an unwarranted assumption.
394 Another item that may be of interest to you; I discovered a description
395 of a similar beast, if not the same one, in an ancient book of myths."
396 
397 The alchemist felt that myth was in much the same category as style. It
398 was sometimes difficult to define but as he was sometimes heard to say,
399   "Maybe I can't define it but I know it when I see IT."
400  
401 "L'homme, the trouble with that stuff is that it is all too frequently
402 attempted by amateurs. The danger is that it might work."
403  
404 "It appears that the apprentice may have been leading us on a wild
405 monster chase that may get our goose cooked, if we aren't careful. 
406 If the piper can keep that rascal calm and the Ninja doesn't irritate
407 it with that pop gun again there may be some hope. I'll try to get
408 the multi-phase transmuter working again. That coupled in phase with
409 the playing of the pipes and maybe a chant or two from the Mad Actor
410 might just transport all of us out of danger and back to the INN."

413 CYM:  Alright, lets get some things straight.  So you are an athiest, so what?
414 Is this supposed to impress me any more than my being a christian bothers you?
415 I would like to believe that the religious freedom we are supposed to be
416 gaurrenteed in this country can be extended to debates here without the need
417 to resort to name-calling. I was DEEPLY offended by your earlier remarks. Is
418 it really nessesary to condemn others just because they don't play the
419 game to your rules?  I
420 would like you to go back to your earlier message,  and think of how a message
421 to the reverse would make you feel.  Just because we are of different beliefs
422 dosent make either of us non-humans. Try to give your next message a little
423 thought before you attack anyone about anything.

427 BO: Sorry if your skin is so thin, but as the saying goes if the shoe fits wear it!
428 It is not my intention to offend anyone but if your stance on the subject at hand ids
429 such that you are offended then it is not my doing but your own.I firmly believe that if we
430 "athiests" were to stand on street corners and knock on doors in various neighborhoods 
431 expousing our beliefs and trying to convert you all
432 to them then you would have a right to complain about us. I don't, however, see that happening.
433 Nor do we squander the wealth of the people on huge 'tenples' and boondoggles in the guise
434 of helping our fellow man. When I do something for someone I do it in my own name and not in the
435 name of some non-existent psuedo being that others use as an excuse for their misdeeds.

464      The  man  in  the dark cloak enters the  Inn  unnoticed  and 
465 quietly  moves to the back of the Inn.  Sitting alone at a  small 
466 table  in the rear.   Slowly sipping the drink that the Innkeeper 
467 brought him,  he sadly thinks back on what had elapsed.   If only 
468 his  poor  ability  to  express himself had been  even  a  trifle 
469 better,  perhaps?  Who is to say?  Yet she has been gone for such 
470 a long time,  how can he not feel that he has somehow caused  her 
471 to leave or to not desire his company anymore?  The most precious 
472 of  all  things  a  very dear friendship,  and  through  his  own 
473 ignorance he has thrown it away.   With an angry sweep of his arm 
474 he knocks the glasses from the table crashing them to the  floor.  
475 Then  collapsing in a heap upon the now cleared table he  quietly 
476 sobs to himself "Oh Emer... What have I done?"

494 immediately stopped listening. He knew of this one's type-- the serpent/creature was one of the long-winded

568 I am jarred from a deep sleep, or something which resembles sleep, by
569 an annoying buzzing in my head.   Shaking my head, and pulling myself
570 to my feet, my vision clears, and I am in a strange place.  Where??
571 I see a sign.  "THE INN".  Perchance there is someone there who may be
572 able to explain what has happened.    I stagger into the place, and
573 find it inhabited by many whom I seem to know from somewhere else....

575 This is XENON:
576 I have a rather athiest view of GOD... My belief is that religeon was 
577 created to control those who cannot control themselves, to give will
578 to those who have none, and to guide man through time as a group, not
579 a wild animal.  Religeon was created by some geniuuses who organized
580 z|2mankind...
581 And becuase of the need of man to follow a group, religeon formed,
582 and those who had no will became part of the group, and those who had
583 will were hunted down by the group and muredered as wiches, and devils

601 At The Inn, Milchar ponders his predicament.  'I think I will go in a spiral
602 pattern, flying about, until I sight a landmark I know.'
603 
604 Suddenly, he hears a psychic voice talk about religion and a man's size.  
605 
606 'I think that will be a priority.' he muses to himself.  He begins to trace
607 mystic runes in the air again, and the silver fire is at it's highest when
608 he says,
609 
610          "Rotation Alters the Mind"
