74 
75         That was nearly 2 months ago. In those two months, things happened
76 that no civilized human should be forced to witness. Men and women revert
77 to the simplest kill or be killed instincts when confronted with such a
78 situation. The crew as an entity broke apart as groups tore the ship asunder
79 in an attempt to get the equipment they felt they needed to make it on Dry
80 Gulch. They didn't realize that no human could make it on Dry Gulch except
81 within Sahara. Instead, Sahara was gutted like slaughtered livestock, her
82 entrails being the one last hope these crazed groups had for life. It was
83 hopeless of course, but mass lunacy has a way of clouding the mind's eye,
84 making everything murky and dark and foreboding. Suicide and murder seemed
85 the only real way off Dry Gulch, and many a former crew mate and friend
86 turned enemy and executioner in the horrible days of the peek of Madness.
87 Only a few survived in the ship after that, and they too soon followed their
88 mates in death; all but one. Sahara could not provide like she once had.
89 She was only a shell, a broken shadow of past triumph in the stars.
90 
91         The one left is me, Captain Racal. I have lived alone here in what
92 is left of Sahara, making a life out of what remains. It's not really a
93 life, but a prolonged death; it is all I have. I know my time will come
94 soon, and perhaps I will welcome it. It will release me from this death,
95 this Hell on Dry Gulch. Justice does not exist in space, for the final
96 journey of Sahara and her crew has ended here, and now...

148           The shackle releases its painful grasp and becomes my life chain
149 instead of drawing me downward. The sense of freedom dizzies my mind as I take
150 flight to new realities. The evanescent shade of sight has been lost with the
151 surreality of failure. My boundries lie unseen, as does the world. The cost of
152 my strength, rising from the crumpled form, has again been the function and
153 inhibitations of my eyes.

347   The chill grey light of dawn was just thrusting icy fingers throught the
348 forest when the piper came awake.  No sunrise, just the lightening of the
349 false dawn, cut the stygnian darkeness, washing out the stars far above,
350 leaving only the most brilliant as pale and washed-out reminders of the
351 stellar glory that had graced the night.  Dew formed a liberal coating on
352 the surrounding vegitation where last night's mosture laden air had deposited
353 its burden.  Not yet warmed and dry, the air brushed against the piper's
354 skin with cool tendrils, caressing the bruises, cuts, and abrasions his
355 last night's exertions had cost him.
356   The piper's return to conciousness  was not easy.  His emotional, added to
357 the physical pain, made retreat into darkness a most attractive option.  It
358 was just part of the piper, not necessarily a sapient person, who pushed
359 his upper torso upward on trembling, blood-streaked arms.  True, there must
360 have been at least the intellegence of an infant in the gaze that he gave
361 the nearby four-footed figure, but it was not the instant rush of "fight-
362 or-flight" adreniline that would have suffused a sapient who recognized
363 a watching wolf.  It was more with wonder, and a kind of infant's delight,
364 that the husk that had been the piper watched the watching wolf until his
365 arms trembled and dropped him prone once again.

380  for me to pass away,
381  I hope you won't fear...
382  This is my last day!
383 
384  So I wish they don't pay
385  the same kind of price I did
386  on my very last day.
387  No, not what I did.
388 
389  And now for the furniture they will bid
390  they don't know where it's been before.
391  Everyone's here, the people who didn't know me, even their kids...
392  So they take this and that, just what they realy adore.
393 
394  I would stop them if I could from taking the things I love.
395  But I can't do much of anything, except look down from above...

412 crashed. I wouldn't start looking for it to be up until Tues. or Wed.
413 CISTOP MIKEY: rumor has it that you are knowledgeable on antique electronics.
414 I have a circuit that calls for a TR1863 UART, which is very difficult to find.
415 Do you know of an alternative that would work with little or no modification?
416 For instance, I've got a TR1602.  Is it useable?
417 If you need details, lemme know.  (I will probably be at the social on Thursday,
418 late).

428 To all Commodore users:
429 I am currently trying to set up a BBS whose express purposewill be to be
430 an information line for drug treatment and drug abuse "hot-line" type of
431 actions. Anyone who has any information available and would like to share it,
432 please leave a message for Chari Anang on this BBS. Your help is appreciated.

436     Held his ground as the others faded back to the security of concealment.
437 All except Grey Shag the alph male whose position did not afford him the lux-
438 ury of security.  Yet even Grey Shag
439 held back a pace as Forrest Fang moved
440 cautiosly forward, nostrals flaired to catch every nuance of scent.
441      He could detect neither hostility nor fear.  The two legged one was now
442 standing.  With deceptive casualness Forrest Fang moved qyarter-sideways tward
443 the human till his own side rubbed against the humans side.  He could feel the
444 humans body heat through the thick fur of his side.  Still no sign of fight-or-
445 flight.  What Forrest Fang could not mis however was the empathic aura of 
446 hollow empty longing, the resignation to fate of one whose spirit, at its low-
447 est ebb, sought thirstily for any touch.      Seeing Forrest Fang unharmed, 
448 Grey Shag pushed him out to administer the test of charicter himself.
449       Without warning, though the rest of the pack knew prettymuch what was
450 comming, Grey Shag did a kind of half-jump and rested his forelegs on the 
451 human's shoulders.  Roughly he started licking the sides of the humans face.
452 This was not a cheerful greeting but a test, to see if the other would flinch.
453      Surprising to everyone except Forrest Fang, who had already experienced
454 first contact, and perhaps Grey Shag who might have guessed this two legged 
455 ones inner strength, He did not.
456      Satisfied, Grey Shag jumped down and moved back three paces leaving the
457 next part of the ritual once more to Forrest Fang who approached, tail down 
458 but not tucked, ears slightly forward and head halfway to one side.
459      He let the humans hand scratch firmly his back and shoulder before droping
460 down and rolling on his side waiting for his stomack to be nuzzled.
461      When the human complied he jumped up and half soft-bit, half licked the 
462 tip of the humans chin.  Then dancing cheerfully asside sang a howel of accep-
463 tance and greeting.
464      The others seeing this, each repeated the process in order of rank.  All
465 except Grey Shag who stood off to one side with great dignity and bearing as
466 was the way, as it had always been.

470    Red.  That was all I saw as the back of my hand came to meet with the face
471 of the man that sat across from me.  I had heard one word too many.
472    "Never speak of our commander in that tone agian!  Do I make myself
473 absolutely clear on that point?  Never!"  said I.
474    "You needn't take offence personally, Captain," said one of the men as 
475 they aided their comrade up from the floor.  The fury of the blow had been
476 strong enough to send the man realing off the back of his seat.  "All I had
477 meant was that I had found it rather strange that he should be missing for
478 so long a time.  How can one call himself a 'Guardian' if he is nowhere to be
479 found?"  The man rising from the floor pulled at his chain-mail vestiment and
480 wiped the dust from his leggings, not looking at the face of the man that had
481 struck him.
482    "But for you to suggest treason!  You cur!  Off to handle a diplomatic 
483 situation with one of the neighboring villages for our duke and you assume
484 the worst.  Gone for too long and you suspect that he has joined with the
485 enemy's house?  Be glad I struck you only once, and with the back of my hand,
486 I doubt that you may find the bite of my blade's steel edge to mend as
487 quickly as the scratches of my glove!"  My eyes were wide and my breathing
488 short.  The scent of the men's alcohol came bitterly to me and I realized
489 it was not the men that had done the talking.  "Do not provoke me thusly
490 again...  I shall go now."
491    Hearing the din of the barracks return upon my departure, the rattle of 
492 the door could only faintly be heard as it was pulled shut.  I began to
493 stroll up the hill to a place of solitude, a place where we had often shared
494 our times together, a place where we could be alone.  It wasn't really all 
495 that long ago, or so it seemed, that I had last conversed with him.
496 Although our leader, I had always considered him more of a brother for we had
497 shared so much of the same hardships in our lives.
498    Upon reaching the cove we had made near the peak of the hill I once again
499 cast sight on the 'Monument to Friendship'.  On our own, we had taken five
500 fallen trees and constructed a frame that had those words carved into them.
501 On them were two identical long swords, each bearing words on the blades.
502    On the blade that hung from the top were the words
503             'For the life of my Duke  --  the Guardian'
504    And on the blade that rested below it,
505             'For the life of my Duke...

509 				Confusion.
510 
511 The things I hear that other people say that hurt others,
512 I'm not involved, I'm just an observer, and a friend.
513 I can't help but to feel sad.
514 If there was anyting that I could say I would, I am a friend.
515 
516 There are so many times when I have had something to say.
517 I look around to see all of my peers,
518 I realy do have something that I want to say,
519 But I don't say it, not now, not here.
520 
521 There are times when all of the hiding places disappear,
522 I'm left standing all alone on the middle of the world and no one on my side.
523 What can I do, where can I run?
524 There is no one to turn to, so I turn into myself and hide.
525 
526 Please help me through the dark times.
527 If I seem to be calm and relaxed it's all a illusion.
528 When there is a smile on my face, and I'm happy
529 it's all to hide my terrible confusion.
