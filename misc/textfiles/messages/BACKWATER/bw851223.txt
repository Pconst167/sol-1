22 IT HAD BEEN EONS SINCE THE WORLD HAD BEEN AT WAR.  INDEED, THERE WERE MANY
23 HO WONDERED IF THE OLD WARS WERE HISTORICAL FACT OR MERELY MYTHOLOGICAL
24 LEGEND.  EVIL WAS AN ALIEN CONCEPT PRESENT ONLY IN THE NIGHTMARES OF
25 CHILDREN.  THE WORLD WAS FILLED WITH PEACE AND LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER; WITH
26 A SINGLE EXCEPTION.
27 THE SILENT ONE WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE ONLY SURVIVOR OF THE OLD WARS.
28 E WAS OLD BEYOND YEARS.  PRIOR TO HIS SELF-IMPOSED EXILE FROM MODERN
29 SOCIETY HE WAS A WANDERING PREACHER WHO TALKED OF BIZARRE AND ALIEN CON-
30 CEPTS.  MANY THOUGHT HIM TO BE SENILE BECAUSE OF HIS AGE AND THE EMOTIONAL
31 STATE HE WOULD ASSUME ON OCCASION.  HE OFTEN WARNED OF A GREAT POWER THAT
32 COULD ONE DAY COME AND CHANGE THE WORLD INTO A CHAOTIC DISCHORD OF MISERY
33 AND SUFFERING.  HE WAS USUALLY SCOFFED AT AND EVENTUALLY HE TIRED OF
34 TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE OF THE DANGERS THAT EXISTED OUTSIDE THEIR
35 SOCIETY.
36 
37 ON DECLARING HIS EXILE HE SAID "ONE DAY I SHALL RETURN AND MY TRUE

97 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE ORIGIN OF\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\30
98    He had a home once. He had a profession and people who loved him. He had a world. All of them are gone, now.
99 Reduced to cosmic dust and memories.
100    He was James Forster Mandell, freelance writer. His home was a small four-room apartment that he barely kept the
101 rent on but it was his. A contract to write a novel was in the offing. Life could have been worse.
102    It did get worse. Early one winter morning, he awoke in a cold sweat. A terrifying dream, almost unremembered, had
103 a firm grip on him. He had to run. Now.
104    In minutes he was dressed and in his car. He went to the nearest freeway onramp and was soon speeding north. The
105 terror faded as he distanced himself from the city. An hour later, he finally asked himself what he was doing. Sixty
106 miles was an awful long way to drive for a bad dream. That was the last time he was going to eat one of those freezer
107 pizzas before bed. He prepared to turn around at the next offramp. Just as he did so, the whole sky behind him flared
108 brilliant white.
109    He pulled the car over and got out to see the top of a mighty orange and white mushroom cloud peer over the
110 horizon. Not being stupid, he saw the significance of this immediately. Somebody had just set off a nuclear bomb.
111 James reacted to this realization as any rational, thinking being might. He fainted.
112    And while he was unconcious, the dream returned.
113    It was not at all frightening this time. It was informative. Incredibly, that explosion had been meant to kill him.
114 Only the dream (a telepathic warning, actually) had saved him. A powerful beast was loose upon the world, its sole
115 mission to kill James Mandell. All carnage caused along the way was incidental. But why was it after him?
116    A being of incredible power was slowly conquering the multiverse. World after world fell to the power of his
117 armies. The being feared only one thing: certain people had the inborn ability to tap into their inner energies and
118 use those energies on the physical plane. The power derived was intense and as versatile as the user's imagination.
119 James, unknowingly, had this power. He would have gone his entire life unaware of that fact had none of this happened.
120 Now, the dream told him, he must harness this power if he wished to survive.
121    James awoke by the side of his car. He sat up, head spinning. It wasn't just a dream. He knew it. Something inside
122 of him had changed. On a whim, he held out his hand and concentrated.
123    There was a flash of light and suddenly he was holding a sword. About thirty inches long and fashioned after a
124 samurai blade, its gleaming length became the main focus for his power. It crackled with energies barely
125 restrained.
126    But he couldn't stay to admire his handiwork. A brilliant spark traced its way north from the inferno that had been
127 his home. It was coming for him. Instinctively, he swung the blade in a wide arc. Where the blade had swung a tear in
128 the fabric of space had appeared. On the other side was a peaceful green field. He stepped through the hole and it
129 closed behind him. A second later the spot he had been standing was reduced to random atoms. He had just escaped
130 again.
131    For almost four years he had crossed between planets in this fashion, alternately pursuing and being pursued by the
132 beast. The chase finally ended in a confrontation in the magical city of Tanis. James won, just barely. Picking up
133 allies in the city, he embarked on a much greater adventure, the destruction of the beast's master.
134    The tale of this quest is recorded elsewhere.
135    Afterward, James became a wanderer, seemingly bereft of purpose. Two more years he roamed from planet to planet
136 until his travels brought him to a certain inn...

158 One Long Saturday...
159     (Part 1)
160     
161      Jim tried to comprehend this announcement. "Enslave our planet? For God's sake, why?"
162      "We do not do this for the sake of any God. We do this for racial expansion and to give our people a new purpose
163 in their lives."
164      They conquer planets because they're bored. Why couldn't he be dreaming? He needed some time to think. "Uh, what
165 will this 'report' be based on?"
166      "We are here to gain knowledge of Earth customs and evaluate its people." the little creature said importantly.
167 "Our findings will be permanently archived so that the earth culture will not be lost and forgotten totally when we
168 conquer your planet. What little we already know we have learned from your audio/video transmissions that we have
169 studied."
170      Oh, Christ, what a mess. What could he do? Call the military? Nobody would believe him. Wait a minute. They've
171 never been here before. They apparently don't know much about the planet. If their scouts dissappeared without a trace,
172 they might figure the planet was too dangerous to be bothered and leave earth alone. He had to kill the little creeps.
173 "So, I suppose you want me to teach you about earth customs?"
174      Amogo and company looked excited. "Yes! I had hoped that you might be cooperative!"
175      Jim stood up, still a little shakily. "Okay, everybody follow me." They followed him to his car, a Chevy Nova with
176 a two-tone paint job (Midnite Blue & Primer Gray). "This is my transportation." he hustled them all in the back, except
177 for Amogo, who sat in the front with Jim.
178      "Where are you taking us?" Amogo asked, curious but unconcerned.
179      "Well, you see, if you're going to take over our planet, I think you'd better explain it to our God why you are
180 doing it." Preferably in person.
181      "Oh. And you have a ritual for sending people to speak with your God?"
182      In a way of speaking. It's called murder.
183      Jim lived in a small house in the sticks. Not because he liked it, but because it was cheap. Also, the neighbors
184 were far apart and a lot of the houses were empty. The house he was heading for had been abandoned about two years ago.
185 After he pulled into the weed-choked driveway. Amogo & Co. followed him out and watched as he pulled a rather large red
186 can from the trunk. He hustled them into the rundown house, which he had purposely parked some distance away from. In
187 the mildewy front room, he instructed them to sit in a circle on the carpet.
188      "Okay," he said, "This is an important ritual once practiced by Hindus and Rajneeshees. It was recently
189 rediscovered as a very effective way to communicate with our God." He took the five gallon can and began splashing its
190 contents liberally around the room. The rich odor of gasoline filled the air.
191      "What is the purpose of the fluid?" Amogo asked curiously.
192      "Oh, it wouldn't work without it." Jim said hurredly. "Now take this." He handed Amogo a Bic lighter. "And repeat
193 this chant five times: Ohwa... Tajer... Kiyam. After the fifth time, spin the wheel on the lighter. I'll wait
194 outside."
195      "But wait, don't you wish to speak to God, too?"
196      Jim was getting more than a little nervous. "Uh, no, I spoke with Him this morning. He gets mad if I bug Him too
197 much." He began edging towards the door.
198      Amogo looked at the plastic and metal device doubtfully. "Are you certain this will work?"
199      "Oh, I guarantee results." In the doorway, Jim listened until they began chanting. Then he turned and ran for his
200 life. When he reached the car he dove over the roof. The house exploded just as he hit the ground on the other
201 side.
202      It was a good thing he had parked so far away, he thought as he stood up. The heat from the fire was awful, even
203 from here. It was doubly good that it had been raining all night, and the flames wouldn't spread much before the fire
204 department got here. He'd better split before they showed.
205      He felt bad about what he'd done to those guys. They were so trusting. They didn't seem too bright, for a people
206 who travelled the stars.
207      But then again, maybe they didn't have to be.
208      Jim almost jumped over the car again as he felt a tug on his shirttail. He spun violently to find all six aliens
209 gathered around him. They were covered with soot from head to toe and smoke rose from their bodies but they appeared
210 totally unharmed. Picking his jaw up off of his shoes, he could only stare at them.
211      Finally Amogo spoke. "It appears that your God did not want to hear what we had to say."
212      Flabbergasted, Jim still couldn't think of a reply. What the hell was he going to do now?
213

227 Franklin Pervis tried to quiet his breathing, but his breath seemed to explode out of his nostrils in huge, 
228 smokey bursts. He felt like a steam engine, idling in the darkness, just waiting for someone to hear him.
229 
230 He peered out around the corner, the small camera clutched tightly in his sweaty palm. He watched a man walk
231 calmly up a ladder, take a small canister from his coat pocket, and squirt it into the alarm bell. This Delta V 
232 was pretty good, he thought. He watched the agent smash the glass and grab the small rings. He heard the fire-
233 crackers pop and the resulting alarms ringing into the night. All the while, the small camera click-click-clicked
234 away, capturing all of Delta V's movements on 5000 ASA 35 mm film. He adjusted the infra-red lens as the painters
235 truck drove away, and stuck the camera in his pocket.
236 
237 Down a few alleys and onto a busy intersection, where he found a pay phone. It stunk like urine and most of
238 the yellow pages were torn out, but all he needed was for the damn thing to work. 
239 
240 A few rings, click, "yep."
241 "DeNiro here. 42nd Street, behind the green door. 3 PM past prime hour. I'll have the green." Franklin almost
242 felt like a real spy uttering these previously agreed-upon phrases.
243 "Yep" was the only reply, and then a click.
244 Pervis hung up the phone and huddled in his coat. The New York air had a real bite to it this time of year. 
245 He headed down a dark alley, to a place where he would spend only one night, a place he had never been before, 
246 and never would again.
247 
248 The next day the editor of "The Daily Ditto" paced nervously around his office. He couldn't believe that phone
249 
250 call. Koch sounded positively lunatic. Even more than usual. The door knocked, and Youngston nearly jumped out
251 of his shoes.
252 "What the hell is it?" he yelled.
253 A peevish face peered around the door. The messenger said simply, "It's for you sir, special delivery." Jim 
254 Youngston grabbed the packet and slammed the door in the boy's face. Tearing it open, a small note and several
255 photographs fell out.
256 
257 Jim: Surely you've heard from the mayor by now. I think Delta V is bluffing, but no use risking it. You can
258 say I've retired, or whatever, but no more articles for now. I've done all the damage I can do in the Daily Ditto
259 for now anyway.
260 
261 Don't worry Jim. I've got him covered like a blanket.
262 
263 Best regards,
264 Franklin

277 The WR.S. Razor's Edge slipped smoothly through the ether, bypassing some of
278 the nastier hazards of plane travel by remaining stable in respect to Terra.
279 Her captain turned her rudder amanually, because steering so close to a stable
280 reality without entering it was tricky business.
281 Although he was busy steering, his mind lay elsewhere.  Hours ago he had tried
282 to send a note through his recently-constructed communications center.  The 
283 unlucky paper had somehow suffered complete existence failure on the other
284 end.  Of course, minor problems were to be expected.  This was a new ship.
285 He carefully eased the ship away from a large clump of chaos.  Any more of this,
286 he decided, and I'll have to shift to Innisfal.
287 The thought of staying in the Inn during Christmas cheered him.  He wasn't
288 accustomed to being alone on Christmas.  To be frank, he wasn't used to being
289 alone while travelling, either.  Usually he had his rainbow-scarfed companion
290 with him.  Or a gnome.  The captain  wondered what had happened to the gnome.
291 A few degrees to port, then the captain threw the shift lever.  Bit by bit,
292 the swirling rainbow of disorder was replaced by a waterfront scene.  The
293 Razor's Edge was now locked in a stable reality, that of Innisfal.
294 The captain took the craft in to shore, and after arriving cut in the ethereal
295 anchors.  Mundane anchors may not always be satisfactory, but when a ship is
296 anchored to the ether itself, it is easier to break the ship.
297 A fspell-ramp slid into being at a word from the captain, and hhe walked slowly
298 toward the warm glow of the Inn in the distance.  The Edge's lights dimmed
299 as the captain walked, finally ceasing altogether.
300 A few more steps, and the captain pulls open the door.  Perhaps the Doctor is
301 here, he thinks.  Or Grann.
302 MAlmost as soon as the door is closed, Milchar hears the sleigh bells of
303 another late-night visitor of the Inn.  A few thumps on the roof and a hearty
304 'Ho, ho, ho!' later, the bells continue and fade into the night.
305 "Merry Christmas," Milchar whispers as he looks up at the ceiling and the
306 action beyond.

342 Normally, it is not the prerogative of one journalist to criticize the writing of another
343 but here, we must speak out. A veritable icon of journalistic integrity has gone astray, and has
344 launched a personal attack against a man who,
345 according to our investigation, has done little 
346 other than to protect him self-a right that all Americans enjoy, but seldom are forced to exercise.
347    This man, who has the assigned name of Delta Five, was the top agent for a pentagon based 
348 organization, and spent many years working, and risking his life to preserve the American way of life. He alone was responsible 349 justice, more than forty members of terrorist
350 organizations such as Black September and the
351 Bader Meinhoff. He personally found the cached fortunes of Reinhold Heydrich, the Nazi general
352 over Chechoslovakia in 1945."
353    This man was a dedicated defender of freedom untill his family was murdered, allegedly by a
354 "tyrant" named Leroy McKane, and then left the
355 "agency", and dedicated himself to the destruction of this McKane. 
356 This man is, in our eyes, not an enemy of the people of New York, he is rather a hero, and we
357 implore Mr. Pervis to examine his motives, and reconsider the content of future editorials"

370 been so long... The first rays of the early morning sun streamed through the window of the fourth
371 floor room at the Tucson Hilton, highlighting the red in her lovely hair. She sighed softly, and again, squeezed his hand. 
372 Carefully, so not to disturb her, he slipped out of the bed, and standing, looked down at her. A beautiful woman, in so many way373 wife...He nearly broke down at the thought, but quickly regained his self control. 
374    He plugged in the Model 100, and punched keys. The words flashed across the display-words he didn't
375 want to see, but knew that he would. Pervis. He felt sad inside, knowing that he would have to
376 break the man. It would be easy to kill him, but in spite of what Pervis believed, Delta Five did not
377 enjoy killing people. But he had to be dealt with.
378 
379 He had thought Pervis to be bright. Shrewd. But why didn't he consult one of his staff photographers?
380    Some clerk in a camera store really snowed him. 5000 ASA film? "Infra red lens"? He glanced at the Nikon FE-2 on the dresser.381 room, and faced himself in the mirror. "Always ready, huh?, he thought to himself.
382    He sat down on the bed, beside the slender form of the sleeping woman, leaned over, and kissed her
383 tenderly. He wished there could be an end to the killing, the violence, the terrorism. He reflected
384 on the words sung the previous night, at the Tucson Community Center auditorium; Beethoven, "When all
385 men shall be as brothers", and wished it were true.
386 
387 He wished McKane felt that way. But now McKane would die a very long and very painful death.
388 And then what would he do. His anger vented, he
389 would have nothing more to hate. He would go back to the 'agency', and the needles, and the liars...
390    Again, the words flashed across the screen.
391 "Parity activated". Where Pervis was an annoyance, Parity was a threat. Delta Five made another phone call...
392 It was Christmas day, and he allowed himself the luxury; he jotted down the things he needed, and
393 slipped back into bed, and into the warm embrace
394 of Linda. A last glance at the list. One pint each H2SO4, HNO3, package of cotton balls, two large
395 stainless steel mixing bowls, soldering iron,
396 wire, hand tools... Delta Five was ready.

422  The black plane shook at the return of its master. The quest to retrieve the
423 subject had failed. Before he could reach the ship that contained the subject,
424 it had warped out of space, departing to a location too distant to make
425 retrieval unfeasable. No matter. The universe teemed with humanoid lifeforms.
426 Finding another suitable subject would not be difficult.
427   The titan stood motionless in the center of the plane, stealing inertial
428 energy from the universe itself. The color of the plane changed from black to
429 dull red, to orange, to brilliant blue white. The titan was standing in a sea
430 of thermonuclear fire.
431   And then the plane dissappeared.
432   Momentarily clearing away the life-supporting mists, the titan studied the
433 constellations about him. The plane had been returned to its rightful place.
434 All that remained was to find a subject. Twin four-dimensional antennas
435 extended from the backpack. Four planets within thirty parsecs were scanned.
436 All contained humanoid life of acceptable potential. Almost thirty hours of
437 scanning finally produced a suitable subject. Like the last, this one was
438 female. Unlike the last, this one was synchronized with the time-flow of the
439 plane itself, and would age normally, rather that in reverse. Whatever had
440 posessed him to take a subject from a retrograde timeline, anyway? Also, this
441 subject had absolutely no extranormal abilities. Perhaps this would insure a
442 successful completion this time.
443   A miniature star appeared at the titan's feet. It vanished, leaving behind a
444 small, unconcious form. Computerized sensors played over the form. All life
445 functions normal. The life-support mists would insure continued functioning,
446 eliminating the need for nutritional intake or waste products. When the subject
447 recovered from the shock of transition, the experiment would begin anew.
448   The carrier numbus billowed about the titan's form, and then he was gone.
449   An interminable time later, the plane echoed with a scream of horror and
450 anguish.

488 
489  time, there  was a  very fast rabbit named 
490       Speedy and a very slow turtle named Slowpoke. They lived  in 
491       a hole in a tree in the Great Woods.
492 
              Speedy and Slowpoke  were walking down  the road, Speedy 
493      stopped  from  time  to  time,  to  let  Slowpoke  catch up. 
494           Slowpoke was very slow.
495            Suddenly, or  not suddenly (Slowpoke was very  slow) they 
496         came upon a lolly pop tree, a gumdrop tree and a  peppermint 
497        tree. And they tasted the  wonderful candy, but poof a  big, 
498        nasty, evil witch appearred shrieking  "Ah Ha Ha Ha Ha  I've 
499        caught you now.  I'll have rabbit  stew and turtle  soup for 
500        dinner". Speedy  could have  run away,  because he  was very 
501       fast, but he stayed with his buddy Slowpoke. 
502            The witch grabbed  Slowpoke. He yelled "Wait a minute,  I 
503         can trade you something that is better than turtle soup  and 
504        rabbit stew, if you let us go". The witch screeched  "Rabbit 
505        stew and turtle  soup are very  tasty, but I  will listen Ha 
506        ha ah".
507           Slowpoke led the  witch to his  workshop. Slowpoke liked 
508       to invent things. His workshop was filled with all kinds  of 
509       inventions. In  the corner  was a  big blue  rocket, with  a 
510      chair and three buttons--A red button, a blue button, and  a 
511 
          green button.
512         "I see that  you ride a broom" remarked Speedy.  Slowpoke 
513           said "This is my new  rocket. I'm sure it's much  faster and 
514           more comfortable than  your broom". The  witch looked at  it 
515           and asked dryly "How does  it work ?". Slowpoke walked  over 
516          to the control panel  explaining "There's the green  button, 
517          that makes  you stop,  and the  blue button  which makes you 
518          go, but never ever touch the red button".
519            The witch cried  "Ah ha ha  ha ha now  I can have turtle 
520       soup and rabbit  stew, and I  have a shiny  new rocket". She 
521       stepped toward the rocket  cackling and saying "I  think the 
522       red  button  must  do  something  really  amazing". Slowpoke 
523      spoke fearfully "Never ever press the red button?"
524          "I am the great witch" she gasped through her evil  mouth 
525       "I am  not afraid  to push  the red  button". Slowpoke  said 
526       shakily "No, no never push  the red button!". She jumped  up 
527      into the  rocket seat  and sticking  her bony  finger toward 
528 
          the control pa~el,  pushed the red  button. The rocket  took 
529      off instantly, the cacking, scrieking, screaming witch  with 
530 
          it.
531          "Where is  she going ?" asked Speedy.  Slowpoke explained 
532       "I don't  know, I  suppose the  rocket will  run out of fuel 
533      someday. Let's go back and get some more candy."
534 
535 
536 

537              So  they walked  along slowly,  Slowpoke was  very slow, 
538          down the road, that went  over the hill to the  candy trees. 
539          As they were  strolling, the witch  flew over scrieking  "Ha 
540         ah ah  Ha ah!!!",  but she  had no  control over the rocket. 
541         She dissappeared  over the  horizon. The  last thing  Speedy 
542         and Slowpoke saw  was the glare  of the rockets  tail in the 
543         sunset.
544           "She was kind  of a nice lady" said Slowpoke,  sucking on 
545        a lollypop  he pulled  out of  his pocket.  "I think so too" 
546       replied Speedy "Very kind of her to give us some candy".
547              So  they  walked  along  eating some of the candy they 
548        picked, and  came to  the place  where the  magic trees  had 
549        been. They found  only a apple  tree,a plum tree  and a pear 
550       tree.  The  witch  had  flown  away  somewhere  on  the blue 
551       rocket. Her enchantment  had left the  trees, and they  bore 
552       only regular fruit.
553            Slowpoke  said  seeming not too disappointed. "Turtles 
554 
          like  pears  and  apples,  almost  as  much  as  candy".  "I 
555      heartily agree"  chuckled Speedy.  So they  picked the fruit 
556 
          and took it home to share with all their friends.
557        The evil witch was never seen again.
558

573      They lived with their Mother

594 	"You know I have no idea what you just did Sam. What did you just do?"

596 for taking night pictures."

602 lens?"
603 	"Nope."
604 	"And you didn't tell him that Infa-red film does not come in speeds of
605 conventional film, and especially not 5000ASA?"
606 	"Nope."

608 you need a specially filtered light source that only the infa-red film can
609 see?"
