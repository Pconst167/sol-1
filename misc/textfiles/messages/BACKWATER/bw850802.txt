39 Trainor: Forget it.  It's okay.  I7'll just slink off, since nobody here has
40 any use for my rabbity skills at the moment.  Mayhap, yes.  It just might
41 work out anyway.  I have been working on my computer devising a story 
42 plot that would fit my character.  I could get all the other characters 
43 made up, yeah. "The Quest for the Darkherb." Hmmm....weyry interesting
44 idea.  Does it sound okay to you?  I seem to have a distinct knack for 
45 writing stories that no one seems to enjoy, and therefore make enemies 
46 with my entries.  This is something I don't want to do, and I wish that 
47 the good citizens of Inisfall could forgive and possibly forget.  M
48    "Quest for the Darkherb."  Sounds good, do you like the title??  You 
49 seem to be an experienced writer, way aboe me in writing skill,.  But 
50 it seems that everyone is.

63 dan: quite true - T means Tone, normally following D, for dial, normally
64 following AT, for attention.  The point was that the terminal program in 
65 question has a setting for Tone, Pulse, or modem default.  It was set to Tone,
66 but the T in the dial command still seemed to be required.
67 Cistop: the CP/M emulator is invoked by typing "RUN program", correct?  CP/M

95     I had gotten all my screens mapped and all I had to do was color them.
96 After 3 days I had everything in multi color and the subroutines for 
97 drawing the screens were done. Now I started making the figures for the  
98 treasures. It took me awile to make them but I finely got it done. Now I 
99 had to make the main program.
100     What I had to do befor I could program it in was learn to use the
101 
102 kernal routine SAVE. I tried it but it didn'd work. I checked all my work
103 and tried it again but it still didn't work.

108 Max: Terminal program is now in final testing stage, dial & terminal portions
109 working correctly.  New punter transfer section not tested yet.  Oh, by the
110 way, the terminal is now ML (not a 5-line BASIC loop), eliminating the quite
111 fustrating garbage collection.  Portions of the code are from MEBterm, some
112 from Microterm, some of my own...and the ASCII translate works (gasp) correctly
113 this time around!

119 Yes, it was true!  Sir Ben of Fish was still alive!  Yes, it's true that he is
120 still on the trail of the evil Jeffslime!  Yes, it's true that life has no 
121 purpose!  Yes, it's true that Wyoming bakes the most pancakes every year!  Yes,
122 it's true that I don't know why I'm writing this or how to end it...
123 The valiant Sir Ben got on his trusty steed, Rustbucket II, and once again went
124 after the evil Jeffslime.  The immortal creature which had slashed the King's 
125 credit rating just last year.
126 He urged his mule onward.  "Onward" he urged.  Rustbucket II sped off at a 
127 lightning rate of 5 mph.  In no time they had caught up with the Jeffslime.  As
128 they neared it, the slime creature turned around.  It was an ugly sight to 
129 behold.  The Jeffslime had been wounded in one of their earlier battles and 
130 there was dried blood all over his computer keyboard and modem.
131 He laughed maniacally (sp?) at Sir Ben, and screamed, "Aaauugghh!!"
132 Sir Ben trembled at the sound.  It was incredible, but his knees did not
133 jellify!!

136    I turned, leaving the memory of future quests in the back of my
137 rabbity mind.  If therse people didn't want a rabbit around, that was all
138 fine and right with me.  I fished through the little bag concealed by
139 my fur and retrieved a truffle.  Popping the little rare mushroom into 
140 my mouth, I entered Inisfall, as the tasty little juices from the truffle
141 trickled down my throat.  I managed a samall and weak smile as I hopped 
142 up onto my faritvorite table and curled pup to sleep as the sun set down 
143 from the grey and black sky (Rabbits are colorblind, you know.  It should
144 be "Red and purple sky") and the little animals returned to their homes. 
145    I slept, my mind filling with thought after thought about the wonderful
146 device that was known as thee Pell-Mell.  My little whiskers twitched as 
147 I slept, for now I was dreaming of the Scarlett Lion, brandishing a knife
148 and hacking away at my brothern.  My mind raced, my heart beat faster as 
149 my nose and whiskers began to twitch uncontollably in irritation.
150    Sleep was not going to come easy for me tonight, but itt would come. 
151 Rest assured. (No pun intended.) it would....come,...* (snore)

159 An interesting question raised its ugly head on the last disk.  How does one
160 use this system at 300 baud?  My particular answer is this:  Set MEX to download
161 then start the system outputting.  Go away.  Wait for a few minutes.  Eventually
162 the output stops, write file to disk.  Hang up.  Read file on Wordstar.  The
163 benefit is that I can read as fast as I am capable (900 baud equiv.) and 
164 skip the boring parts.  If I entered a lot of messages, I might compose them 
165 on the WP, then upload them.

168 ????? The Doctor ?????
169 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
170 The Doctor quickly glanced at the monitor while searching for the travel packs
171 stored in the TARDIS, something particularly difficult if you haven't had a
172 lot of practice.  Grann was gaping helplessly at the monitor, eyeing the dozen
173 or so Republic Guards that had casually walked into the barn.  I tried to think
174 of an easy way out of the situation.
175 No ideas came, at least at first.  The Doctor was mumbling, "...toothbrush...
176 three pairs of socks...portable chess set...sonic screwdriver..." as he packed
177 the last TP.  "Now where is that spacetime ripple detector?  I never can find
178 that thing.  It always seems to jump up and hide from me."
179 Hide?  The Doctor had an idea, but forgot to yell "Eureka!".  Hide!  If those
180 guards weren't looking for the TARDIS specifically, then perhaps we could 
181 escape their notice long enough for them to conclude their business in the
182 barn, whatever it was.  Obscuration magic.  I ran down a list of such spells
183 in my mind, looking for the one most suitable for the situation.
184 Shadow magic.  That would work.  There are enough shadows in the barn.
185 "Yeltaw Rebfem, Uspovi Edaghindaltu!" I whispered, hoping that none of the
186 guards had spotted the TARDIS as I had thought of a spell to use.
187 It seemed that none had.  If they had been looking in the right direction,
188 they might have seen a blue box, about 2.5 meters tall, fade slowly into the
189 surrounding shadows.  The guards instead had taken several digging implements,
190 then left.  Emergency over.
191 I turned back to the Doctor.  "...under the console, maybe?  No?  Grann, have
192 you seen the ripple detector?  It looks rather like... well, a pocket radio.
193 What?  You've never seen a pocket radio?  Well, they look just like this
194 thing, here."  The Doctor pointed to the ripple detector that he had left
195 sitting on the console.  "I'm not sure where it is, but I'll find it, soon
196 enough.  Help me look for it."
197 Grann looked at the Doctor, then at me.  I smiled at him faintly, then gestured
198 him to pick it up.  He did, then held it out silently as the Doctor hunted
199 about the rest of the control room.
200 "Not here...or here.  Where....?  Grann, any luck y-" He stopped, and stared
201 at the small device that Grann held.
202 "You seem to have a knack for finding things, Grann.  I'd love to be able to
203 find whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.  Things just seem to jump out of my
204 way when I want them."
205 We smiled knowingly at each other, then grasped our packs as we explained to
206 the Doctor what had happened.  "We must depart, and lock the TARDIS behind us.
207 Our destination is somewhere nearby, but it will not come to us; we must go to
208 it."
209 We left the TARDIS, and carefully made our way out of the barn.  The harsh 
210 sunlight struck our eyes painfully.  The wind stirred the planted corn in a
211 nearby field; the rustling almost, but not quite, drowned out mumbling from
212 the Doctor: "...on the console?"

225   Zephyr -- Please don't miss the point.  The reason folks are irritated is
226 not due to your writing (it seems quite capable to me) but due to your making
227 major decisions for other characters.  Perhaps in another clime you worked
228 at a story where the authors allowed others to manipulate their characters
229 to a greater degree than we here do -- however, as a mutual defense, we
230 cannot relinquish the control of our characters under normal circumstances.
231   Remember, this is an open board.  No checking is done, and for most of
232 the existence of the board it was the utopia of "all allowed."

235   The piper was sitting on the floor of the machine holding his throbbing
236 head.  The major reality shifts seemed to have subsided and he had attention
237 to spare only for his internal troubles.  This was perhaps the most difficult
238 part of an adventure -- the adjustment period while the team learned to work
239 together.  With as fiercely independent a group as Trainor had gathered,
240 this learning period could be quite trying.
241   Heaving a sigh, the piper rummaged in his sporran.  There it was -- now 
242 was this medicinal or non-medicinal?  Irritated, he put the bottle back and
243 pulled out an identical container.  Smiling the piper removed the cap,
244 placed the bottle of medicinal scotch whiskey to his lips and carefully
245 counted four swallows.

302 			A DAY OFF
303 	So you want the day off. Let's take a look at what you are asking for.
304 	There are 365 days per year available for work. There are 52 weeks per
305 year in which you already have two days off per week, leaving 261 days
306 available for work. Since you spend 16 hours each day away from work, you
307 have used up 170 days, leaving only 91  days available. You spend 30
308 minutes each day on coffee break that accounts for 23 days each year,
309 leaving only 68 days available. With a one hour lunch period each day, you
310 have used up another 46 days, leaving only 22 days available for work.
311 You normally spend 2 days per year on sick leave. This leaves you only 20
312 days available for work. We are off for 5 holidays per year, so your 
313 available working time is down to 15 days. We generously give you 14 days
314 vacation per year which leaves only 1 day available for work and I'll be
315 damned if you're going to take that day off!!!

353      I was trying to find a way to
354    
355 earn money for my spaceship when my
356 buddy called me up. As we was talking,
357 I asked if he had any ideas on how
358 to earn money.( Texas style "I'm 
359 reffering to oil"). He said all he 
360 could think of for a kid of my age
361 was paper delivering. I thought about
362 it for awile and decided to give it a 
363 try. 
364      I called the Oregonian and asked
365 if they had any paper routs that I 
366 could do and they said they didn't
367 but would call me if any came up.  up.

374   Neohama -- Just a few suggestions for you.
375 1.  Most folks that use this system use 80 col displays.  Your 40 
376 entries are quite wasteful of disk space.  Better yet, (if you don't care
377 how you look to the 80 col. folks) use 120 cols for your entries and cut
378 your disk usage to 1/3 of what you are now taking up.
379 2.  Please refrain from using control characters in your messages.  Some of
380 us use them differently from the C-64.  (On my terminal, for example, it
381 can put the terminal into graphics mode -- the terminal then scrawls lines
382 around until I change it back.  Other folks have machines that do other
383 things.)  To combat this, I use the "CC n" command.  It makes some of the
384 things some folks (not necessarily you -- try it sometime) look quite silly. 
385 3.  Appeals for "awsm' C/64 users" are more likely to be productive on one 
386 of the many boards run by and for them.  
387   I'm not trying to put you down, just trying to suggest that energy spent
388 on reaching a wider audience might be very well spent.
389   good luck

392 4.  Also the use of six lines per message just for boarder is a bit excessive.
393 5.  The phrase "awsm' C/64 user" is a contradiction in terms.

409 WKWKWKWKWKWKWKWKWKWKWK
410 off the stainless steel of a brand new Ginsu Stake nife kit!  It was so 
411 wonderfull I could hardly breathe, and in just a few moments it would be
412 mine, all mine!  I just couldn't hold back the excitment, my hands are
413 shaking so badly I don't think I'll be able to control myself, I must get
414 those steak nives!   Mine, they must be mine!  Ever since the day I ordered
415 them I have been waiting for this moment when the UPS truck would pull up
416 to my door!  MY DOOR!  And here it comes, comming up the street I can see it
417 now.  Just a few more moments, I think I'll go outside - save the driver the
418 trouble of comming to the door....  ..Standing in the middle of the street
419 I can see my nives in the front window of the truck, getting closer and closer!
420 Mine!  All mine!

422  Wierd child hit by speeding UPS truck found in the middle of the street
423 Monday, August 8th.  If you are missing a child that was wearing a yellow
424 sweater with a large black jagged strip on it, please come peel him off 
425 the street, the flies are getting to bother the neighbors.

430 Yes, I'll jusp wait here... Take that back, I'll jusp sit here (middle of
431 street ya know) and wait to eat those words.  I just imagine how good they'll
432 taste when some friend sprinkles them all over my flat little body, can't wait
433 to see them soak into all this goop that used to be me!  Just call me been dip.
434 ---------------------------jusp waiting--
435 No, we shouldn't really call you "been" dip, because that would tend to imply
436 that you are no longer a dip.  How about "being" a. dip?  Sigh, and the disk
437 was going so well just 6 hours ago.  Ah well...

449 L'homme: While rummaging through my files, I ran across a file marked
450 LNW80, in it I found: 1.) manual labeled LNW-CP/M operating system.
451 2.) pages 74 - 88 of LNW owners manual. 3.) pages 36-40 of an unlabeled
452 section of an LNW manual refering to the serial port. 
453 If any of this is of interest to you, I'd be glad to let you have copies
454 of it. P.S. in the file there is a reference to a R. Brooks of RCA corp.
455 Hanover, MD  21076  who apparently knows something about
456 the LNW. I believe the information came from him.

466 Mikey:Sure I would be glad to get a copy of the LNW stuff. I probably already
467 have most of the stuff, but who knows? I wasn't able to get in touch with Hrothgar this weekend, so I wasn't
468 able to check out the PCjr stuff. I will try sometime this weekend. No new information for you on Copylink. I did try
469 the generic MSDOS version on the Tandy, and it loaded ok and didn't crash. I didn't have a modem to check out the
470 program with. I think this qualifies as no new information. I'll try some more AT tests tomorrow too. When would be a
471 convienent time to drop by US Digital this week?
472 Leonard: B protocal? What do you think I said now? Yes ProYAM does support it, as well as Compuserve's graphics protocal

521 hair falls out and all known muscle tissue goes to the waist.  They have to
522 buy special chairs to support the new form but somehow they don't seem to mind.
523 Just sit and stare while someone writes about total jibberish, they just sit

554 I will be able to get things straightened out and enter it tomorrow.

556 Why don't you be a normal little person and TYPE them in?  You don't
557 have to worry about taking up other poeople's time!  And if you are taking
558 up their time, what would they do with it if you weren't on?  They would
559 list all the disks a couple of times to make sure they have seen them.
560 And that would take more time than you would have.  And on top of all that!,
561 they don't care who's time they are taken so all that comes out of it is
562 you get ripped, Ripple.  Be agressive! Get in there and go go Go GO!
563 People will never get to read your story if you never get it up.
564 (ps. hopelfully your story isn't one of those that is 30+ lines that just
565  put the reader asleep anyway.  If it is, disregard this message, wait 'till
