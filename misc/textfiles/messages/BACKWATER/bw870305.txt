30 4.7 was the last standard version of the software that was generated.

36 REALLY?   HMM... THERE'S A PLACE IN CALIFORNIA CALLED EDGE TECHNOLOGY (NO,
37 NOT THE ONE HERE) THAT STILL MAKES THE DISKWRITER. THEY WERE   THE ONES (IF
38 MY GUESS IS RIGHT) THAT WORKED WITH  HAWTHORNE TECHNOLOGY, AND CALLED THEM-
39 SELVES "HANDS-ON  TERMINALS".
40 WELL, I GOT THE SPECS  OF THE TANDON TM100-1A DRIVE JUMPERS AND
41 SWITCHED DRIVES. NOW I HAVE A WORKING DISKWRITER THAT'S EXTREMELY QUIET!
42 ANYBODY NEED A BAD MPI DRIVE?
43 IF IT IS OK WITH HAWTHORNE TECHNOLOGY, I KNOW A FRIEND WHO WILL COPY 2708'S
44 AND YOU CAN HAVE 4.7 FOR YOURSELF.   YOU MIGHT WANT TO  REVIEW IT FIRST, THOUGH.

55 the only retirement home for people in the business is six feet under.
56         In the event that you're still alive, I'm making this contact.  I
57 have been hired for a job in your territory, and it's only good policy
58 to clear things with the area boss beforehand.  My operation will be
59 small--I usually work alone and don't like to make waves.  Publicity is
60 poison.  I had to lay low for a year after that fiasco in Tangiers.  Of

113 The choices were numerous, but none appealed to her at
114 the moment.  That was probably due to her exhausted
115 condition, she realized.  It would be best to go to one of
116 her favorites--even if she didn't currently relish the idea. 
117 She needed sleep, and time to renew her mental energies. 
118 The long wait had been boring and, therefore, draining. 
119 Shape-changers thrived on action.
120         The name Laodah came to her mind.  A week as a temple
121 cat, chasing rodents, would be just what she needed.
122         She removed her tattered clothing and used it to make a
123 cushion on the ground.  She sank into a cross-legged
124 position on the cloth, inhaled deeply, and cleared her mind
125 of extraneous thoughts.  
126         She invoked the goddess Hobeth, first of her People. 
127 Repeating the vows sacred to Hobeth, by which the shape- 
128 changers lived, she entered the trance-state of
129 transformation.
130         She focused on the river which ran below the temple set
131 high on a hill overlooking the city of Laodah, main port on
132 the smallest continent of the planet Hyunh.  She
133 concentrated on remembering the feel, attitude and sense of
134 being a cat.  Minutes passed.
135         Without awareness of her current surroundings, she
136 arose and walked straight ahead, through the willow
137 branches, her inner consciousness pulling her to water.  She
138 entered the water and kept walking steadily until it closed
139 over her head.
140         On the bank of the pond the Magus tore through the veil
141 of willow branches just in time to see the top of a white
142 head disappear under water.  He plunged in after her even
143 though he knew he was too late.  Once again she had eluded
144 him.  He dragged himself out of the pond and slogged
145 back in the direction of the Inn.  He hoped the Inn Keeper
146 had a good supply of brandy--it was going to be a long
147 night.
148         It was high noon and hot when the small white cat
149 scrambled up onto the river bank and shook her paws to
150 remove the water.  Fur would dry quickly in the heat,
151 but the cat's instinct to sit and clean herself overrode the
152 human knowledge that the sun could do this.  Soon the cat
153 was on her way again, up the hill to the temple complex.

158 Jim: first of all, I never left you a phone number! If you thought that the
159 number following the JD was a phone number, you must have annoyed a lot of
160 people. The "JD 24468##.####" is a date/time code! (see Julian Day Number
161 in a good reference work)
162 I *might* be interested in 4.7 ROMs for the Diskwriter. I'm not all that
163 interested in that other stuff you mentioned. If it is possible to borrow
164 that burner/copier I may want to make a deal with Mike regarding a few
165 things...

171 leonard, i don't think you could use that eprom burner unless you have
172 an old swtpc-6800 lying around, and i don't think andy will let it out 
173 of his sight. however, if you have an s100 machine (maybe cromemco-ish)
174  i have a bytesaver-II you may borrow (no manual yet) and an eprom
175 memory card with space for 16 2708's. the eprom burner has a capacity
176 of 8 eproms and is strictly for 2708's.
177 as far as making sure the board's pins are connected where they should be,
178 your guess is as good as mine.
179 also, bryan (who runs emerald microware in beaverton) copies/burns 2708's,
180 but for a fee. i thought his rates were fine.
181 if you will be copying them via andy crouch, great! he has a whole bag
182 full of 2708's, eprom blaster &  a good u.v. lamp with which to erase them.
183 andy may  or may not charge a fee. maybe not.
184 any of this sound interesting?

208             Rich took her earset and nearly ran into the wall as she tried to
209     angle around it. The music was a loud and fleeting inspiration. Her need
210     to show it was manifest in the adrenaline that got her up the three
211     flights of stairs to the roof she had her typewriter at.
212             It sat on a slab of stone. That slab of stone was just a part of
213     the ancient Irish castle Rich lived in. A roll of paper rustled against
214     itself in the light breeze of the roof. As Rish typed, the roll grew and
215     grew until it hung over the side of the cobble railing by thirty feet.
216     Her inspiration was gone by the time the roll had lengthened to the dirt
217     path just below the roof.
218             Tailor came out onto the roof knowing she would be there. He
219     wondered if she minded being alone and then he wondered if she would mind
220     his tapping her on the shoulder. Her earset almost fell out of place when
221     she jumped. She dialed down the music and raised her voice.
222            "What the Hell did you do that for?"
223            "Sorry. Kinda had to."
224            "Are you and the guys ready to set up or something?"
225            "Just about."
226            "Plug in down by the corner of the stair nearest the door."
227            "The main amp has quite a drain on it."
228            "Run a cord from the dining chamber."
229            "Chamber?"
230            "Chamber. It is in the layout plans for this old place."
231            "Esthetic."
232            "So?"
233            "I'm on my way."
234             Rich took her earset and put it back in place, tuning into a tape
235     of her own Irish rock band for inspiration as a songwriter. She went
236     downstairs later and put on a pair of jeans and a thin white shirt made
237     of gauze. It would be better to perform in than her prim and proper
238     nightshirt.
239                 Kids from the nearby finishing school started to file in just as
240     the sun went down. It was an Ecstatic crowd, if you're hip enough to know
241     what that means. They rocked until just about eleven, when the place
242     started dying, and private parties began.

260 2 'The Night Before Christmas, 2001'
261     from OMNI magazine, Dec 19??
262  
263  
264  
265  Twas the night before Christmas,
266  and all thru my home
267  Not a creature was stirring,
268 0 not even my clone.
269 11 
270 12 The test tubes were hung
271 13 by the burner with care,
272 14 In hopes that Saint Nicholas
273 15 soon would be there.
274 16 
275 17 The androids were nestled
276 18 all snug in their beds,
277 19 while visions of mc2
278 20 danced in their heads.
279 21 
280 22 My wife in her jumpsuit
281 23 and I in my vest,
282 24 Had just settled down
283 o some drug-induced rest.
284 
285 27 When out by the labs
286 here arose such a clatter,
287 My bed woke me up
288 30 to see what was the matter.
289 
290 32 Away to the window
291 33 I hastened my mass,
292 Tore open the blast shields
293  and threw up the glass.
294 36 
295  The refraction of moonlight
296  thru the smog-ridden air,
297  Gave a luster of midday
298 40 to everything there.
299 1 
300 2 When what to my bionic
301 43 eyes should appear,
302 4 But a mass-driven sleigh
303 5 with some strange landing gear.
304 6 
305 47 With a quick little pilot,
306 48 a company man,
307 49 Who did what was asked
308 50 and followed the plan.
309 51 
310 52 More rapid than phantoms
311 53 his coursers they came.
312 54 He impulsed his crewmen
313 55 and called them by name.
314 56 
315 57 "Now Redox! Now Hewlett!
316 58 Now Quasar and Photon!
317 59 On, Laser! On, Xerox!
318 n, Pulsar and Proton!"
319 61 
320 62 "To the top of the dome
321 63 by the air intake vent.
322 64 Now dash away quickly,
323 65 before our fuel's spent."
324 66 
325 So, up to the air vent
326 68 his coursers they flew,
327 69 With a craft full of toys
328 and Saint Nicholas, too.
329 71 
330 72 And then, in a flash,
331  on the dome I did hear,
332 74 The scratching and scraping
333  of stout landing gear.
334 76 
335  I steadied my blaster,
336 78 my chest to the ground,
337 79 And then, thru the air vent,
338 80 he came with a bound.
339 1 
340 2 He was dressed in a three-piece
341 83 he'd rented near here.
342 84 (Why purchase an outfit
343 85 you wear once a year?)
344 86 
345 87 A life support system
346 88 he wore on his back,
347 89 While the toys for the droids
348 90 he took out of his pack.
349 91 
350 92 A bottle of synthroid
351  held in his hand.
352 94 (He was quite overweight
353 95 from a poor thyroid gland.)
354 
355 97 He brought out the toys
356 98 that department stores sell;
357 99 The elves at the pole
358 could not make them as well.
359 101 
360 102 He checked with the base ship
361  while doing his work,
362 104 And filled all the test tubes,
363  then turned with a jerk.
364 6 
365 7 His anti-grav belt
366 8 was secure, I suppose,
367 109 And pressing the keys,
368 110 up the air vent he rose.
369 1 
370 12 He sprang to his craft,
371 13 to the crew gave a shout;
372 14 The ship heaved a shudder,
373 15 then blasted them out.
374 16 
375 17 But I heard him exclaim,
376 18 as he flew out of sight,
377 119 "Merry Christmas to all,
378 120 and to all a good flight."

421 The Magus paused before entering the Inn to collect his wits and
422 cast a minor cantrip to dry his clothes.  His dignity had
423 suffered enough for one night without also having to endure the
424 stares of strangers.
425      Expression composed, clothes back to their usual immaculate
426 state, he entered the sea of noise that was the public room of
427 the Inn and looked around for an empty seat.
428 He found one in a corner away from the crowd.  After pausing at
429 the bar for a snifter of brandy, he worked his way toward the
430 seat.  As he neared the table of the person who had given him
431 directions, he merely nodded.  He was still too frustrated and
432 distracted for idle conversation.
433      He slowly sipped his brandy, staring blankly at whatever was
434 in front of him.  He was beginning to question the value of this
435 whole misadventure.  Perhaps his fascination with shape-changers
436 had deluded him into thinking that it was necessary to have
437 control of one in order to achieve his goals.  He had certainly
438 wasted enough time on it--1 month in that pleasure city on
439 Phaedra, then at least 2 more in a dusty room here.  This was not
440 his idea of progress!  On the other hand, should he just give up
441 after having invested so much time?  Big decisions like this
442 required long drunken meditation, in the Magus' opinion, so he
443 dutifully applied himself to the task.

459 well, i got an interesting surprise from zilog's rep in the mail today.
460 the z800 series has been renamed. now, only the cpu with the 16 bit data bus
461 and the 24 bit address bus  & the cpu with the 8 bit data bus w/ 24 bit address
462 bus is left. the ones with  the 18  bit data bus have  been removed.
463 the name for the 8 bit data-bus chip is the "z180".
464 the name for the 16 bit data-bus chip is the "z280".
465 they must be following intel's footsteps for names.
466 the processor with  the 16-bit data bus can support up to 4 other processors,
467 like a floating-point unit (fpu), etc.
468 the new z's have a new stack pointer called the "system" stack.
469 they also have a bunch of new addressing modes (like 16-bit displacement with
470 any register pair i.e.   LD    A,(IX+0FE2Ch)      )
471 and the chip packaging changed too.
472 they only come in 68-pin plcc or lcc packages.
473 they also support the z-bus  (z-bus? i never heard of the z-bus!).
474 i just got the technical manual in my hands  and found out  that the new
475 z's haven't been FORMALLY announced, but will be very  soon (month or 2?).
476 anyone interested? maybe i should find out the cost...

478 -----------------------
479 oops! almost forgot. do any of you remember the 68020's "user" and "system"
480 modes? the new z's have  adopted those modes and one other feature of  the
481 68000 series. external processor instruction traps (that's what the system
482 stack is  for).
483 leonard, edge technology california no longer manufactures  or  supports
484 diskwriters. they referred me to C &  L TERMINALS.

488    The end was near for the star Epus VIII. Having been broken from it's course by a chance encounter with a massive
489 collapsar, it tore a rogue course though the galaxy, it's core badly unstable. For seven of the star's planets, cold,
490 blasted balls of rock and ice, impending destruction meant little. But the eighth lay well within the warm zone of
491 probablility, and indeed life teemed there. For now.
492    He stooped down, and the small furry animal ran to him unafraid. Somewhat resembling an earth squirrel, only larger,
493 it hunched back on its hind legs, nose sniffing inquisitively. This was a world that had never been ravaged by sentient
494 life. No artificial structure had ever marred its features. It was like a garden of eden, one sin had never
495 discovered.
496    With a weary sigh, Zeb stood up. He sheilded his eyes in the fierce, flickering light. It shone blindingly off the
497 snowcapped peaks in the distance. The sun sputtered through the overhead cirrus like a welding arc. Already the plants,
498 absorbing far more radiation that they were accustomed to, were beginning to wither and die. It would be months before
499 the damage became irreversable, but then the planet didn't have months. The astronomers that had informed Zeb of this
500 phenomenon estimated Epus VIII had five weeks before it would nova. Before this planet would be scoured to the core in
501 one bright, soul-rending flash. And all this beauty would be gone... forever.
502    Of all the tragedies Zeb had observed in his travels, this was close to being the worst. The destruction of a planet
503 was barely within the comprehension of the human mind. They skies, the trees, the mountains, even the very ground he
504 stood upon would be destroyed. It was almost impossible to imagine. And very, very depressing.
505    Enough. There was nothing he could do here. He did not have the power to calm a star, or to move a planet to safety.
506 He knew of none who did. Frustration did very little to help his depression. What he needed was a drink. A lot of
507 drinks. Maybe after a nice headsplitting hangover he could forget a little and go on with his life. And he knew just
508 the place to do it.
509    Shouldering his worn backpack, he picked up his ironwood staff and... vanished.
510    He reappeared in the middle of a very familiar set of crossroads. The stable, secure sun of this world had set some
511 time ago, and the sound of voices and laughter floated from the building ahead of him. He walked through the courtyard,
512 past a small rowan tree (he had to ask last time to know what it was), and pushed open the heavy oak door. Inside the
513 common room, conversation lulled slightly as the patrons took notice of him. Seeing nothing unusual about him, they
514 returned to their business. Fine by Zeb. Scanning the room, he saw none of the faces he remembered from his last visit.
515 He saw a few that had been here last time, but he had never been introduced.
516    He walked over to the bar, where the innkeeper was setting up another round of drinks for a particularly loud table
517 nearby. Raising his voice over the din, he said, "My dear sir, I would-"
518    The innkeeper put a hand to his ear and looked at him questioningly.
519    Louder, Zeb repeated, "My dear-"
520    The man put a finger up, motioning for him to wait a second. Drawing a deep breath, he turned to the loud table and
521 bellowed "PIPE DOWN!" loud enough to make plaster rain down from the ceiling. The entire room fell silent as everyone
522 turned to stare at the innkeeper. He glared at the occupants of the once noisy table and said, "Last warning. I mean
523 it. Next time you're going out the door head first."
524    After a long moment, conversation once again resumed, much more quietly this time. "Much better." the innkeeper
525 beamed. "Now, as you were say-" He looked around. "Hello?"
526    Ears ringing, Zeb pulled himself up off the floor where he had dove when the innkeeper yelled. In a somewhat shakey
527 voice, he said, "I said I would like to purchase room and board for a few days. I can pay in gold. And I would also
528 like a bottle of the most potent wine you have, and a table in a corner where I can get smashed in peace. Not to worry,
529 I am a very quiet drunk and am in no mood to make trouble anyway."
530    The arrangements were made and he took his bottle to a table by the fire that was so enshrouded in shadows he found
531 it by bumping into it. He sat down and uncorked the bottle, staring out at the patrons in the common room. Such an
532 unusual place, such unusual people. If only there was someone out there who could help him...
533    Pushing aside pipe dreams, he raised the bottle and took a deep burning drink. The first of many.

544 I picked my book up from where I had thrown it when the ***PIPE DOWN***
545 had thundered through the room.  What a strange evening, first a man
546 asks weird questions about fishing, rushes out the door, only to come 
547 back a few minutes later, having been cleaned and pressed in the mean
548 time.  Then he barely acknowledges my existence, and that after he 
549 nearly ripped my shoulder off earlier.  Then a 21st birthday party appears
550 and makes the devil's own noise, and now this.
551 Good grief.

569     China rose out of bed. She had been laying on the bed for just over two
570 hours and it was time to have met the morning. Bright yellow steams of light
571 came in through the sky light. At least the rooms here were clean. She saw
572 that no specks of dust hung in the air as she passed the shaft of yellow light.
573     China picked up the radio set and put the thing around her head. She
574 tapped out a code of sorts on the clicker. It was not quite a radio
575 transmitter but it was functionally identical. Her fingers deftly snatched up
576 a pencil when the return beeps came. It loudly scratched across her pad of
577 paper as the letters of the reply formed. Strokes of wide and sweeping length
578 crossed the page as she wrote. Symbols that once appeared about three others
579 were now to the left, and their usage had changed in her mumbling them to
580 herself.
581     She put the hearing gear on the table again and stood up. The pencil
582 started to roll off the table. It curled its path to lay counter to the slope
583 of the table. The pad, pencil, and all the radio equipment was quickly stuffed
584 into the canvas bag she had brought with her. A paperback book was hidden
585 halfway underneath the covers of the bed, fallen on the floor during the
586 night. She dropped that in the bag also. She drew the cord together and bound
587 up the haversack, radio gear and all.
588     Then she left the room, making sure to have left no traces of herself
589 inside. If only it had been as easy to make sure therer were no traces of
590 yourself left in the memories of lovers. It was just about the only time she
591 was ever sure she had not forgotten something. Instead, she was remembering.
592    "Why do they call you China?" The reporter had asked with suspiscion.
593     Her gentleman escort had answered quickly before they got into the car.
594    "China used to be named Cathay."

604 I rose, stretched, and closed my book.  Since the Innkeeper had thrown out
605 the birthday party, it had been rather quiet.
606 "Barkeep, would you like me to get another load of wood from the shed in
607 back ?"  
608 He smiled and nodded, tossing me the canvas wood tote.  I went through the
609 heavy front door, and around to the back, where the wood had been seasoning
610 for a number of years.  I heard a branch snap behind me, and then blackness
611 engulfed me.
612 I awoke some unknown length of time later, and felt the back of my head,
613 my hand coming away sticky with blood.  I heard some friends calling my
614 name, and called to them, rather weakly, "I'm over here.  How about a little
615 assistance, as I seem to have been injured."  
616 A group came over and helped me up.  I saw a note, attached to a large brick.
617 "Keep out of my way, all of you.  Next time I will show no mercy."
