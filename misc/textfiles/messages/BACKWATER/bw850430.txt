64 And now the final act; the culmination of a year and a half of performing.
65 I will not get a curtain call.  The end is the end, no encore allowed.
66 We will be "good friends" although it hurts me to even see him anymore.
67 We still share a bed--at least, until I find an apartment.  He says he will
68 help me move.  It must not be easy for him, watching me cry.  He won't let
69 me hit the wall with my hand because I will hurt myself.  He doesn't know
70 what it feels like to be left behind, and I can't make him know.  My mom,
71 in her infinite wisdom, says, "I know it hurts, but you have to look
72 beyond it."  A funny scene in the social room of the dorm:  Someone says
73 that they assume we'll be living together next year, too.  I announce our
74 official disengagement; embarrassed silence follows, and I remain amazingly
75 composed for someone who has lost everything that mattered.
76    I finally broke it...I can't fix it this time.  
77    Don't put all your eggs in one basket, mom says; but hey, if you've
78 got broken eggs, make omelettes.

81    Entropy -- please accept the loan of one large, well-padded shoulder to
82 cry on.  It's been used a lot before, has other tear stains on it, but still
83 tries to offer some comfort.  To add to what your mom said -- if it didn't
84 hurt, there'd be something wrong.  You are at a point in your life that feels
85 like forever -- mercifly we forget those times when we pull out of them.
86    Having been through the identical emotional mill, I know it doesn't help
87 much, but you WILL get over it.  Until then, a well-padded shoulder and
88 a quiet "I understand" can help a lot.

102      "Thank you for coming, Mr. Salazar, I've heard a great deal about your
103 abilities."  The elderly, white haired man rose from behind the large
104 cherry-wood desk as Salazar entered the office.  Salazar's eyes immediately
105 took in the room, noting the subdued furnishings and large collection of
106 what appeared to be legal texts lining the walls.  It was hard to be sure
107 of the size of the office as the dim lighting and dark paneled walls
108 combined to interfere with his examination of the surroundings.  The white
109 haired man gestured to a leather upholstered chair in front of the desk as
110 he returned to his own chair.
111      "I'm quite pleased to be of service, Mr. Rommel," Salazar said as he
112 sat down, listening to the faint hiss of air as it escaped from the deep
113 padding on the intricately carved wooden chair, "particularly in this case.
114 I have a special fondness for Pam.  Our friendship goes back some years,
115 and she has..."
116      "Excuse me for interrupting, Mr. Salazar, but I'm a busy man.  Unless
117 it has a direct bearing on the disposition of this case I would prefer to
118 not hear it."  Picking up a thick manilla envelope from the top of the
119 desk, Rommel tossed it lightly so that it landed in front of Salazar.  "In
120 this envelope you will find additional information, transcripts of the
121 interviews of all witnesses including one or two that I believe were
122 planted by our opponents, as well as the flight path, registration, and
123 ownership of the aircraft in which my client was later taken."
124      Salazar leafed through the mass of documents, glancing briefly at
125 each, until he came to one on which he recognized a familiar name.  "Wait a
126 minute.  This says.... McKane Industries!"  Salazar sat back in his chair,
127 surprise and concern momentarily showing on his usually stolid face.  "If
128 Leroy McKane is involved in this.... how did you get this information?"
129      "The how and why is unimportant.  Suffice it to say that I too have
130 sources within certain circles."  Rommel's hands steepled before his face
131 as he leaned back in his chair.  "As you know, the McKane organization has
132 sufficient resources to accomplish this sort of adventure with little
133 difficulty.  I will supply you with whatever you need in terms of capital,
134 and I am assigning you the use of my Lear for the interim.  I do not have
135 advanced weaponry available, but I'm sure that you can satisfy your needs
136 from your own connections."  As Rommel rose from his chair and walked
137 around his desk Salazar noticed a distinct limp and a stiffness in Rommel's
138 left knee.  "My secretary will provide you with the cash advances,
139 documentation, passports, and so forth.  Due to the urgency of this
140 situation I would recommend that you begin immediately."  The door opened,
141 and the secretary Salazar had noticed before stepped into the room.  "Anna,
142 please help Mr. Salazar in whatever areas he desires.  He is to have
143 complete cooperation.  Unless you have further questions, Mr. Salazar, I
144 believe this meeting is over."

191 other people's trademarks and then fill a bunch of lines with done/end/stop/
192 wait/done/save/stop and other really cool stuff that just, like, well, ya know,
193 shows everybody how really smart we is.  I mean, ya know, why spend a lot of
194 time trying to write something when, ya know, like nobody cares anyway.  I
195 mean, like it's so much easier to not use your brain anyway.  Because, it's
196 just all gray and wet and slimy and, well, ya know, icky looking, and you don't
197 need one to be a heavy metal baby anyway.  I like stuff that's about drugs and
198 women and sex and cars and women and drugs and guitars and sex and drugs, I
199 mean like that's what's really IMPORTANT, ya know?  I mean like, who CARES 
200 about ethics and morality and all that stuff when you can get some just really
201 dynamite smoke from my buddy here, it'll like take the top of your head off,
202 ya know?  It's killer.  Let's do something really creative like get stoned and
203 watch MTV.  Or listen to my Cheech and Chong records.  Urp, urp urp.......

251 an ear too. I'd like to hear from you voice, perhaps if you're up to it,

262 Computer Nerd:  Have you ever heard of Unix?
263 Girl:  Sure I've heard of eunuchs, who hasn't.
264 Computer Nerd: What do you think of Unix?
265 G:   Eunuchs? Not nearly hard enough!
266 CN:   Really?   That's  the  first time I've heard Unix  called  "not  hard 
267 enough."
268 G:   Well, it's true I tell you.  I know.
269 CN:  You mean you've had experience with Unix?
270 G:   Sure, I've played with eunuchs for years.  But no progress, yet.
271 CN:  What's the problem been?
272 G:   They can't keep it up.  Not nearly long enough.
273 CN:   Well,  how long do you want them to keep it going?  A week,  a month, 
274 what?
275 G:   You must be joking.  An hour would do nicely.
276 CN:  You're not asking for much, are you?
277 G:   That's just what I told them.  I told them if they couldn't keep it up 
278 for  an hour,  to just forget the whole thing.   If they can't do it,  they 
279 oughtta just let me sleep.
280 CN:  But  that's  one of the best features!   You can tell  Unix  to  start 
281 something going anytime, even while you are asleep.
282 G:   What a terrible idea!  While I'm asleep?  When they finally get it up, 
283 I want to be wide awake enjoying it.
284 CN:  That's really not necessary.   Unix can do the job,  stop quietly, and 
285 leave everything just as it was before.  You won't be bothered.
286 G:   Actually,  I think I'd rather be bothered.  That's the whole point, if 
287 you know what I mean.
288 CN:   Oh,  you'll  eventually know what happened.   Unix can send you mail, 
289 telling you about what went on all night.  
290 G:   Why would eunuchs want to send me mail?
291 CN:   To tell you if there were any sticky problems during the night.  Unix 
292 might have trouble doing something.  There might be difficulty getting into 
293 somewhere.  There can be problems with protection.
294 G:    I  didn't  think  eunuchs could have "sticky  problems."   And  there 
295 shouldn't  be  any need for "protection."  And if there's  trouble  getting 
296 into "somewhere", why can't I just wake up and tell how I want it?
297 CN:   You can't stay up all night.   With Unix,  it can go on for hours and 
298 hours.  Days even.
299 G:    My  goodness,  I never knew!   But how long does it usually take  for 
300 eunuchs?
301 CN:  That depends totally on what you want to happen.
302 G:   But I have to ask eunuchs for it, right?
303 CN:  Anything you want, Unix can do.
304 G:   Oh.
305 CN:  And another thing about Unix. Tube-type things.  Call them pipes.  You 
306 can think of them as a connector.   When you get something out of Unix, you 
307 can put it anywhere you want.  How many places would you want it?
308 G:   Only three that I can think of.  Do I have to touch a "pipe."
309 CN:  Not with Unix.  It's all taken care of.  Just tell Unix where to stick 
310 it,  and everything will be done for you. 
311 G:   And stuff comes out of the pipe?  Eunuchs?  Just the way you'd expect?
312 CN:  It comes in spurts.
313 G:   So I've heard.  It usually does.  Where would I put it when it finally 
314 comes out of eunuchs?
315 CN:  In your box.
316 G:   What color is it?  
317 CN:  The stuff? It's white.  But occasionally it has green lines on it too. 
318 That's so it will be easier to look at.
319 G:   Green lines?  That's awful! Never heard of that before.
320 CN:  Don't worry.  If you don't like it, just ask for white.
321 G:   Do I have to take it out of my box and look at it?
322 CN:   That's  the  whole reason you've been fiddling with Unix.   It's  all 
323 there!
324 G:   Can't I just leave it in my box?      
325 CN: I suppose.  But you'll want to look at it, eventually.  That's half the 
326 fun.
327 G:   I can hardly wait.

346 ===================================================================
347 I awoke to the vibration of the plane comming in for a landing.
348 Moments later it bounced slightly as it touched down. I crawled out
349 of the sleeping bag, stowed it back where I found it, then reconnected
350 the air exchanger hose to the radar transmitter. 
351 A few minutes later, the plane came to a stop. The cargo hatched poped
352 open as I was scrambling to hide behind a large crate.  
353 "I don't know, the pilot said he was losing pressure in the radar transmitter,
354 probably just a bad seal." "Yeah, well you better make sure that it is
355 working right, 'cause he said there's gona be hell to pay if it croaks
356 over the atlantic. He's heading for some touchy areas, and that jammer's
357 gotta work, or he's gonna be in real trouble. And if he gets in trouble,
358 your life ain't gonna be worth even thinkin' about. Got it?" "Ah... yeah."
359 The nervous tech crawled into the compartment and started to pull the 
360 radar unit out of it slot, but then saw the hose clamp was loose where I
361 hadn't been able to properly tighten it down in time. "Ah ha! there's
362 where the problem is, some jerk didn't tighten the stupid hose down.
363 Quickly tightening it, he crawled back out. "Ah, it was just a loose
364 air hose is all, those guys in Portland can't do anything right. Where
365 they taken this bird anyway, overseas?" "Yeah, I overheard 'em say'n
366 something about Albino's, Elbano's, something like like." "Sounds a bit
367 strange to me, what's she haul'n?"  "Some VIP, Pam I think her name was."
368 "Gee, must be nice to have a private jet to fly anywhere ya want." "Yeah,
369 well you make sure those belly tanks are full, it's gonna be a long
370 flight." "Did you hear something?" "No, why" "I don't know, sounded like
371 a groan." "probably just the stuts settling." "Yeah, These ol planes......
372 I didn't hear any more as the cargo hatch was shut. Albainia? Oh lord,

398 Juggler: Nor am +I+ fond of deception.  I typed +++NOTHING+++ under your name
399 if that is what you are implying by your words.  My entry on the previous disk
400 covers lines 549-567, and absolutely nothing else.  If you are refering to the
401 entry on lines 546-548, I had assumed those were your words.  If they weren't,
402 I'm sorry to hear it.  But that doesn't excuse your rash accusation.  You may
403 be a Juggler, but you dropped the ball on this one.  I await an apology if you
404 were refering to the above mentioned series of lines, or a more lucid explan-
405 ation if you weren't.  I've enjoyed your work and thought that there must be
406 an individual with feeling behind it all.  But my opinion of your work aside,
407 I hope you will give me an explanation of your words.  Or else I must assume
408 that I am not the only Fool on this system.

411 Poem for Pat:
412 
413 Love is a feeling
414 Yet much much more
415 Love is a wanting
416 Yet much much more
417 
418 Sometimes I think it's wasted
419 on people
420 Who don't really care
421 
422 Yet I know
423 That if
424 I give loove,
425 I will 
426 Get back
427 What I share
428 
429      Goodbye,
430      Strings

432 JUGGLER: You seem to be a bit ticked off at 'the fool'. I don't understand,
433 since he didn't do anything against you, only rambled on about his car
434 and how upset and frustrated he was with it, then later countered a bit
435 of drivel with sarcastic drivel. Since it wasn't targeted at you
436 (I assume that you weren't the one splating the walls of the Inn with 
437 the ZZ Top mess). Why are you lambasting him? I would really like to
438 know, because it doesn't make sense to me. Or are you just trying to
439 find someone to expel your emotions at and the fool was handy?

442      Woke up with an uncompfortable feeling of groggyness and an ache in his
443 back.  'No wonder' he thought to himself when he realized he had been asleep
444 in his chair.  He remembered telling one of the incidents from his friend 
445 Themnax's early life and then listening to the music and poetry all around.
446      Snowrunner dreamed fitfully ware she was curled up under the table.  The
447 conversations around them had taken an unpleasent turn.  Not all of them.
448      One who was saddened by a turn of social fortunes was being offered con-
449 dolence as best can ever be in words.  Dreamtoucher realizing his ineptness at 
450 such things except by way of the dreams he shaped and sent, sighed but kept still.
451      'It was high time for a little air' he thought as he shoved back his chair
452 and levered himself up with his walkin stick.
453      Outside the sun was rising on a new day.

456   He reached into one of the pockets of his pants, pulling from it a small
457 pipe and a tinder box.  After a bit of fumbling the pipe glowed brightly and
458 he took a long draw on the stem.  He held the breath for a long time, then 
459 slowly exhale.  Best to leave such batles to the battle-worn, they are best
460 prepared for it.

463 piper:  thanks for the shoulder.  I've been dampening a few close shoulders
464 for the last three days, and I think I'm almost ready to stem the flood.  
465 Tonight we went downtown for dinner with two friends who spent the entire year
466 breaking up; it was terrifying and entertaining at the same time.  She and I
467 excused ourselves to the powder room; the guys, when we returned, were 
468 taciturn and somewhat morose, so she and I decided that we wouldnever, never,
469 never understand men.  Harrumph.  It'll be tough for a while, but I think
470 he and I are, after a year and a half, pretty much up on the other's ways
471 of working things out.  I'll grieve, he'll look at me and say, "When are
472 you leaving?" (a true romantic, no?), and then we'll probably remain on
473 good terms.  The rat.  I wish I had a reason to smack him, but he's too nice.
474 Guru of Bliss:  you are absolutely right about beginnings and endings.  I'm
475 not naive enough to believe that the world will actually disappear tomorrow
476 just because he and I have parted ways (not that you implied that I was; just
477 letting you know that I agree with your assertions).  I think that one of
478 my problems is seeing things too clearly.  I know I'll get over it, I know
479 I'll be happy again, I know that he's not the be-all and end-all of the
480 universe...knowing this, though, makes me impatient and frustrated.  Better,
481 perhaps, to not try too hard to forget; rather, remember the good and weep
482 for the cessation of that.  Thanks for your posting; I enjoyed the sentiment.

485       Trimmimng aside for the moment, I shall proceed with an attempt
486 at an explaination and an apology.
487 The one that is only in name "The Fool": What I had assumed (no puns)
488 was an attempt to to further your own goals was the one-line comment
489 below my entry. Seeing a comment I should have made, but didn't, and
490 under that flimsy thing I call my boarder looked too much like a lead
491 in for your offering of humor. Obviously, I have once again flown off
492 the provereal handle at the closest thing that looked like a link.
493 For whatever lible I have brought against you, I am sorry.
494 Maybe someday I'll learn that a name is only a name, and a positive
495 remark should be allowed to be given freely. (No matter how truthful
496 or painful.) For some reason I flet pased by when my words had been
497 spoken for me. I hope that in some way that this is acceptable.
498 Once again, I am sorry...
499 Cistop Mikey: Was that clear, or have I goofed once again?

508 Lets see, you didn't write the last line below your message, apparently
509 someone else did, so you assumed that whoever left the message following
510 that one did. Not a very good assumption to make around here with the
511 common problem of people using other peoples boarders and names.
512 Though I admit I had the advantage of knowing that the fool had only
513 entered the message body within his own boarders, and nothing else, so
514 I didn't see any connection. In going over it I guess i can see how it
515 could be mistaken as such if you made the assumtion that the previous
516 line had been entered by the fool. (No, I'm not the fool, I just happen
517 to observe the entry.)

529     EPISODE 1         "BLACKOUT""
530 
531 Portland was sweltering in the grip of a heat wave, and Joe was working
532 on a report on Solar Energy.  Outside the temperature registered a hot
533 91~ F.  All the heat you could want for free.
534      The office was deserted, an air-conditioner tomb, and a little after
535 seven, she decided to call it a day.  She packed her briefcase, rang for 
536 the elevator, and when it came she joined the sole occupant, a business-
537 man with a briefcase.
538      "Ground floor?"
539      "PLease," she said. He pushed the button and they began to descend,
540 wrapped in their mutual cocoons, staring at the dankness of the door 
541 opposite, neutral corners.  The music was the ordinary elevator music
542 tuned to KXL 95.5.  
543      Then their world went black...
544      "What the hell?"
545      They stood in stunned silence for several moments, for the music had
546 stopped as abruptly as the motion.  
547      "Oh, hell," the man said, and Vicky felt a tremor of panic.
548      "What do you think's happened...any idea?"
549      "Looks like Thomas Edison done it again."
550      "What do you mean?"
551      "An power outage. The heatwave.  All that air conditioning going 
552       full blast.  Another blackout like in '76.  Thats my guess."
553      "Oh no!" Vicky was getting upset. "What do we do now?"
554      "Find the alarm button, pronto.  I think the panel is right next to 
555       the door.  You got a match or a lighter?"
556      "Sorry."
557     It was no good waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dark, for the 
558 blackness was total.  No ray of light anywhere.
559      "I'll find it," he said.  She could sense him gropping around for 
560 the buttons.  She stepped back.  Suddenly, the silence was shattered by
561 a racous loud clang.  He rang nonstop for what seemed like an eternity,
562 shouted, banged on the door.  Nobady came.  Perhaps there was nobady in 
563 the building oto come.
