 40 Commodore 64 (my computer at the time).  Ah yes, loading a terminal
 41 program off of cassette tape, dialing manually and plugging in the handset
 42 into the back of the modem, and reading in 40 columns... Ack.  What was

 58 format my 10 meg drive, but it doesn't work with the old 10 meg IBM HD

 62 About Ghandi, he was fighting a different sort of war. One in which his 'side'
 63 was so far inferior in terms of weaponry, that they didn't stand much of a 
 64 chance. Guns and the knowledge of how to use them would have prevented Ghandi's
 65 people from ever having been in that position.

101 Yes, Pam was one of the few who had Sysop capabilities.  
102 Pam as an entity here in the Inn is no more. Pam as a person still exists.
103 She moved to Seattle a couple of years ago when she got a better job offer. 
104 She called for a few months after that, but for obvious reasons of the long
105 distance, that tappered off rather quickly. The last I heard from her was
106 July of '87 when she called to say goodby. I tried to convince her to stay
107 in contact, but for personal reasons she wanted to put Portland behind her.
108 Who knows, maybe one day she'll surprise us and leave a message.

111 Something to consider.  China is a nuclear power. They have appoximately 200
112 bombs.  This is a country who's leadership. Wantonly killed thousands of
113 people systamatically with forethought. No concern for the lives of those
114 people were given. They were an irritant, so they were killed. After all
115 the demontrators were advocating that those in power be removed from their
116 privaleged positions and be answerable to the people. 
117 It's just a bit scary to think that a leadership that has such little concern
118 over the live's of their own countrymen has the ability to launch 200 bombs
119 just because they are irritated at what some other country might do or say.
120 So what if the other country retaliates. What's a few lives when compared 
121 to the loss of the privleges of the leadership.

127  
128 well, personally I don't really think that the chinese will launch
129 at us, maybe. however, I am not so sure about ussr as a target;
130 the chinese-soviet war was so long ago, they might devide to make
131 a radiated zone around their northern border (so wat if they get
132 mongolia, they nothing but a bunch of nomads :-)).

244                  HANDGUNS...EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE ONE!!!
245                                  DEBATE - GUNS-- USA TODAY'S OPINION:
246     School's out. And kids killing time are shooting themselves and each 
247 other. Parents and children must be taught that guns aren't toys. They're 
248 deadly weapons. That's the surest way to keep our kids' summer from being a 
249 killing season.
250  OTHER VIEWS:
251     JOHN DARLING, former member of the board of directors of the Center to 
252 Prevent Handgun Violence: One child a day under 14 is accidentally shot to 
253 death every day in the United States. In Florida in the last two weeks, six 
254 children were shot, although not fatally. Firearms responsibility is your 
255 responsibility. Educating your children is a must, whether you own a firearm 
256 or not.
257     BOB MARTINEZ, governor of Florida: If we can pass legislation that makes 
258 just one parent act more carefully, that saves just one innocent child from 
259 tragedy, our efforts will be worthwhile. I cannot, and will not, accept 
260 anything less for the innocent children of our state.
261     STATE REP. HARRY JENNINGS, author of the Florida bill to punish parents 
262 who don't lock up loaded guns: "Something must be done to develop 
263 responsibility."
264     LEONARD J. SUPENSKI, chief of crime prevention, Baltimore County, Md., 
265 Police Department: "We need reasonable controls on firearms backed with 
266 realistic education aimed at reducing firearms misuse."
267     MATTHEW AMBERS, 10, friend of accidental shooting victim Erin Smith, 
268 Miramir, Fla.: "She plays a lot. She laughs. She's funny. I feel bad. I'm 
269 going to miss here."
270     ST. LOUIS, MO., Dorothy Williams, 27, teacher: "Parents should have some 
271 kind of responsibility. A child's life is very precious, and if one child a 
272 day is being killed, that's one child too many. I'm sure the parents would be 
273 distraught, but they had the ability to prevent the tragedy ..."
274     THATCHER, ARIZ., Louisa C. Ochoa, 50, beautician: "Something like that 
275 usually happens when the parents aren't around, and the kids knew they were 
276 not supposed to touch the gun. We keep our firearms locked up, and our kids 
277 went to gun-safety classes. But it's usually the kids' curiosity, not parents' 
278 negligence, that causes the accidents."
279     YARDLEY, PA., Jon Hilson, 53, TV sports producer: "As parents, we're 
280 responsible for a child who gets into the drinking closet, let alone the ammo 
281 closet. If my child were killed in my home with my gun, my grief is 
282 punishment. But if someone else's child were killed in my home, I would expect 
283 some type of punishment ..."
284      LEE ATWATER, head of National Republican Committee, specializing in "dirty
285 tricks":  "If we can just sell enough handguns, cigarettes, and beer to enough 
286 of our country's young people, I'm sure we can eventually achieve a Republican
287 Majority in the House."
288                                                                              
289                 KEMP VOWS TO PURGE HUD GREED:-6/19/89
290     Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp - who vowed Sunday to 
291 "reform and overhaul" HUD - faces the nation's mayors Monday. Tuesday, other 
292 HUD officials will meet with the mayors to debate the agency's future. The 
293 mayors' stake in HUD is huge: It is a conduit for much of the federal aid 
294 flowing to cities. During the Reagan years, HUD's spending was cut by more 
295 than two-thirds.
296     The Justice Department is investigating real estate profits in the growing 
297 furor HUD. On Sunday: The New York Times reported that over half the $12 
298 million New York got from a HUD fund went to projects pushed by Sen. Alfonse 
299 D'Amato; and New York Newsday reported an ex-HUD official got a $125,000-a-
300 year job from people with whom he split a $17 million profit from a HUD deal.
301 KEMP VOWS TO PURGE `THE GREEDY':-6/19/89
302     Jack Kemp, Housing and Urban Development secretary, promised Sunday to run 
303 the department "with an eye on help to the needy and get the greedy out of the 
304 process." HUD is beset by influence-peddling and embezzlement scandals. 
305 Charles Dempsey, a former HUD inspector general, says Kemp is moving in the 
306 right direction and that Congress shares blame for the problem.
307     New woes at the Department of Housing and Urban Development surface almost 
308 daily. The Justice Department is probing real estate agents' profits from the 
309 sale of foreclosed houses. Missing: up to $20 million. Also under scrutiny is 
310 the steering of HUD subsidies for renovation of low-income housing to 
311 politically connected developers and consultants.
312     More than half the $12 million New York state received from a special HUD 
313 fund went to projects pushed by GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, The New York Times 
314 reported Sunday. Also, New York Newsday reported Sunday that former HUD 
315 official Joseph Monticciolo got a $125,000-a-year job from businessmen who 
316 shared in HUD contract profit.
317 FINGERS POINTING IN HUD FIASCO:-6/20/89
318     Some observers say former Department of Housing and Urban Development 
319 Secretary Samuel Pierce followed the Reagan credo, taking jobs away from HUD 
320 employees and contracting them out as part of the "privatization" of 
321 government.
322     The Housing and Urban Development Dept. was created 1965 to oversee urban 
323 renewal and housing, and mortgage insurance for the elderly, poor and 
324 handicapped. At the center of the HUD scandal: Lawyer Sam Pierce, Reagan's HUD 
325 secretary and the sole Reagan Cabinet member in office for eight years. Dubbed 
326 "Silent Sam," Pierce kept a low profile during his HUD tenure.
327     The emerging portrait of mismanagement, favoritism, fraud and influence-
328 peddling affects the 4.3 million people helped by the Department of Housing 
329 and Urban Development, say observers. Example: Boston has about 23,000 
330 homeless - triple the number on the streets just a few years ago - and only 
331 1,200 vacancies in the city's 18,000 public housing units.
332     Since April, Housing and Urban Development scandals being investigated 
333 include: Maryland real estate agent Marilyn Harrell admitted taking $5.5 
334 million after representing HUD in the sale of foreclosed homes; in Texas, Reba 
335 Louise Lovell was indicted for stealing $2.5 million from the sale of 55 
336 Dallas homes; and the U.S. attorney in Denver is investigating the loss of $1 
337 million.
338     Washington, D.C., investigators are looking for a lawyer and former 
339 Housing and Urban Development agent who disappeared a year ago. More than $3 
340 million might be missing. In another probe: Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y.,

345 Early report on BATMAN from someone who has already seen it: Moi.
346  
347 Keaton: An unconventional choice, natch, but he certainly had high 
348 aspirations for this character to work.  While, for the most part,
349 Keaton maintains the integrity of the character, even he admits that
350 the project was just too big for him to handle.  Strictly on a 
351 psychological level, I would have to say that this only adds to the
352 character, as Wayne is portrayed as schizophrenic (sp) in the film,
353 (film), plummeting into the character of the Batman whenever a crime
354 is committed in his presence, regardless of whether or not he is
355 wearing the costume.
356  
357  
358 The Costume:  Initially, I found the costum somewhat lackluster, equippred as  
359 it was with false muscles and lifts (Keaton is only 5" 5').  However, the
360 lifts and muscles are explained away in the film as metal boots (for combat) 
361 and teflon armor plating, respectively.  Overall, the only real fault
362 with it was that the cowl and cape are connected, preventing a great
363 deal of head mobility.  But still, an admirable job considering that
364 they had to create something that could not possibly exist in the real
365 world and do it convincingly.
366  
367 Nicholson:  What can be said that isn't already established in the 
368 subconscious of all who know Nicholson's style.  He steals the film,
369 presenting the Joker as much more a tragic, operatic character than
370 Ceaser Romero (from (guh) the BBatman TV series) ever thought of.
371 Yes, pained, and tragic, to the bitter finale on the rooftops of the
372 Gotham Cathedral, when, locked in Mortal Combat, the two adversaries...

377 have much patience with the plodding style of Elfman, but he carries it off.

434                            DEBATE - POLLUTERS-- USA TODAY'S OPINION:
435     The country's pollution is as close as your back yard. Congress is working 
436 on new environmental laws. This report will help it control more of the 
437 pollutants that foul our air and contaminate 595 waterways across the country. 
438 We all need to know who's polluting our communities before we can clean up 
439 this mess. Or end it.
440  OTHER VIEWS:
441     DICK FLAVIN, writer and satirist: The age of pollution awareness is upon 
442 us. Thanks to the Environmental Protection Agency we can now tell which 
443 polluters are poisoning the environment without ever having to set foot 
444 outside in the environment. It's an issue who's time has come. You can smell 
445 it in the air.
446     PATRICK COX, political and economic analyst: The press, in general, has 
447 fallen in line with environmental reactionaries. Today, any violation of 
448 rights can be justified simply by couching it in ecological rhetoric. Anyone 
449 who questions the apocalyptic obsessions of the true believers is dismissed as 
450 an enlightened assassin of Mother Earth.
451     WILLIAM D. FAY, Clean Air Working Group: "These are toxic chemicals; some 
452 of them carcinogenic. But they are part of the process by which our economy 
453 runs. We're not going to eliminate them."
454     WILLIAM REILLY, EPA administrator: "The information in this national 
455 report will no doubt raise concern about toxic releases. This is exactly what 
456 it is meant to do."
457     JEFFERY VAN, Chemical Manufacturers Association: "Anyone who says you can 
458 make a link between these numbers and health effects is misleading you."
459     HARBOR CITY, CALIF., Forescee H. Rowles, 32, college instructor: "Air 
460 pollution ... is caused by a combination of oil refineries, cars, the airline 
461 and trucking industries, and buses that are diesel fueled. I'm a native 
462 Californian, and I have watched the problem get worse. The saying, `Don't 
463 breathe deep,' used to be a joke around here. Now, it's serious."
464     CEDAR FALLS, IOWA, Harry Slife, 66, retired broadcast executive: "We're in 
465 pretty good shape in this area. But in the state, the biggest problem is 
466 groundwater pollution. The concern is that the drinking water supply will 
467 ultimately be affected by chemicals that come from agricultural use. There is 
468 already some evidence of contaminated water from wells."
469      LEE ATWATER, head of the Republican National Committee:  "If we can just 
470 release enough radiation and toxic wastes into the nation's air and water 
471 supply to give cancer to some liberal Democrats, then maybe we can finally
472 be the majority party in the House."
473                                                                         
474                          FIREWORKS HURT 10,000 IN 1988:-6/21/89
475     In 1988, 10,000 Americans suffered injuries from fireworks. The American 
476 Academy of Opthalmology said this week that more than half of those were 
477 children younger than 16, and many had serious eye injuries. The academy 
478 recommended safety tips for using fireworks this summer. On the list: wear 
479 safety glasses when using fireworks; and don't let kids use fireworks without 
480 adult supervision.
481                                                                              
482                         FIRMS WANT TIPS ON FUEL PLAN:-6/21/89
483     The oil and auto industries hope President Bush's clean-air legislation - 
484 that focuses on alternative fuels - will explain how to sell fuel and vehicles 
485 that consumers might not want. The Environmental Protection Agency says the 
486 answer is in the future price of methanol and industry's determination to make 
487 the program work.
488     Increased use of methanol will reduce auto emissions of chemicals that 
489 form ozone, the key ingredient in smog, says the Bush administration in its 
490 clean-air proposal. Methanol, a form of alcohol made from natural gas or coal, 
491 is thought by many experts to burn cleaner than gas, the primary source of 
492 smog agents.
493     If methanol were produced today, it would cost 72 cents to $1.15 a gallon, 
494 the American Petroleum Institute estimates. But vehicles travel only about 
495 half as far on a gallon of methanol as on gas. The comparable per-mile cost 
496 would be $1.30 to $2.07 a gallon. Environmental Protection Agency officials 
497 say the price of methanol will fall as it is produced on a large scale.
498     Sale quotas for cars using alternate fuels would be set for all automakers 
499 under President Bush's clean-air program. They would probably would be tied to 
500 a company's share of a targeted market. Car makers would get some flexibility: 
501 Those that exceed quotas would accrue credits they could then trade with 
502 competitors.
503

505 "Liberal Democrats"  should be "enough".  sorry)

609    WP   06/22/89 MARY McGRORY The Truth According to Gregg
610  
611    The Iran-contra scandal, which has spawned so many contradictions and
612 ironies, is going to give us another new ethical concept, "truth-under-the
613 circumstances." That is not the same as "the whole" and "nothing but," but it
614 will do for Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.), who voted to confirm Donald P. Gregg
615 as ambassador to South Korea and told us why.
616    Gregg's statements, which, incidentally, were given under oath, Robb said,
617 were "as reasonable and believable as I think we could expect under the
618 circumstances."
619    What the "circumstances" were, Robb did not explain. What he probably meant
620 was that only some crazed purist would imagine that a lifelong CIA man, trained
621 in the "Eyes Only" and "Need to Know" tradition of "the company," would spill
622 the beans on what he knew about Iran-contra and what he told his boss when he
623 was then-Vice President Bush's national security adviser. The literal truth, an
624 fool could see, would only have killed the nomination and distressed the
625 president. Get lost, Diogenes.
626    Gregg's version of events was sometimes, as Robb, a conspicuous contra fan,
627 admitted, "very difficult to comprehend." The Republicans on the Senate Foreign
628 Relations Committee, who voted solidly for the nominee because they found the
629 opposition "partisan," had trouble, too. Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said
630 part of Gregg's tales "certainly strains belief."
631    But the Republicans stood strong partly it seemed because they thought that
632 Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who stalked Gregg down pages of typed questions,
633 was really after Bush. This idea was pushed hard by Sen. Mitch McConnell
634 (R-Ky.), Gregg's chief defender. He pointed out that several other diplomatic
635 appointees who were much more involved in Iran-contra had "sailed through" the
636 committee, and he said it was Gregg's "closeness to Bush" that activated the
637 Democrats.
638    Gregg had woven a thick carpet of "plausible deniability" around each weak
639 spot in his testimony. Many found more denial than plausibility in much of what
640 he said. A secretary typed "copter-supply" instead of "contra supply"; his CIA
641 buddy Felix Rodriguez had misled him about his relations with Oliver L. North;
642 North had made a misleading entry in his notebook about a meeting with Gregg. H
643 never wavered in his insistence that he communicated to Bush his guilty
644 knowledge about illicit gun-running only through The New York Times four months
645 after he heard from Rodriguez that there was another Watergate in the making.
646    The amount of information Gregg withheld from Bush was of such volume that h
647 could have been reasonably asked whether he would, as ambassador, tell the
648 president if the Commies were coming over the border. But only Sen. Paul S.
649 Sarbanes (D-Md.) bothered to point out that Gregg's record for being Bush's eye
650 and ears was pretty poor.
651    The other two Democrats who defected to Bush were Terry Sanford (N.C.) and
652 Claiborne Pell (R.I.). Pell had originally begged bush to withdraw Gregg, but h
653 hates a scrap and went along. In an embarrassed post-vote news conference,
654 Cranston suggested that Sanford was afraid "the path would lead to Bush."
655    Sanford confirms this and adds to the "comparative truth" theory: "If Gregg
656 was lying, he was lying to protect the president, which is different from lying
657 to protect himself." Sanford does not believe in revisiting Iran-contra - "My
658 own view is to leave it to history to find out the true facts."
659    Other Democrats agree. They are scared stiff of the issue. As their
660 Iran-contra committee walked in fear of turning up impeachable evidence against
661 Ronald Reagan, Senate Democrats pale at the thought of digging up actionable
662 dirt on Bush. They echo the GOP caution that the country couldn't stand the
663 trauma - even though the Republic survived handily when Richard M. Nixon hit th
664 road. Besides - here's the clincher - before you hurt Bush, think of the
665 consequences.
666    Cranston met many jibes in the ~rcloakroom while he was struggling to rally
667 p
anti-Gregg votes. "You trying to get us Dan Quayle, Cranston?"
668    The new House Democratic whip, William H. Gray III (Pa.), said the 12 to 7
669 vote showed that the Senate is "letting yesterday be yesterday, forget it."
670  
671    "I don't think that is necessarily good politics," he adds.
672    But Senate Democrats think it is. Possibly they were persuaded by the happy 
673 endings for the affair's most prominent alumni. Reagan got the Order of the 
674 Bath from Queen Elizabeth II the other day. And Bush, who they all thought was 
675 so pathetic this time last year, stands at 73 percent in the polls. Neither 
676 came clean about Iran-contra. So why should Bush's ambassador to South Korea? 
677 Who cares? Let's settle for "truth-under the circumstances." It's all we're 
678 going to get.
679                                                                            
680                         THE RICH GET RICHER:-6/22/89
681     An annual survey by Financial World magazine says the median income of the 
682 top 100 Wall Street earners tripled in 1988 to $15 million, from $5 million in 
683 1987. Topping the list: indicted junk-bond king Michael Milken, who made 
684 between $180 million and $199 million, FW says. That sum is being withheld by 
685 Milken's former employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., pending a court 
686 decision.
687                                                                             
688                         BUSH BACKS TAX BREAK TO EXXON:-6/22/89
689     The Bush administration said it opposed a bill to deny a tax deduction to 
690 Exxon Corp. for Alaskan oil spill clean-up costs. It's a "fundamental 
691 principle of business taxation, that ordinary and necessary business expenses

694                     What's "ordinary and necessary" about the Alaska oil spill?
695 OIL-SPILL SPENDING LIMIT OK'D:-6/22/89
696     State laws that place no limit on what oil companies must pay to clean up 
697 a big oil spill and compensate victims would be preempted under a bill 
698 approved by the House Merchant Marines and Fisheries committee Wednesday. The 
699 bill now goes to the House.
700     A bill approved Wednesday by the House Merchant Marines and Fisheries 
701 Committee would limit an oil company's financial liability for an oil spill to 
702 $60 million unless gross negligence is proved. Remaining cleanup, compensation 
703 and related costs would come out of a fund that oil companies pay into through 
704 a 1.3-cents-per-barrel tax.
705     Congress has tried for 14 years to pass a comprehensive oil spill 
706 liability law, but has always stalled on language that preempted state laws.

745 is, except perhaps H.C.  Hagbard, you have a private communication
746 channel available perhaps?
747 	As for the planned Milch Toast and Commie Social, all I have
748 to say is that some Secret Societies are MUCH more useful than others.
749 What do you get when you advance in your SS?  Me, I get something

751 	And complaining about my low demise rate?  Why, it was a
752 piece of cake.  I mean, really.  We haven't even started the MISSION
753 yet.  Just a few interruptions/emergency assignments got in our way,
754 that's all.  Nothing to be worried about.  This mission will be fun.
755 The Computer says so.  Can you doubt the Computer?  Of course, there
756 might be some accidental executions, falling at 1000 feet, berserk

768    Sorry Milch, I have a hot date with my fiance' Sunday.  Will try
769 to make it in the future, though.  How about next week?
770  
771    If you catch me around town, well, look for a new 89 silver-frost
772 Sentra with a small dent on the trunk and the rear "Nissan" sticker
773 missing.  Chances are, you'll probably hear me coming before you
774 see me ;->) remember, hearing is believing!  Someday, I'll get an
775 amp for my radio - maybe just a little one...'ya know, around
776 80 watts per channel?  Little spendy for TWO amps, though - I have
777 a 4-way.  I figure if I can't have a nice looking car that moves
778 100 mph in excess of the federal speed limit, I can at least hae
779 a decent stereo in the thing.
780  
781    Say, does anyone want a slightly used 89 Sentra with low miles,
782 good stereo, and the "New" 12-valve Nissan motor?  $189.98 a month>
783  
784    Whatever you do, don't buy one unless you plan on making some
785 major investments.  Thing has been in the shop twice with only
786 10K miles on it.  Drives me nuts.  Now I think I need an alignment
787 job done on it.  It's worse than having a child!  It would
788 be easier to simply feed it my paycheck!

817               It COULD happen here........BUSH RUMOR PUSHES DOLLAR DOWN:-6/23/8
818     The dollar sank in wild trading, helped by a rumor that President Bush had 
819 been shot. The White House quickly denied the rumor. Traders also cited a lack 
820 of buying interest, plus the sale of dollars by central banks to prop up the 
821 British pound. But many traders say the weakness is a lull rather than a 
822 fundamental change in attitude toward the dollar.
823     President J. Danforth Quayle.  Think about it.
824                                                                              
825               It DID happen there........OIL SPILL TOUCHES ALL ALASKANS:-6/23/8
826     The Exxon Valdez oil spill - which as of this week has soiled 727 miles of 
827 Alaskan shoreline - has forced residents of that state to think hard about 
828 their environmental treasures.Gov. Steve Cowper: "There's been a reassessment 
829 of values by most Alaskans."
830     Alaska politicians, reviewing the effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, 
831 are wondering how a state that gets 85 percent of its revenues from oil 
832 concessions keep itself running and yet demand respect and environmental 
833 responsibility from big oil. Alaskans know they are married to the industry - 
834 each gets a yearly oil dividend - $826.93 last year.
835     Three months after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, 
836 Alaska, the destruction goes on. The oil isn't spreading any more, but the way 
837 it keeps sinking and resurfacing makes the cleanup tough, say conservation 
838 officials. The death toll so far: 25,688 birds, 808 sea otters and 84 eagles. 
839 Salmon seasons have been delayed or limited.
840     Environmental Protection Agency scientists this week began an experiment 
841 spreading a chemical mixture filled with oil-eating bacteria on the beaches of 
842 Alaska's Prince William Sound fouled by the Exxon Valdez tanker oil spill. 
843 Science News magazine reports in its June 25 issue that the tests will compare 
844 mixtures of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers for oil-devouring 
845 capabilities.
846     On Friday, weather permitting, the temporarily repaired Exxon Valdez 
847 tanker will be towed out of Prince William Sound, Alaska, headed for a $25 
848 million repair job in San Diego, the Coast Guard said.
849 OIL CONTINUES TO WRECK HAVOC:-6/23/89
850     Three months after the Exxon Valdez tanker ripped open and dumped 11 
851 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound, the destruction goes 
852 on. The oil isn't spreading any more, but the way it keeps sinking and 
853 resurfacing still makes the cleanup tough, says Robert Luch, a conservation 
854 official in Valdez. The death toll as of this week: 25,688 birds, 808 sea 
855 otters and 84 eagles.
856     
857  EPA ENLISTS BACTERIA IN BATTLE:
858     Environmental Protection Agency scientists thys week began an experiment 
859 spreading a chemical mixture filled with oil-eating bacteria on the beaches of 
860 Alaska's Prince William Sound fouled by the Exxon Valdez tanker oil spill. 
861 Science News magazine reports in its June 25 issue that the tests will compare 
862 mixtures of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers for oil-devouring 
863 capabilities.
864                                                                              
865                               EXECUTIONS CONTINUE IN CHINA:-6/23/89
866     The execution toll from China's crackdown on dissidents mounted Thursday, 
867 bringing an outcry from Washington for tougher action against the Chinese. 
868 Seven men were executed in Beijing for burning army vehicles. In the town of 
869 Jinan, 17 people were executed; some died for crimes linked to the protests, 
870 others for unrelated crimes.
871     The executions of pro-democracy demonstrators won't cause the United 
872 States to escalate its war of words against China. Secretary of State James 
873 Baker said the United States would not impose new sanctions on China. Bush has 
874 ordered an end to arms sales, cessation of government contacts and called on 
875 world lenders not to help China. Baker said the limited sanctions were 
876 appropriate.
877     China's response to world-wide outrage over the execution of pro-democracy 
878 demonstrators remained unchanged Thursday. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li 
879 Jinhua said other countries were being "unwise" in trying to dictate to China 
880 about domestic trouble.
881     While the furor about the executions in China might be new, the method 
882 isn't. "The death penalty continues to be used extensively" in China, said 
883 Amnesty International, the human rights organization. Execution - normally by 
884 a gunshot to the back of the head - is used for political and common crimes. 
885 Amnesty has documented more than 1,500 executions in China since 1983.
886     Chinese students in the United States say they are having a hard time 
887 coming up with cash to pay phone bills for the "freedom faxes" to China after 
888 the Tiananmen Square slaughter. Some copiers were cranking day and night 
889 sending news articles, photos and editorials giving the U.S. view of events. 
890 Now, bills are arriving: At Stanford University, the latest bill ran more than 
891 $3,000.
892                                                                             
893                       DOE PUSHING NUCLEAR PLANTS:-6/23/89
894     Nuclear plants at Seabrook in New Hampshire and Shoreham on Long Island, 
895 N.Y., will overcome obstacles and will operate, predicted Mary Ann Novak, 
896 acting assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the Department of Energy. She 
897 said that nuclear power fit well with the energy policy now being written 
898 aiming at a reasonably priced and environmentally benign energy supply.
899     New nuclear plants will be ordered in the next five to seven years, said 
900 Mary Ann Novak, an assistant secretary at the Department of Energy. DOE will 
901 try to convince the public of the advantages of nuclear energy, she said. 
902 Novak spoke at a conference in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the U.S. Global 
903 Strategy Council. She said power demand is twice what utilities are planning 
904 for.
905                       HUD INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE:-6/23/89
906     After HUD insured $67 million in mortgages for eight Twin Cities housing 
907 projects, two defaulted, two are being refinanced and two are marginal, 
908 reports the Minneapolis Starand Tribune. Also: After local HUD officials 
909 declined to get involved in a 68-unit project, federal HUD officials overrode 
910 them when developers hired ex-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's nephew as 
911 a lobbyist.
