25 that was making such a horrible sound.
26 All Mojo could make out in the dim
27 light was a vague shadow of what
28 appeared to be an enormous creature.
29 Ignoring his fear (and his instincts)
30 , Mojo stepped toward the creature.
31 Then suddenly, with a thunderous
32 crash and a brilliant flash, the thing
33 disappeared.
34 
35      Mojo froze in his tracks, his
36 mind blank.  Suddenly an astonishing
37 thought permeated his conciousness.

86 Okay, I'm asked to back up my words. Just digging around for a few quotes on the AIDS question... but first, let me
87 remind you something. You speak of a God who is so mean he would let people die. Isn't that just cruel? Well, your minds
88 have to *expand* a little. Think! Death doesn't mean anything to God! Just to you! Why should he care if you're in a 
89 bodily state or a spiritual state? He used people's deaths constantly as a source of warning to others. How about all
90 the firstborn in Egypt? Lots of lots of BABIES killed, as a very strong message? Hey I can't put myself in a position to
91 condemn him for that. How can we say He would be too cruel? Death is just a transition to him, like childhood to adult-
92 hood.
93 
94 Also, naturally this question about God at least *allowing* this disease to come forth is limited to those who believe
95 in Him in the first place. Which may be few noways I admit (we've become so modern dontcha know), and old-fashioned. But
96 I guess we'll all find out sooner or later. The lucky ones will know sooner...
97 
98 Anyway, how 'bout some of God's (or Jesus') feelings on the entire morality of the '80s question:
99 "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultry, and he who marries a woman divorced from her
100 husband commits adultry."
101 
102 "...And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to go through life maimed than with two hands
103 go to hell."
104 
105 "As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the son of man (the end days). They ate, they drank, they
106 married... until the day when Noah entered the ark and the flood *killed* them all... whoever seeks to gain his life 
107 will lose it. But whoever loses his life will preserve it."
108 
109 And think about this one:
110 "...But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet and is teaching and
111 and beguiling her servents to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. I gave her time to repent, but 
112 she refuses to repent of her immorality. Behold, *I will throw her on a sickbed, and those who commit adultry with her 
113 I will throw into great tribulation*, unless they repent of their doings; and I will strike her children dead."
114 
115 Oh, well that's enough of that. My point is... it's very very possible. Why not? Why do we ignore it? Human nature I
116 guess, they did in Gomorrah, and in Noah's time, and we do it know. I can't obviously profess to know for a fact that
117 it's Gods punishment on the world. But for those who believe in God, take a second and think... isn't it possible?
118 
119 After this, I'd love to take on you poor, near-sighted people, like Pen-Name, who are so taken up in the world that
120 they can't see the truth sitting right in front of their noses...

125 Andy: 	YOU want to talk truth??  Okay, buddy-boy, we'll talk some truth.
126 
127 	In the continuing days of "cristianity", we see some ludicrous, if not
128 	sickening, statements and actions of hipocracy.
129 	Take the mormons.  The latter day saints.  A religion founded mainly
130 	on the position and stature of it's members in society.  And I'm not
131 	talking about ethical or moral standings, I'm talking about financial
132 	standings, power standings, standing that, set forth in the bible they
133 	follow, are abbhored.
134 	But that's not the worst of it. 
135 	Once into this tight circle of switchbacks, they rufuse then to be
136 	counted amoung the rest of society.  Theirs' is a tight circle indeed.
137 	The values shown in that circle, even though (and maybe especially 
138 	since) they practice much the same as the more established religions,
139 	they hold their order to be more of a social club.
140 	But wait, it gets worse, and worse.
141 	This same bible is racist and malicious.  This same bible teaches that
142 	people, who's only "sin" is to be of another skin hue, are to be feared,       
143         hated, and worst of all, refuted.  Without exception.
144 
145 	I won't tell you what your truth should be.  And in the same breath,
146 	I'll tell you that you CAN'T dictate mine.  Everyone to their own
147 	beliefs.  None good, none bad.  None right, none wrong.  
148 	Only different.
149                                                            PEN NAME

152 PEN NAME:
153 
154   A few comments on your above speech.
155 
156   First of all, about looking at christianity through the Church of Latter Day
157 Saints.  The mormon religion is not one founded on christian beliefs.  
158 Christians believe in accepting Christ as their personal saviour - a one on one
159 relationship.  They believe in doing this through Jesus, the Son of God.  The
160 mormons do not believe in this same relationship.  Also, their 'bible' you 
161 refer to is not the christian Bible.  Oh, it certainly CONTAINS the christian 
162 Bible, but there are whole BOOKS that they add to it.  The new book this 
163 results in is called the Book of Mormon.  This is not compatible for comparison
164 with the christian Bible.
165 
166   "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this
167 book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues
168 that are written in this book:
169 
170   "And if any man shall take away from the  words of the book of this prophecy,
171 God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city,
172 and  from the things which are  written in this book."
173 
174   Also, about God being cruel to let people die.  At one time man had the 
175 opportunity to live forever in harmony with God; but he blew it.  If God 
176 wanted, he could keep us from living at all.  Remember, it's MAN'S sin that
177 brought about death, not God's.
178 
179                                                              An observer
180 (^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)(^)
181 (It sure seems interesting to me that such passions are aroused by those who don't
182 believe in God when His name his mentioned. Something like the closer to the truth...
183 the more it hurts?
184 Also, Pen Name, there IS a right and wrong. There has to be. Your belief is that 
185 there is no God. You're either right or you're wrong. You'll find out when it's too 
186 late to change your mind. But your near-sightedness is blatantly displayed when you 
187 criticize all belief in God and Christianity through one false religion.
188 
189 My neighbor is a thief, therefore my whole neighborhood is full of thieves!
190 
191 And of course you cannot see, that since there is good and evil, God and Satan, the 
192 latter naturally tries to cover up the truth by letting all sorts of other religions 
193 come about which distort the one true faith and allow people like you to say they 
194 must all be false since *that* one surely is.

197 
198 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
199 It's also interesting how pasionately YOU respond when YOUR beliefs are
200 questioned. I see no real insights there other then the normal response
201 anyone gives when the basis of his or her belief is questioned by another.
202 It is a perfectly normal response and has nothing to do with the truth or
203 non truth of either party's belief structure. It is simply the passionate
204 response to the need to maintain that belief when it is questioned.
205 h""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
206 
207 "When in danger, or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout."
208 
209 	Is that what you say I am doing fred? Running in circles? Screaming abnd shouting? Is that what you call
210 someone who is simply trying to spread the word about a danger we must all concern ourselves with? I was alarmed by
211 the apparent head-in-sand attitude that some people were displaying here. I am glad to see that is not the prevalent
212 attitude. You yourself entered a very thoughtful message on the subject. While the message was far longer and more in
213 depth than my initial messages, no one accused you of screaming and shouting. Please don't use that tone with me.
214 	Pen Name, while I can't agree with your stands on religion, I have no quarrel with that. It was the same
215 attitude I speak of above that I saw in your words that concerned me. Apparently there are very definite opinions on
216 the subject, which is good. It shows me that people are thinking about issues that concern us all. I just cringe when
217 I hear people say 'Wait and it will go away.' Truce is fine, but I hardly think one is needed. Debates, as always,
218 raise the temperature of Backwater, but the seldom transcend   (they seldom) electronic and
219 phosphorus world.
220 
221 	The religious debate has arisen again. Isn't it interesting how everything always returns to religion? Consider
222 this small model of the universe:
223    At the lowest level of the model there is sentient life. Simple single-celled life forms that do exist and do
224 propogate and do strive for survival. They are the base. Anything above this level is nearly uncomprehensible to those
225 at that level. Sounds simple enough? Then comes the second level. Add to sentient life mobility. Locomotion, migration,
226 movement. Most all animals are at this level. To level one creatures these creatures with mobility might seem like
227 gods, if the level one creatures could consider such a concept. And now level three. We add Reason to the model. 
228 The ability to reason seperates Man from the lower animals. Men rule beasts because of reason. To these beasts, Man
229 must appear god-like. Level four encompasses all the lower levels. It adds Eternal living to Reason, Mobility, and 
230 Sentient behaviour. Eternal living is the ability to live in the past, the present, and the future. You may scoff at
231 this, but who are we to say that this level does not exist as certainly as any of the lower levels refuse to
232 acknowledge or understand the higher levels? I do not submit this as the ultimate truth, but I do submit this as a
233 model to expand our own views by. If anything is can be a tool used to try and understand that there are concepts in
234 the universe that we do not understand, but that certainly does not mean the concepts do not exist as concrete fact.
235 (That should be anything it not anything is)
236 							French Toast

239 Honi soit qui mal pense - Evil be to him who thinks evil.
240 Do not forget the words of Erasmus and the Enchiridion...
241 __________________________________________________________________
242 French Toast, you have some real good points there. It also brings to mind one of the basics of the religious question:
243 creationism vs. evolution.
244 I present thus: to believe that evolution is the cause of our present condition is absolutely ludicrous.
245 Imagine, the idea of a glob of goo, or gasses, or whatever starting to form and take shape... and suddenly! A cell!
246 Now we all know cells are simple to make, so no problem for some gasses to get together and make one simple cell right?
247 
248 Well, there's one thing wrong. Cells are far from simple. In fact, they're some of the most complex things in the
249 universe.
250 
251 But, for arguments sake, let's assume the some cell somehow got formed from the masses and sat around waiting to meet
252 another cell similarly created by accident. Being lonely, they get together and decide to mate. This being fun, they 
253 keep at it until they form a fish.
254 
255 The fish gets tired of being in the water, so he crawls on land and becomes a dinosaur. Naturally this is all silly, but
256 let's find an easy way to explain it. Hmmmm... I know! Let's say it took place over a jillion years! Yes that's it. 
257 Heck, if we let this rock sit here long enough chances are it will turn into something!
258 
259 It's amazing how easily humans are convinced of something through repetition. We have learned about evolution, so it
260 must be true. Scientists say it's so, after all.
261 
262 But look at the facts. Something had to start it. And even zillions of years cannot create sophistication in nature 
263 enough to produce an animal-type organism. Look at your eyeball. A miracle of modern creation. Think all those nerve
264 endings and dazzling designs could have happened by accident? Look how complex your skin is, your hair even. What, 
265 nature's animals kept getting kicked in the guts and killed off, so she decided to make rib cages to protect all the 
266 vital organs?  C'MON!
267 
268 Give me one good argument for evolution. Find me the missing link (ever wonder why that's the ONLY one that's missing?)
269 or prove that two zillion years can create a single cell.
270 
271 It's impossible. So, something had to create us. And, like French Toast said above, why should us humans feel like we
272 have the last rights to being "higher up?"
273 
274 Ah, it always does come back to religion, because that is what the basis of all life is! What's more important than
275 where we'll end up spending our eternal life? Surely not next month's bill or last night's great sex?
276 
277 A blink of an eye in the total look of time, and we can't stop and think about what we're going to be looking at after
278 the eye is done blinking.
279 
280 Anyway, c'mon Pen Name. Tell me how we evolved, and make sense. Quadrillions of years aren't the answer either.

283 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
284 Andy: I usually stay out of these arguments, but this time, I think I'll add
285   my thoughts to the confusion.  First of all, if you believe in the all
286   powerful God, how can you say that evolution is impossible?  I realise
287   that "God" and "Evolution" are blaspheme in the same sentence to some,
288   but think about this: the stories in the Bible tell us that through
289   God, *anything* and *everything* is possible.  For example, Christ turned
290   water into wine at a wedding; the whole world was flooded with water in
291   forty days; Lazaras arose from the dead; Moses parted the sea; and the
292   biggy for us Christians, Christ arose, as it was foretold, after being
293   creully beaten, tortured and crucified.  He arose three days after being
294   placed and sealed in a tomb donated by another believer.  These are hard
295   to believe, it is true, but your Bible tells us all about them.  They were
296   not impossible for our God.
297        With such a record of *impossible* feats, don't you think that evolution
298   might just have a chance of happening?  You must remember that the Bible is
299   MAN's *interpretation* of God's word.  Man interprets everything that he sees
300   and hears, so that he can understand the world around him; then he writes it
301   all down, with whatever emotional prejudice he might have attached unknowingly.
302   Just because the Bible *says* that the world was created in six *days*, how do
303   we know that?  Man wasn't created until the last day, so who told us how long
304   it took, and how sure can we be of the actual measurement of time?  (By the
305   way, who wrote Genenis?  I can't remember.)  Could it be possible that the
306   author took a little literary license and added a little more mystery to the
307   story than was really there?  How long was the story told from generation to
308   generation before it was written down?
309        As you may have guessed, I tend to believe that God created the Heavens
310   and the Earth, but not quite in the time scale suggested.  As with all works
311   of Man, I take the Bible with a few grains of salt.  Yes, there is much truth
312   to be found, but a lot, like any good painting, script, etc., is left up to
313   interpretation.  I beleive in evolution, with God's guidence to get us over
314   the hard spots, like collecting the correct chemicals together for the cells,
315   and God's guidence to show those cells the thrill of reproduction.  I agree
316   with you that with out God, Man could never have happened.  But the theory of
317   evolution doesn't at all exclude God.  By your own arguments (which are rather
318  week and unsubstanciated) evolution needed help, and I think that God gave it
319   the little extra umph, not to mention the original big bang to get things
320   rolling.
321       Anyway, so much for my off the cuff rambling.  If you disagree with me,
322   do me the curtesy of answering one question: how can you prove to me,
323   knowing my beliefs, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that evolution is strictly
324   impossible?  In the process, take my lead, and do not call me names for not
325   believing in your gospel, nor impose your truth upon mine...

332 Monsieur D'Autun - Don't think that just because you're named
333 after a treacherous seventeenth century French diplomat you can
334 spread lies about me.
335 
336 Spreading that ridiculous story about some looney mental health
337 professional is an outrage! It's just like you and McKane to
338 fabricate some innane story then fool people into believing it.
339 
340 I think you ought to be kicked off the system for this.
341 
342 John Silverman - Don't believe the Frenchman. Ask Mohammed. Ask
343 anyone. They'll tell you that he and McKane are scum.
344 
345 OK now...lets get things straightened out.
346 
347 I am not the pervert that they say. My thinking is merely ahead
348 of its time. A hundred years ago masturbation was treated wit
349 the same repulsion that being sexually involved with children
350 does today.
351 
352 Times changed. People became more enlightened. Masturbation
353 became so acceptable that even teachers and the clergy now say
354 it's OK.
355 
356 The next step in this liberalization process will be the 
357 acceptance of adult/child love. The taboo against it is an
358 anachronism from a sexually repressive christian heritage.
359 
360 It is a taboo that is beginning to attract public discussion.
361 Discussion is the first step to change. Within ten years the
362 acceptance of my "perversion" will be as accepted as 
363 masturbation is today.
364 
365 Someday even the dimmer wits at Backwater will come to 
366 appreciate this.
367 
368 FYI - I was impressed that you were such an expert on me. Too
369 bad you got it all wrong.
370 
371 I don't upload to Backwater. I've never been able to get Vidtex
372 to do that. I do my major rough draft on a wordprocessor and 
373 polish my final work as I enter it. I hate Enter On
374 doesn't allow for finishing touches.
375 
376 Since when has electro shock ever been used on neurotics? I 
377 know it's used for severe depression. I've never heard of it
378 being used to modify sexual preference. Where did you get your
379 information?
380 
381 If you're going to play the authority you better stand by your
382 statements.
383 
384 To Everybody - I know you folks don't like me much but I'd like
385 to try to appeal to your sense of justice.
386 
387 There aren't very many rules on Backwater but I think it's 
388 important that the ones we have be enforced. I think we 
389 agree that no one has the right to do anything to destroy 
390 someone elses character.
391 
392 Monsieur D'Autun has written lies about me that 
393 discredits anything I might say. I think you guys ought to set
394 him straight.

404   Took a long time for the wheel to turn to this point again!  It looks like
405 the religious debates have begun once more.  Choose your side!  Sharpen your

410 Andy: I hate to burst your bubble, but getting those chemicals to start sticking
411 together in the right way is not difficult under the conditions the earth was
412 experiencing at the time.  This has been demonstrated.  Also, evolution is a
413 fact.  It has been seen time and time again, and does not always require
414 millions of years.  The instance that comes immediately to mind is the
415 Galapagos Islands.

421 Well, I see that the debate has moved on to religion, not surprising, since
422 that it a component of the AIDS scare, so I'll move aside since I'm not one
423 to debate such issues. Every man to his own poison I always say..
424 But One note to French Toast, yes, you were echoing the very hysterics about
425 AIDS that the popular media has been spewing forth. All emotional hype, and
426 no informational material to provide a base behind the statements given.
427 When I am interested in a subject, I research it a bit before echoing the
428 pronouncments of others. And when those pronouncments are "We're all gonna
429 die because you all have your heads in the sand" I tend to be a bit suspect.
430 That is the standard hysterical reaction to an unknown situation. Thus it
431 becomes even more important to study the situation to find out what really
432 is going on. So, in short, if the shoe fits, wear it.

434 **************************************************************************
435 Piper:   it's great to see you my friend. Ill try my best to stay out of
436 this mess and start writing stories when the board turns again.
437 lurking and laughing,
438 *************************kathyD*********************************************
439 It would be nice if SOMEONE would start writing stories; anything other than
440 this off the wall reflection of Sunday morning television, halla loo ya,and all that.
441 The Center for Disease Control is not very likely to issue a press release
442 stating that AIDS has reached epidemic proportions, that they are totally helpless
443 to do anything about it (at least yet), and that if unchecked could afflict
444 hundreds of thousands (if not millions) within the next 20 years.
445    No, this isn't likely. Whether it happens to be true or not, they're not
446 gonna say (admit?) that, now are they? In other words, can we believe what they say? Or is the
447 public being kept unblissfully ignorant in the hopeof avoiding mass panic.
448    Well, I'll tell you a little story. There was ths dog, a stray, who liked to chase trains. One day he was running
449 after a diesel engine, and he got too close. The frnt wheels caught his wagging tail, and clipped the end off.
450    Well , the dog was furious, and resumed his attack with renewed vengeance, and (again) got a little too clos
451 and the rear wheels cut his head off. The moral is, naturally, don't lose your head over a piece of tail. I for one
452 ain't about to. That is the only (so far) way to combat the spread of AIDS- don't get exposed to it. There is really
453 very little else to be said untill a cure, or vaccine is developed. 
454    As to this being God's way of telling 'us' someting, MOOSE HOCKEY. Religious people have made the same stupid ass
455 ertion about the flood, the plague in Europe, and aything else they can manipulate in order to instill fear into '
456 'non believers. One more 'born again Christian= more bucks in the collection plate. [*=*]

463 To Nelsons:
464 I never meant to try and prove evolution was impossible: my main thrust was to ask someone to come to me and *prove* it.
465 I said it was ludicrous to assume that all life could have evolved by itself. I will agree with the *possibility* that
466 God created us through some sort of change. I still assert that it's impossible for all life on this planet to have
467 evolved by itself.
468 
469 I also agree that some forms of change have taken place. Take the horses for example. But that is a *far* cry from the
470 creation of livng beings in the first place. Heck, we're growing taller as a race because of our better nutrition. Fine,
471 changes can happen. But a billion years won't add feathers to our backs or change fish to elephants. Anyway, back to
472 the basics: someone prove to me, that pure evolution, the creation of all things, happened by accident.
473 
474 And if you can't, atheists like Pen Name need to explain how we got here in our present form.
475 
476 Anyway, I realize it's all rehashed stuff. But I for one am anxious for someone to prove evolution as stated above.
477 I'm not the one putting for the theory as fact, so I don't have to prove it can't be, even though it's so obvious. My
478 arguments don't have to be strong or weak, I'm just waiting for someone to offer a decent one on that lame-brained 
479 theory in the first place.
480 
481 And as far as God causing AIDS, well, natually I took a firm stance to evoke some opinion. My true opinion is that its
482 very possible and why not give it some thought. If there is a God, and since evolution is hardly proveable there must be
483 some infinite force, then why wouldn't he? He said he would in the Bible, he did it often in the Bible, so why do we
484 assume he'd never do it again? 'Cause he's 2000 years older and we're 2000 years wiser?
485 
486 "...Let no man deceive himself. If any among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become foolish that he
487 may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God."
488 
489 So, Nelsons, again, someone prove evolution to me. It's not me theory, so I don't have to disprove it. And I honestly
490 hope my writing style is not such that you would assume I would call you names because you disagree with me. Far from
491 it. I'm searching for information and putting forth questions to spark debate. To each their own, but I enjoy a brisk 
492 conversation. Believing in God and evolution hand in hand is great, and I applaude you. It's the evolution-by-itself 
493 that I can't understand, and I can't understand how it can be put forth as fact all on it's own. And personally, I could
494 care less if the world was made in six days or six million years. It doesn't matter. What does matter is whether you
495 believe God did it in the first place.

499 Well, the Bear didn't know who made him or why. All he knew was that this very
500 large and very angry dragon, with his sword in its chest and a very bloody
501 eye, was in the middle of a leap toward where he crouched. He had just a split
502 second to move. His mind had registered deep within the way the dragon had
503 leaped at him the first time. Now his body would have to do the rest.
504 
505 He drove himself forward as far as his aching legs could propel him. In that
506 instant the dragon was over him, in the air. But its prey was now behind the
507 fearsome mouth and the sharp claws, and was suddenly underneath its stomach.
508 
509 The dragon had overshot its mark, but could do nothing about it. It plummeted
510 toward the ground, exactly over the spot where Bear's lunge had taken him.
511 It landed with a loud thud on the ground, smothering Bear completely.
512 
513 All was silent for a moment. The dragon started to grin in evil delight. He
514 knew the weight of its large body would have crushed the Bear. He was slightly
515 chagrined that he would have to lick up the corpse instead of chew the meaty
516 morsels. But at least the bothersome creature was through pestering him.
517 
518 But its one good eye widened suddenly. Shock seemed to fill the dragon's face,
519 and it's huge body shook. It rolled its head from side to side in silent rage,
520 its mouth gaping open and shut like a door blowing in a quiet breeze. Its eye
521 grew wider, and then began to clos e. A fury of scorching hot air escaped from
522 its mouth, and it began to twist in the throes of death...

528     On the subject of AIDS, it is obviously getting attention.  Take your own
529 attention to the subject for example.  It is also an edeclared epidemic, maybe
530 only be the mass media, but declared just the same.  And it is ancient, even
531 as far as diseases go.  And was not created in a Belgian monestary as a dooms
532 day weapon in the sexual revolution.
533     On the subject of God, if your God does cause pain to human beings, your
534 God is then a sadist.  A sadistic god is a evil god, by most definitions. And
535 about the Bible and it's quotations, the Bible will mean anything it's readers
536 want it to mean.  A religion is something which cannot be proved, and the
537 Bible was the Christian way of making sure Chrisitianity would never be proven
538 in the least bit.  To anyone.
539     On the subject of Evolution, as a student of it who does know what Homo
540 Habilus means, along with three dozen other designations, it is scientifically
541 proven.  Of course, no one is scientific enough to have it proven to them
542 scientifically so, it remains unproven.
543     Once anyone admits any changes will occur in progressive generations, they
544 must admit that more changes will occur with more generations.  And those
545 changes will be different for each creature.  And they must admit the theory
546 of evolution is not stupid or they risk admitting they are.
547     Creationists I have spoken to seem to think there is something about life
548 which is divine in nature.  Their definition of life is diffenerent than an
549 evolutionists definition.  Evolutionists I have spoken to think there is
550 chemical fact in life, and that the structure of atoms determines the
551 chemistry of life, which is a fact.
552 
553     If in the course of the debate, anyone should find themselves bored, they
554 might refer to this.  From the way people are talking, and the way I am
555 writing, this probably wont be read.

573 	fred, you continue to amaze me. If my small messages are considered panic fed
574 by you, I guess there is no further sense in talking to you. Go back and read the messages if you have such ability.
575 Don't just look at the words, READ them. There is a big difference between opening a discussion and starting a panic
576 about one. Oh, but Paul Revere was hysterical too, wasn't he. Forgive me for stepping on thy over-sensitive toes fred.
577 You obviously have a great deal to lose, c'est vrai?
578 
579 	Ah, Frank, you are really slipping now. Different boarder (Grand Dragon Master's), different margin, and different
580 style with use of smaller paragraphs similar to, oh well you know who. But this was always a mixed-up crazy world, 
581 where a single person can create so many diverse personalities, and then have those personalities get in fights with
582 each other. As the world is old so is this technique. Like an honored statesman is gathers respect as time goes by.
583 Very clever Frank, but perhaps you don't give dear FYI their due credit. Would you have suddenly popped on on this
584 system if all he had written was true. Could you get away with a simple, "Ya, FYI is right." How boring if the truth
585 told be the only thing told. I say that FYI managed to get you to re-appear, and in that respect he done good. Strike
586 him down, show your teeth, for you certainly have a full set, but according to that other Frenchman he was right on
587 the mark. Anyway, so good to see you back. One never knows how much they miss someone until they go away.

618 Andy: Just wanted to make a few comments on your evolution arguments.  First,
619       I would like to ask where you got the idea that cells practice sexual
620       reproduction.  Cells are asexual and reproduce by fission.  Therefor,
621       if one cell is created, it does not need another one to "mate" with.
622       Second, as to the rib-cage, it probably evolved due to something called
623       survial of he fittest.  A life form with a rib-cage has a much better
624       chance of surviving that one without.  If an animal is produced with a
625       rib-cage, it has a better chance to survive.  Now, how did this rib-cage
626       come about?  By mutation.  One of the lastest suggestions about the
627       causes of these mutations is that they are caused by solar-radiation
628       effecting the developing life form.  Out of space, sorry folks. :-I Max
