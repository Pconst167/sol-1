21 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
22 	Bard came in sight of the Inn. There was someone standing outside
23 moving in his direction. As he came to the bridge he saw it was Cragmore.
24 	"Greetings, Cragmore. How goes the world?" They chatted on incon-
25 sequential items as they entered the Inn.
26 	After ordering drinks, they sat at a table with Milchar and his 
27 apprentice. Finally, the moment came...
28 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
29 	The Inn Keeper's Song (words & music: Peter S. Beagle)
30 There came three ladies at sundown
31 One was as brown as bread is brown
32 One was black, with a sailor's sway
33 And one was pale as the moon by day
34 
35 The white one wore an emerald ring
36 The brown led a fox on a silver string
37 And the black one carried a rosewood cane
38 With a sword inside, for I saw it plain
39 
40 They took my own room, they barred the door
41 They sang songs I never had heard before
42 My cheese and mutton they did destroy
43 And they called for wine....and the stable boy
44 
45 And once they quarrelled, and twice they cried
46 Their laughter blazed thru the countryside
47 The ceiling shook and the plaster flew
48 And the fox ate my pigeons...all but two
49 
50 They rode away with the morning sun
51 The brown like a queen, the white like a nun
52 And the black one singing with scarlet joy
53 And I'll have to get a new stable boy....
54 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
55 	As the laughter died away, Bard inquired, "Well, what is happening
56 these days?"

85      "Oh Bard, you do have a way with a song." Cragmore said, a smile on his
86 face wider than he had been able to muster in a long time. "Times have been
87 rough at the Inn. Our cozy Inn has been the target of a multitude of dark
88 characters, the kind we have not seen in many years. The kept coming and we
89 kept getting rid of them. There doesn't seem to be an end to their supply. 
90 Many of the old timers that used to frequent this place have sworn it off. They
91 just can't stand the attitude some visitors seem to harbor towards other
92 inngoers, and the Innkeep himself. I'm sorry to say we're about the only
93 ones left, Bard."
94       Milchar nodded his head slowly. "But you never know when they might
95 return. A little house cleaning here and there, a dab of paint and a good
96 song or two might just bring some of them back." Milchar paused, then added,
97 "And there is the door."
98       "What door" Bard inquired.
99       "Over there" Cragmore pointed towards the shadows near the bar. Bard
100 peered into the gloom, and when his eyes adjusted, saw what the others were
101 speaking of.
102        A large metal door at least ten feet high and 6 feet wide stood next
103 to the Inn's bar. It appeared to be solidly constructed, and firmly implanted
104 into the wall. The door's metal exterior glowed very slightly from the fire
105 light in the hearth.
106        "What in tarnation? Where did it come from? I don't remember a room
107 there? Who built it?"
108        "Questions, questions, Bard!" Cragmore said, shaking his head. "We
109 don't know much more than you. It appeared one day. The Innkeeper disclaims
110 all knowledge of it. He says one morning he walked in and there it was. It
111 has no door handle, as you can see, and neither Milchar or I have been able
112 to penetrate it with our special skills. Needless to say, it seems impervious
113 to any forceful entry. And then there's the sound."
114        "Don't tell me you hear sounds from behind the door!" Bard started to
115 laugh.
116        "I'm afraid it's true." Milchar returned. "Go ahead and listen for
117 yourself and tell us what you think."
118        "I'll do just that." Bard pushed back his chair and walked up to the
119 door. Carefully he turned his head and placed his right ear next to the metal
120 door.
121        Cragmore and Milchar could tell by the expression on Bard's face as he
122 returned to the table that he indeed had heard something.
123        Cragmore smiled and said, "So Bard, what did those fine musician's
124 ears hear behind that mysterious door?"
125        Bard paused for a second before answering, as if carefully forming his
126 words prior to responding. "It...sounded...like...construction. That's it!
127 construction. I heard sounds like sawing and pounding of wood. And metal
128 bars clanging together. There wasn't a great deal of activity going on back
129 there, but I do know the sounds of something being built." Bard seemed to
130 smile the smile one gives when he solves someone elses mystery.
131        "That's amazing Bard. You certainly do have good hearing, but your
132 hypothesis does not explain who or the how." Cragmore was not about to let
133 his friend rest on any laurels for too long.
134        "Well, er, I haven't figured out everything yet, but give me time. I
135 might have something in my pack that will shed some more light on the Inn's
136 latest oddity."
137        Cragmore and Milchar looked at each other and shrugged.

146 "Stand back, we are the police,"
147 Lipton was restrained by the powerful arms of two soldiers. His every tug
148 against them shook the rifles strapped to their shoulders. His flat was
149 ransacked. Searched from carpet to light bulb. Then the police force left him
150 on his floor. In a crumple. He cried from trauma as he dialed out on the
151 telephone.
152  
153 "I am listening,"
154 It was a darkly Slavic voice, and an ominous Slavic phrase of regards. Dimitri
155 was a friend though. Large and with a deep voice. The sort of voice that
156 warmed you to him, even if he was scolding you as a student in class.
157  
158 As head master and a professor at the University, he met Lipton during the
159 previous Winter. At a local seminar on tree fungi and the insects that ate at
160 them. Since then, they had been close companions. Even presenting gifts of
161 books from their opposing nations.
162  
163 "Dimitri, the police were here. They tore the place apart. They stole several
164 of my sketches. A months work and several of the subjects are migrating away
165 even now."
166  
167 Lipton was nearly screaming. His head was in a spin. His fever was rising and
168 his pressing cold could only have been worsened. After a short pause, he asked
169 a simple question.
170 "What should I do?"
171  
172 "Listen, friend. We can get the sketches back for you. The Minister of
173 Learning and I often get materials confiscated at the border from tourists or
174 students. We can get your work back. As for the police, why are they after
175 you, are you a spy?"
176 Laughter erupted from the earpiece.
177  
178 "No, Dimitri. If they think that, wont they put me in prison?"
179 "Don't worry. I know you are not a spy, and I can pull strings. As you say.
180 Now come over here and have a dinner with me. We can talk about the sketches
181 and how I can identify them,"
182  
183 "Thank you, I'll be over soon. I have some cleaning to do. Soon then,"

238     Anyone interested in a Play-by-Mail of Avalon Hills board game 
239 Squad Leader? I have a system that I recevied from a veteran player.
240 The system works with both the basic Squad Leader and the first gammette
241 Cross of Iron. I am a novice player currently knowledgeable of rules
242 through section three. If you are interested please leave a message with
243 you address (private if you wish) and I will send you a copy of the
244 system. You may also include any scenario preferences you have (1-3).

248      The nightmarecame on the night of Tobias's fifteenth birthday, the day
249 his parents informed him of his adoption.  In the dream there were monsters.
250 Monsterds
251          of all different shapes and sizes and powers. Some had horns, some had
252 claws, some had hair while others did not, but they all had two things in common
253 : their love of killing and bloodshed and their love of the taste of blood.
254 They ran around with huge goblets filled with blood, to them it was like a 
255 heady wine...
256 
257     Tobias screamed himself awake, sweat soaked and shaking.  His mother and
258 father rushed in.
259     " are you ok" his mother asked with concern.
260     " ye..yeah, go back to bed mom.I'm fine."
261     He sat there pondering his dream. Slow realization hit him.  Maybe he 
262 was crazy.  It was only a dream.  The creatures told him he wasn't human. 
263 His tight lip of concern gradually turned into a smirk of evil..
264 
265     The dream came every night since then. The demons tell him of powers that
266 he possesses that grow stronger as he grows older. They tell him of his destiny
267 and his purpose. Tobias no longer screams at nighttime, he welcomes it with
268 pleasure............

349 	"No, that's not it.... I *know* it's in here *somewhere*..." Bard 
350 could be heard mumbling to himself as he rummaged through his pack. While
351 the others at the table were ignoring him while searched, a few people at
352 other tables were staring.
353 	His pack was only about 18 inches deep...so how could he be in it
354 halfway to his waist? Old-timers were used to this sort of thing, but there
355 were always a few newcomers.
356 	"AHA! Got it!" exclaimed Bard. He set a strange box on the table
357 without withdrawing his head from the pack. He rumaged for another minute
358 or so, placing some odd looking objects with wires attached next to it.
359 	The box was about an inch & a half tall, a foot wide, and 8 inches
360 deep. the bottom half was black while the top was a sort of off-white. 
361 a third of the top was taken up by a grayish-black panel, while most of the
362 rest was covered with numerous 1/2 inch square blocks and a few rectangular
363 ones. They had some sort or runes on top.
364 	He  withdrew his head from the pack and proceeded to attach the
365 wires from the objects to the box. He then started pressing the blocks in 
366 some sort of pattern. Apparently they were movable with a limited amount of
367 vertical travel.
368 	He pointed various of the objects at the metal panel in the wall.
369 While doing so he stared intenly at the gray panel on the box. What he saw
370 appeared to puzzle him. He pressed the blocks again while muttering to
371 himself.
372 	"Multi-spectral.... neutrino flux.....graviic anomaly....magnetic
373 flux..." Most of the words meant nothing to the others. Finally he just
374 sat and stared at the box....

464 "Sokorsky! Why did you search the flat of a foreign scientist named Lipton?"
465  
466 The Chairman was fuming with anger. Dimitri had incited this anger at a dinner
467 he was invited to. Describing with elegant detail the persecution of a foreign
468 scientist. I understand his fiction of the broken glasses on the Persian rug
469 was enough that the Chairman struck the dining table in anger.
470  
471 "Sir, he spies on the manoeuvres! Let me prove it,"
472 over to him. The specimens in those pictures are long dead, and not due again
473 until January,"
474  
475 "Sir,"
476 "At the earliest! You will not prevent this scientist from his observations,
477 do you understand?"
478  
479 Sokorsky stood up. His briefcase hanging in both his hands, in front of him.
480 He left the room in a silence. Though he was not silent for long. From a
481 telephone at the lobby desk of the Secretariat building, he ordered the arrest
482 of Lipton. For charges of espionage.

511 Looks like ALL ALLOWED is becoming a thing of the past...
512      To the twits: Why do you insist on pulling such childish and destructive
513 pranks? There are dozens of systems in the Portland Metro area that you would
514 have much more fun desecrating. I mean, jeez, where's the excitment in 
515 attacking a system like Backwater? There's nothing to crack, nothing to steal,\
516 no challenges at all, even to the twit neophyte! We don't ask for much, we 
517 simply find The Waters to be a great place to share our writings, in a nice,
518 free-form envirenment... You are welcome to join us if you will grow up a 
519 little, I'd love to hear some real writing from you fellows, something besides
520 twisting someone else's efforts...
