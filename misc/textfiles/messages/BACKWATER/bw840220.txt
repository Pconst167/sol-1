30 Evan:	From your comments, you seem to be more of an agnostic than an
31 atheist. An atheist is SURE that there is no God. An agnostic is waiting for
32 all the evidence to come in.

88 && IDICIDICIDICIDICIDIC &&
89 I'd rather talk about religion here. I've spent too many years in school
90 already.
91 You need something interesting to talk about? How about this:
92 Two thousand years ago a dead man got up and lived again. And he said that
93 WE CAN DO IT TOO!
94 (I'm not a preacher, just trying to get the juices flowing again before
95 this BBS has to be raised from the dead.)
96               && The Mad Actor &&
97 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
98 The piper sat forward in his seat listening to the desultory conversations
99 going on around him.  Why not?
100 
101    Hey now, all you Christians and Athiests (and any other religions that 
102 would like to mix it up) -- the Christians asked a good question:
103   "What if the story of Christ is true?"
104 --and for you Christians:
105   "What if it is a hoax?"
106 
107 AND -- for other religious viewpoints (conspicious by their absence -- we 
108 seem really to have Christians+ and Christians- ) what about your fundamental
109 belief -- what if it is wrong?
110 
111 The piper drank another glass of ale, not expecting much to come of the comment
112 he had put out.  He turned to the bard.
113 "I hope you will forgive my poor attempt at rhyme, it is not my own but was
114 was probably written in the early 1600's by a poet named Robert Herrick.  A
115 young lady seems to be seeking moral support for her sexual activities.  I 
116 cannot, of course, condone such -- but she may derive comfort from this verse.

119 
120 Gather ye rosebuds while ye may;
121   Old Time is still a-flying;

123   Tomorrow will be dying.

125 The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
126   The higher he's a-getting,
127 The sooner will his race be run,
128   And nearer he's to setting.
129 
130 The age is best which is the first,
131   When youth and blood are warmer;
132 But being spent, the worse and worst
133   Times still succeed the former.
134 
135 Then be not coy, but use your time,
136   And while ye may, go marry;
137 For having lost but once your prime,
138   You may forever tarry.
139 
140 Feeling very old for his age, the piper sat down and reached an unsteady hand
141 for another mug of ale.
142 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
143 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
144 Piper: Good point on the above, I tend to look at it like this: if
145 I'm wrong, I'm just wasting my time, but that mean in the long run
146 it dosent matter anyway. If I'm right, I know I'm ready for whatever may 
147 occur. What if the ones on the other side are wrong?
148             Bo
149 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
150 Piper:	An interesting question, I at one time agreed with Bo. "If I'm wrong
151 all I've wasted is time, if I'm right then I've saved my 'immortal soul'".
152 Unfortunately, about that time they started discussing a related point in
153 religion class (I was attending a parochial school). It seems that (according to
154 Catholic doctrines derived, I believe, from Thomas Aquinas) that belief must be 
155 'sincere'. In other words, you must 'do the right thing' because it is right -
156 not because you are afraid of what will happen if you don't.
157 	Now this does seem fairly logical and reasonable, but some of the
158 implications bothered me. (they still do!) How can I be SURE that I am
159 (for example) following the commandments because they are the word of God. 					
160 Maybe at the back of my mind I'm just scared of going to hell. If so, well
161 too bad! Go directly to hell, do not pass heaven, do not gain eternal salvation.
162 	It was about this time I started having my doubts about organized religion.....

168       he turned to face toward the speaker. So no one feels they
169       are interested in 'intellectual property'! So much for that.
170       If it's religion the patrons are obsessed with perhaps a
171       story I picked up at one of the conventions on the functions
172       of a complex variable would be worth the telling...
173   
174    It seems that Begin was visiting the white house. He noticed
175    that the president had three phones on his desk, a red phone
176    a white phone and a blue phone.
177  
178    "What are the three phones for?", Begin asked.
179   
180    "The RED phone is so I can keep in constant touch with Moscow,
181     in case a world crisis arises and we need to communicate quickly.
182     The BLUE phone is so I can talk to the secretary of state on a
183     moments notice, for the same reasons.
184     The WHITE phone is a line to heaven."
185   
186    "Would you mind if I used the white phone myself?", Begin asked.
187    The president indicated that it was o.k. so he picked up the
188    phone and talked for a few minutes. After he finished he said,
189    "I'd like to pay you for the charges. How much are they?"
190   
191    The president looked at a meter on the phone and said, "$9883.00".
192  
193    Well Begin paid and left. To make a long story short he was for
194    some reason visiting the Vatican a few months later and noticed
195    That the Pope had red and white and blue phones. On inquiring
196    he discovered the white one was a line to heaven and he obtained
197    permission to use it. Afterward he inquired as to the cost.
198   
199    The Pope said, "twenty five cents."
200   
201    "Why that's incredible!", remarked Begin, "I used the one in the
202     white house for less than a tenth of the time and it was nearly
203     nine thousand dollars. Why such a difference?"
204   
205    "It's a local call from here.", answered the Pope.

211 General Macaibo:
212 
213 Sorry it took me so long to get back to you about your moon 
214 base but I got off on a tangent.
215 
216 You said you were planning to raise $50-100 million from a 
217 computer company you were starting to finance the mining 
218 project. I was wondering why, if you had the business acumen 
219 to accumulate so much money, are you switching to a non-profit 
220 corporation for the mining station?
221 
222 And why are you giving away the ore that you are mining? 
223 Wouldn't it be better to run the thing for a profit?
224 
225 Another thing I don't understand is why you're using 
226 volunteers. For something this important wouldn't it be 
227 better to pay for the best? You need top quality technical 
228 help and I doubt you'll get if for free.
229 
230 I noticed you appear to be focusing your attention on the 
231 technical aspects of the project. Are you overlooking the 
232 human factors?
233 
234 What kind of people will you use. What qualifications must 
235 they have? What qualities do you want in your top managers? 
236 In your workers? How will you get good people if you don't 
237 plan to pay them? What will be their motivation? 
238 
239 Other than your $100 million start up money how are you going 
240 to finance the venture? Who will contribute and what will 
241 they expect in return? If you go for corporate or government 
242 financing how are you going to control the power brokers?
243 
244 I imagine you've probably already thought all this stuff 
245 through but I'm not certain that I see how your going to 
246 pull it off. It occurs to me that there are some significant 
247 obsticles you haven't addressed yet. I'll be interested in 
248 hearing how you intend to overcome them.

373 The piper quickly lifted his arm and the pervasive drone disappeared almost
374 with an audible click.  He turned to the patrons who seemed most interested
375 in discussing religious matters and asked:
376 "Are there no other options?  Leonard -- and anyone else -- why do people in
377 our culture persist in binary religious thinking?  From the arguments that 
378 have raged on this system in times past, one would think that either
379 Christianity is literally true, with the bible being totally without any error,
380 and totally unquestionable,
381 or nothing else exists at all.  I submit that these two veiwpoints are extremely
382 arrogant and do not take into account the vast majority of the population of
383 our planet.  What if you are both totally wrong, the athiest "dammed to hell"
384 for unbelief, the Christian for following false gods (yes gods -- true 
385 monotheism does not allow a troika as godhead.  One boss, no father, son, etc.)
386 O.K., I guess I' should get more specific-- what if Kouhmini is right?  (He
387 hasn't been in the news in so long that I'm not sure of the spelling!)"

389 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
390 PIPER: ONE OF MY PIPER FRIENDS IS CONTENT TO AMUSE HIMSELF AT HOME, THE
391 OTHER HAS HER OWN BAND, WITH FIVE PIPERS AND TWO DRUMMERS.
392 AS TO WHETHER CHRIST OR THE BIBLE IS REAL A LOOK INTO HISTORY PROVES
393 UNDENIABLY THAT HE WAS A REAL PERSON. (not God in the flesh) NEARLY
394 EVERYONE TODAY HAS HEARD OF JESUS CHRIST. HIS INFLUENCE ON HISTORY HAS
395 BEEN GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER HUMAN. INDEED THE VERY CALENDAR USED
396 IN MOST PARTS OF THE EARTH IS BASED ON THE YEAR HE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE
397 BEEN BORN. AS THE WORLD BOOK ENCYCLOPEDIA SAYS: "DATES BEFORE THAT
398 YEAR ARE LISTED AS B.C., OR BEFORE CHRIST. DATES AFTER THAT YEAR ARE
399 LISTED AS A.D., OR ANNO DIMINI(in the year of our Lord). ALSO NOTES
400 THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNIA, "IN ANCIENT TIMES EVEN THE OPPONENTS OF
401 CHRISTIANITY NEVER DOUBTED THE ACTUAL EXISTENCE OF JESUS". IF YOU
402 WOULD LIKE MORE INFO ON PROOF, JUST ASK.
403 
404 HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE, ON AGNOSTICS. IF YOU ARE AN 
405 AGNOSTIC, YOU COME SOMEWHERE BETWEEN AN ATHIEST AND A THIEST. THE
406 ATHIEST IS CONVINCED THAT GOD DOES  NOT EXIST, WHILE THE THIEST 
407 HAS A FIRM BELIEF THAT GOD DOES EXIST AND THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN
408 HUMAN AFFAIRS.
409 THE AGNOSTIC DOES NOT FEEL THAT THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SAY 
410 THAT GOD DOES OR DOES NOT EXIST. RATHER, HE (or she) RESERVES JUDGEMEMT
411 OR SAYS THAT IF GOD DOES EXIST HE IS UNKNOWN OR UNKNOWABLE. THIS IS
412 THE WAY I USED TO BELIEVE.
413 THE TERM "AGNOSTIC",(Greek-agnostos,"unknown") WAS COINED BY THE
414 19TH CENTURY BRITISH SCIENTIST THOMAS H. HUXLEY, WHO ALSO HELPED TO
415 POPULARIZE THE DARWINIAN THEORY OF EVOLUTION. HUXLEY NOTED THAT THE 
416 CHURCHES CLAIMED TO HAVE A SPECIAL (gnosis) KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GOD AND
417 THE ORIGIN OF THINGS. HE GAVE ONE REASON WHY HE COULD NOT ACCEPT THIS,
418 AND HENCE WAS AGNOSTIC: "IF WE COULD ONLY SEE IN ONE VIEW, THE TORRENTS
419 OF HYPOCRISY AND CRUELTY, THE LIES, SLAUGHTER, THE VIOLATIONS OF EVERY
420 OBLIGATION OF HUMANITY, WHICH HAVE FLOWED FROM THIS SOURCE [THE 
421 CHURCHES] ALONG THE COURSE OF HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN NATIONS, OUR
422 WORST IMAGINATIONS OF HELL WOULD PALE BESIDE THE VISION."
423 DOUBTLESS HIS FAITH HAD BEEN SHAKEN BY THE CONDUCT BY THOSE WHO SHOULD
424 HAVE BEEN HELPING AND NOT DESTROYING.
425 SOCIALIST HAROLD LASKI, WROTE IN A SIMILAR VEIN,"I WAS BROUGHT UP IN 
426 AN ORTHODOX JEWISH FAMILY; BUT I CANNOT EVEN REMEMBER A PERIOD IN 
427 WHICH EITHER RITUAL OR DOGMA HAD MEANING FOR ME. BOTH IN ENGLAND
428 AND AMERICA I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SEE IN ANY OF THE ORGANIZED
429 CHURCHES A FAITH IN IT'S PRINCIPLES SUFFICIENT TO MAKE IT DO 
430 SERIOUS BATTLE FOR JUSTICE. I CANNOT SEE IN THE HISTORIC PROCESS,
431 THAT THE CHURCHES HAVE HAVE BEEN OTHER THAN THE ENEMIES OF REASON
432 IN THOUGHT AND OF JUSTICE IN SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS."
433 HERE, HERE, I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER, HAROLD!
434 BUT HAS THE CONDUCT OF THE CHURCHES CAUSED YOU, TOO, TO DOUBT
435 THE EXISTANCE OF GOD? IT IS TRUE THEIR HYPOCRISY AND WRONG CON-
436 DUCT ARE A MATTER OF HISTORY. NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BIBLE, THE
437 FOREMOST SOURCE OGF INFORMATION ABOUT GOD, FORETOLD THE RISE OF
438 JUST SUCH A PERVERSION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH:"THEY WILL PRE-
439 SERVE ALL THE OUTWARD FORM OF RELIGION, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE LONG 
440 BEEN STRANGERS TO ITS MEANING."2 TIMOTHY 3:5, KNOX.
441 IN FACT, THE SHORT COMINGS OF ESTABLISHED RELIGIONS ARE NO REASON
442 TO CONCLUDE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST. IF A SICK PERSON HAS BEEN 
443 CHEATED BY A QUACK DOCTOR, HE SHOULD NOT THUS CONCLUDE THAT NO CURE
444 IS POSSIBLE. RATHER HE SHOULD LOOK AROUND FOR A GENUINE DOCTOR.
445 SIMILIARLY, THE FACT THAT THE ESTABLISHED CHURCHES HAVE TURNED 
446 PEOPLE AWAY FROM GOD DOES NOT MEAN THAT GOD CANNOT BE FOUND. IT
447 MERELY MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE.
448 THE RESEARCHES OF OXFORD UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR E.A. MILNE
449 STRONGLY CONVINCED HIM THAT GOD EXISTS.MODERN SCIENCE SHOWS WITH
450 INCREASING CLARITY THE COMPLEXITY AND BEAUTY OF THE LAWS GOVERNING
451 THE UNIVERSE. MILNE FELT THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE EXISTANCE OF
452 GOD TO EXPLAIN BOTH WHERE MATTER CAME FROM AND WHO ORIGINATED THE
453 LAWS OF NATURE THAT CONTROL THE MATTER. "IF THERE IS A MYSTERY
454 ABOUT THE CREATION MATTER," HE MAINTAINED,"THERE WOULD BE A STILL
455 GREATER MYSTERY ABOUT THE CREATION OF ARBITRARY LAWS TO GOVERN IT."
456 HENCE HE CONCLUDE," THOUGH I HAVE HAD MY PERIODS OF AGNOSTICISM, I
457 HAVE ALWAYS RECOVERED FROM THEM. I DO FERVENTLY BELIEVE THAT THIS
458 UNIVERSE WAS CREATED BY ALMIGHTY GOD." THAT'S HIS OPINION ANYWAY.
459 I THOUGHT IT INTERESTING.
460 LEONARD: I SEE THE DILIMA, BUT THE HELLFIRE AND BRIMSTONE DOCTRINE
461 PROPOUNDED BY MANY A CHURCH IS MERELY A PLOY TO CONTROL THEIR FOL-
462 LOWERS WITH FEAR. A CREATOR OF SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AS OUR UNIVERSE
463 WOULD NOT NEED TO STOOP TO SUCH A LEVEL. THE BIBLE DOES NOT SUPPORT
464 ETERNAL TORMENT. BESIDES IF THIS PLACE REALLY EXISTED, MAN HAS DONE
465 ENOUGH DIGGING AND EXCAVATING THAT SURELY HE WOULD HAVE RUN INTO IT.
466 THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT THE DEAD ARE DEAD. DEATH IS THE OPPOSITE OF 
467 LIFE. JESUS MANY TIMES, COMPARED IT TO SLEEP. AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN
468 THE BIBILE SAYS THE DEAD ARE UNCONSCIOUS, UNTHINKING. SEE ECCLESIASTES
469 9:5,10.....PSALMS 146:4.....ECCLESIASTES 3:19,20. ALSO THE BIBLE
470 SAYS THAT JESUS WAS IN HELL FOR THREE DAYS. ACTS 2:27, 31.
471 MY, MY TIME HAS GOTTEN AWAY FROM ME. I'VE USED UP TWO OR THREE
472 DAYS OF MY ALOTTED TIME! PLEASE FORGIVE!
473 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
474 The Poet smiled and clapped his hands as he approached the man with the 
475 pipes.
476 "Bravo! Sir, that was the finest piebroch I have heard in many a long
477 day. Such a skillful performance deserves reward. You must be thirsty 
478 after your efforts; my friends and I would be honored if you would allow 
479 us to buy you a drink at our table."
480 So saying, he laid one hand on the Piper's arm and gently but irresistably
481 guided him towards the tablewhere sat Graymalken and Lynn.

489   ...Evan, mathematicians don't mean anything by anything. (Just
490      like with frogs, to quote another story.) You can read
491      Mesolithic as 'stone age' if you wish. Or as a transitional
492      state therein. One doesn't wish to be lumped in with some
493      of the modern versions of mathematician who are merely number

496   ...The Mad Actor, the erase screen thing is a mystery to me, and

499      any control characters or funnynesses in it that I can see.
500      I regret the inconvenience to you but suspect that it is not of
501      my doing. I do use the opening and closing brace characters
502      as opening and closing delimiters. Could this be it?? What
503      character(s) would erase your screen?

545 Deborah, I believe YOU think there is
546 a God.  But most of your information was
547 taken from people or articles that are
548 pushing the believe of God. (i.e. the Bible)
549 
550 If there really is a God how did he create
551 the universe?  Scientists have theories that
552 will stand up to the Bible any day of the
553 week including Sunday.
554 
555 I don't really think that somebody could
556 be so stupid as to create a world so
557 totally screwed.
558 
559 This GOD must really have fun watching people
560 suffer!

575 Dear Sysop Mikey;
576 I was busily removing some rather childish revisions made to your sign-on
577 message when I noticed your mention that no restrictions are made to the
578 use of this system. I feel compelled to apologise for my thoughtless
579 censorship; on further reflection I have decided that the individual who
580 goes by the name of "Wrench" has as much right to self-expression (however
581 infantile & childish I may find it) as anyone else. In the future I will
582 not do as I have done.
583 Wrench: I apologise to you also. You have as much right to state your
584 opinions as anyone else. The fact that your chosen vocabulary bothers me
585 only serves to show me up as intolerant.Please don't disturb this message,
586 so that my apology will be known to all. I would like to ask you to extend
587 this same courtesy to the other users of this system, & to use the blank
588 part of the file for your entries in the future. I shall not touch your
589 statements, nor (I hope) will they.
590            Mea Culpa,
591                  && The Mad Actor &&
592 P.S. to The MesoMath:
593 Yep, those brackets are the culprits, all right! My system uses character
594 code 125 for the clear screen instruction. This is the ASCII code for your
595 brackets.

597 HELLO ALL OF YOU PHREAKERS OUT THERE. THIS IS THE STAINLESS
598 STEEL WORM HERE. I THINK THAT YOUR DISCUSION OF RELIGION
599 IS VERY INTERESTING, ALTHOUGH A BIT LONG WINDED IN PARTS.
600 IS THIS BBS EVER USED TO PASS INFO. IF SO, I COULD USE SOME
601 NUMBERS OF SOME MORE PRIVATE BOARDS LIKE THIS WHERE THEY ALLOW
602 AN INTERESTING VARIETY OF LANGUAGE AND INFO TO BE USED.
603 THANX...

610 OK, KIDDIES, WE'S GOT SOME GOOD NEWS, AND SOME BAD NEWS.  FIRST TO GARY:
611 SORRY I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE SYSTEM IN A WEEK OR SO, SO I JUST SAW YOUR ABOVE
612 MESSAGE.  YES, MANY THINGS REMAIN TO BE WORKED OUT, BUT FROM MY EXPERIENCE
613 THEY ARE MINOR.  I AM INVESTINTG THE $100 MILLION IN HUMANITY.  PURE AND
614 SIMPLE.  THERE ARE STILL A FEW OF US OUT HERE.  IF I'LL BLOW THE BUCKS ON
615 THE PROJECT, YOU CAN BET THERE'LL BE TRUCKLOADS OF THE BEST PEOPLE WILLING
616 TO DEVOTE TIME AND ENERGY TO IT.  AND NOT ALL WILL BE UNPAID.  SORRY I CAN'T
617 EXPLAIN MUCH FURTHER, BUT EVEN TRYING TO MAKE A PROFIT, THE VENTURE WILL
618 BE VERRY, VERRRY LUCKY TO BREAK EVEN.  THUS THE NON-PROFIT STATUS. AT
619 LEAST WE WON'T PAY TAXES ON THE LITTLE WE DO GET.
620 
621 SECONDLY, I'M SORRY I GOT WAYLAYED BEFORE I GOT TO FINISH THE STORY ABOUT
622 TIME TRAVEL.  ANYONE WANTS TO FINISH IT, DROP ME A MESSAGE SOMETIME.
623 
624 NOT FOR THE BAD NEWS.  I'VE BEEN GONE BECAUSE I HAVE JUST RAISED 2.5 MILLION
625 DOLLARS TO BEGIN THE COMPUTER COMPANY WE WERE DISCUSSING, BUT HAVE TO MOVE
626 TO SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA TO COLLECT.  SIGH.  SO I WON'T BE BACK ON THE
627 SYSTEM REGULARLY.  I WILL TRY TO LOG IN LONG DISTANCE ON SATURDAY NIGHTS,
628 HOWEVER, SO PLEASE DROP ME A LINE.
629 BYE BYE FROM DAVER, GENERAL MACAIBO, CONTREMON VALERIUS, AND GOOD OL SPIKE!
