75 Mr. Innkeeper, I am sure you will enjoy your new model. As you have noticed,
76 there are a few new modifications. Some have expressed displeasure with our
77 modifying an age old model, but as always, progress dictates we keep up with
78 advancing technology. Your old steed will never know what hit him. His end
79 will come painlessly. Please don't let it concern you. We have a lot of
80 compassion for these beasts before we turn them into glue. Good bye, good
81 luck, and thank you for your business. I hope we can help you some more in
82 the future, be it 5 years or 50000 miles, whichever comes first.

88 I'll tell you about it later. How do you like your orchestra 90? I did not

93 Quizmaster:In my next communique I will have a few of my own little quizzes.
94 I hope they fare better then the Trek quotes that Aaron failed so miserably
95 on.
96 Aaron: Are you listening? Do the agents from the Hacker HITline drive big
97 dark sedans, wear grey pinstripe suits, dark glasses, and walkie-talkies?
98 If so, they are getting close, of not, I think I am still in trouble!
99 Milchar: I too have a "Boy George Begone" card in the database. Shall we
100 chant together?
101 Mikey:Customer #1 still out of town, will keep trying...
102 voyeur: Are you sure?
103 Ninja: What is the yield of your weapons. I want to know so I can be out of

109 Milchar, we're going to have to stop meeting like this; people are beginning
110 to talk.
111 Regarding the groupie question: wattsa matter, 'fraid I cheated?
112 I sat down, thought very hard, called my uncle Harry, and Voila!
113 Hey, no, actually, I did it the old fashioned way. (the other old fashioned way).
114 All the characters in the first group are formed with only straight lines.
115 All the characters in the third group are formed with only curved lines
116 The second group gets what's left--like Ninjas "J", which has a straight
117 shaft but a curved base. (I was going to say 'bottom' but some of our
118 viewers have a puerile sense of humor.)
119 I grouped the letters according to the way I learned to print them; the
120 character generator on my computer learned to form a "C" with a straight
121 back, and an "O" with straight sides, for example.
122 No takers on my last puzzle?  I'm not surprised.  If 'I' can't solve it, it is of course too much to expect gerbils, mice,
123 hawthornes, phoenixes, 'frogs' and other such rejects to even understand
124 the question.  {did that come out of me?  a really great way to alienate
125 the paying customers.  must be from watching those lizards on the boob
126 this evening}.
127 Speaking of V, what a dumb ending.  This kid grows to the size and maturity of
128 a nine-year old; saves the world with some unexplained power (and the scene reminded
129 me all too much of the ending of the first Star Trek movie), the
130 chief baddie (Diana) escapes from the ship, and we last see her sitting in space eyeing Earth with an evil
131 smirk a la Darth Vader at the end of Star Wars.  The aliens are killed off by H.G. Well's War of
132 the Worlds gimmick.  The rebels, in isolated groups, have the ability
133 to incubate and process the germs in quantities enough to dose the entire world.

162   LET MY SPEAK IN MY OWN DEFENSE
163 OR QUESTION AS IT WERE.WHY DOES
164 NO ONE HERE LIKE OR EVEN TOLERA-
165 TE ME?I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO FIT
166 IN WITH THE "DESIRABLES" AS MIL-
167 CHAR WOULD PUT IT.AND YET ALL I
168 RECEIVE IN TURN IS ACCUSATIONS
169 OF GENETIC MIS-STRUCTURING,AND
170 A NEAT LITTLE SWEEP INTO A FAR
171 OFF CORNER.
172   I AM NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE
173 BOY GEORGERS,THE PHOENIX,THE
174 PHANTOM WRITER,OR ANYONE WITH
175 SUCH INCLINATIONS.AND YET I HAVE
176 BEEN TOLD THAT I AM.
177   WHEN I FOUND THIS SYSTEM I
178 THOUGHT SOMETHING AKIN TO "OH

180 IN,A PLACE WHERE FREINDS COULD
181 BE..."NO!WHAT DO I GET FOR WHAT
182 I CONSIDER PROPER ETTIQUETTE,

188 LET POSSIBLY FIVE PEOPLE DO IN
189 MY LIFE.YOU HURT ME.
190   YES I WAS PRESUMING TOO MUCH,
191 BUT AT LEAST COMMON COURTESY WAS
192 EXPECTABLE.MAYBE NOT.
193   WELL NOW I AM DONE BEING INSU-
194 LTED.AND DONE BEING HURT.I WONT
195 CONSIDER PEOPLE FREINDS AGAIN.I
196 WONT BE HURT BY YOU AGAIN,I WONT
197 LET ANYONE CLOSE.
198   MY INSTINCT IS TO STRIKE BACK
199 AND DECIMATE BLACKWATER,AND FIN-
200 ALLY PAY YOU BACK FOR WHAT YOU
201 DID TO ME.AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE MY
202 NICITIES WILL WEAR OFF,SO WATCH
203 OUT FOR HAWTHORNE.NO FANCIFUL
204 TITLES JUST HAWTHORNE.MY REAL
205 NAME IN CASE ANYONE BESIDES AAR-
206 ON IS WONDERING.
207   CISOP MIKEY:I AM SORRY FOR MA-
208 KING SUCH A LONG STATEMENT,AND I
209 AM SORRY FOR THREAENING BLACKWA-

218 ********************************************************************************
219 Dropped bit:Are you interested in USING (not buying) my microfilming stuff?
220 
221 Quizmaster: I haven't seen "V: the final battle" yet, because I work nights. 
222 I hope to watch the tape this weekend. So please forgive any inaccuracies.
223 Germ warfare is EASY, you could breed a plague that would devaste Portland in 
224 your kitchen. The main reason terrorists haven't tried it is that, while 
225 breeding large cultures is easy, immunizing yourself isn't. In V I doubt that
226 this will be a problem! A *SINGLE* test tube can contain enough of many bio-war
227 agents to kill EVERYONE in the US (probably the world!). The problem is 
228 distributing the agent in a reasonably even pattern.
229 ___________________________________Leonard______________________________________
230 && && &&
231 No story line now, I don't know how it comes out yet.
232 Hawthorne: Please don't be angry with us all; the people who are insulting/rejecting you are for the most part thee
233 same ones who we "regulars" (I actually consider us "Premium No-leads") are having problems coping with. Other
234 than a slight tendency toward incoherent names, I have no fleebles with your messages. Actually, I think you fit in
235 rather well with the menagerie assembled here. The problem as I see it is that I didn't attend the last PC&S
236 gathering. These poor children around here are just lost for a good storyline without my input, and nothing
237 serves to bring the BakH2O together like a good tag-team tale. Political & religious discussion comes a distant
238 second. (Don't get me wrong, I like that too.) So, everybody out there, let's get another story going. I can't 
239 supply ALL the ideas ( I'm SOOO humble) so I'm soliciting suggestions. With the creative talent out there this 
240 dillemma should be solved in no time at all. (No time at all...nice concept.)
241 By the way, I favor the 120-char. margin for 2 reasons: 1) it makes more efficient use of scarce disk space, and
242 2) since I have to put up with choppy lines on my 38-col screen anyway I think that EVERYONE should suffer too. I'd
243 use 128, but I hear it gives fits to some terminal software.
244                && The Mad Actor && 
245 *************************************************************
246 Hawthorne: One of the first things many of us learned when we 
247 started on this system is that sometimes you need a thick skin.
248 Don't let a few discouraging comments get you down; I'm afraid 
249 that's just the price we sometimes pay for the good times
250 Backwater can offer. Hang in there, there's a place for 
251 everyone in this madhouse. You belong here as much as the 
252 rest of us. Gary 
253 :***********************************************************:
254 Mad Actor: I've felt that adventures are more fun if they're 
255 not pre-planned by a group of insiders. That's primarily the 
256 reason the McKane organization has never had a representative
257 at any of the Backwater functions. I feel it's more fun (as 
258 well as more spontaneous and creative) if the participants
259 don't have any idea what's going to happen. That's only my 
260 opinion, of course, and it comes from someone who has never
261 appreciated the joys of belonging to a clique. Grand D.
262 ===================
263 P.S. - One last opinion. Mohammed Wassir (Mike Bigham) is 
264 certainly among the most creative talents I've seen on this 
265 board. Since Mohammed hasn't made an appearance in recent 
266 adventures I feel that they have suffered as a consequence. 
267 I, for one, miss the imagination that brought us Mohammed, 
268 Valinor, and Serena. They were able to keep the action going 
269 without first needing to confer with the group. GDM

339 POSSIBLE IN THE FACE OF A CRISIS THAT SOME OF THE MISTAKES
340 WROUGHT IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN (ILL) HAVE CORRECTED THEMSELVES
341 IN SOME SORT OF ON-LINE REGENERATION. RECENT MESSAGES HAVE

343 INANE BANAL MESSAGES FROM BEFORE. ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL ROOM
344 FOR IMPROVEMENT, WE ARE WILLING TO WAIT AND SEE, AND HOPE FOR
345 THE BEST. OUR DECISION WAS IN NO WAY MADE IN ACCORDANCE TO
346 THE MANY BLEEDING HEARTS WHO CAME TO THE AID OF HAWTHORNE. BUT
347 THE FACT THAT SOME SEEMED TO THINK HIS CONTINUED EXISTANCE
348 WAS WARRENTED (ALTHOUGH UTTERLY BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION), WE
349 SET ABOUT TRYING TO WORK OUT A WAY TO SEE THIS EXPERIMENT
350 THROUGH. COMPARE THIS SITUATION WITH A NEW TELEVISION SITCOM
351 THAT IS GIVEN FOUR MORE WEEKS TO FIND AN AUDIENCE. HAWTHORNE,
352 FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, DO NOT WASTE THIS TIME. IF YOU CONTINUE TO
353 IMPROVE, YOUR EXISTANCE WILL BE CARRIED OVER INTO NEXT SEASON.
354 HOWEVER-THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON THE HORRIBLE FAILURE THAT
355 IS KNOWN AS PHEONIX. AND EXPERIMENT NUMBER 3, THE MOB RULES
356 IS ALSO WHAT WE WOULD CALL A SNAFU. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT

369 one person can be in office at a time. So whats say we put OZZY

402 To the Phantom Writter (sic): if you care
403 about the Olympics I can get you a job as a field judge for the javelin. The only problem is you have to wear a blindfold.

406 What an arguement.  Hawthorne, if I have at all insulted you, I apologize.
407 I enjoy this system very much, and seeing someone get as angry and hurt as
408 you have saddens me.  Ignore those who wuld put you down!

410 Yes, somewhere in my collection I have a spell entitled,"Enchant Arrows To 
411 Reverse And Hit The User".  You said enchanterd, but not what sort of enchant-
412 ment...

414 Quizmaster:Any more quizzes?  Does anyone know what that one cryptogram

417 Milchar spends some time weaving a thick mat out of some reeds nearby.  With
418 The Traveller's help, it is soon done.  Whith a complicated waving gesture
419 Milchar sprinkles some fine blue dust upon the mat, which quivers twice.
420 Milchar looks quietly at the mat for a few moments, and finally says,"Alley 
421 Oop!"
422 The mat jerks another two times, and slowly rises into the air about two feet
423 off the ground.  "This will take us to Amber quite quickly- so be sure to
424 buckle up!!"  Both of the men mount the strange vehicle, and they fly off
425 into the distance., toward a city on the horizon.

428 ___Leonard___  if I gave any surprises away re: V, my apologies.
429 Despite watching the last episode on tapemyself, I forgot that there are
430 others who do also.
431 Milchar: the cryptogram goes like so--
432 JPEOD YJODO DYPPJ STFGF TUPIV
433 it was indicated that there is one null included.
434 To all who wonder why CISTOP rotates DA to DB when there may still be
435 75 lines left--did you try to get on yesterday?  Frustrating to want to
436 say something, but the last line entered is 629 no room in the Inn
437 ????
438 Todays puzzle.
439 A missionary visits an island where two tribes live.  One tribe always tells
440 the truth.  The other always lies.  The truth tellers live on the western side o
441 the island, and the liars live on the eastern side.  The missionary's problem is
442 to determine who tells the truth by asking one native only one question.  
443 The missionary, seeing a native walking in the distance, asksa a nearby native
444 "go ask that native in the distance which side of the island he lives on."
445 When the messenger returns he answers "He says he lives on the western side
446 of the island."  
447 Is the messenger a truth teller or a liar?  How can you be sure?????
448 Notice that this takes place on an island with "natives"?  Of course normal
449 WASPS couldn't be capable of lying.  Notice that the Truth Tellers are on
450 the WEST, and the liars are on the EAST?  Built-in political prejudices?  
451 And of course our hero is a Missionary.  Able to divine right and wrong
452 with a single blow!       Anyway.....

585 Bravo Hawthorne!  A definite improvement, more in the style I like
586 to see on the Backwater.  My only complaint is forty columns wastes 
587 an awful lot of space.  It also scroll past rather quickly, so I have
588 to keep hitting ^S to pause while I catch up.  What Really bugs me though
589 is that I had about 25 lines to enter, and there is not enough room left
590 on the disk.  CISTOP MIKEY, you've been neglecting the maintainance lately.
591 Milchar--If I had been able to enter my prose, I would have been on my
592 way to join you.  Since it has been over two years since I read the Amber
593 books, I don't remember the Ruby valley.  Could you tell me where I
594 can find references, so I can review?
595 :::::::::::::::::::::::O O:::::::voyeur:::::O O:::::::::::::::::::::::
596 Grand Dragonmaster--Our meetings at the PorSFiS meetings have not resulted in
597 any real conspiracy to direct the story lines here at Backwater.  You must admit, BW seems to be rather slow lately,
598 and we did decide to try writing a story based on a common beginning.  This resulted in the Kolumbia fiasco.  Those of
599 us that like the mulitauthored stories though maybe a little cohesion would help, but......::::O O::voyeur:::O O::::::::

601  yawn.. nothing happening over here either... back to DA...
