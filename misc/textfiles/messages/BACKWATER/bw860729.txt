41      Darkness surrounds me, sparks occasionally have occured, but 
42 on  the  whole darkness has held fast.  It isn't entirely   dark, 
43 there are varying shades,  but it has done no good to follow  the 
44 lighter  shades,  always  they have only lead to yet darker  ways 
45 losing what I even have.  
46      I even have tried the opposite,  seeking the dark  ways.  If 
47 the  light  would not lead to lighter,  then perhaps  the  darker 
48 would.   Yet  I  only  achieved  getting  further  lost  in  this 
49 demensionless   maze   of  nothingless.   That  all   there   is, 
50 nothingness...
51      Stumbling,  moving without direction,  unable to stay in one 
52 position,  I  continue to try to find a way out.  The way becomes 
53 rougher,  what  little vision I have left becomes  distorted  and 
54 warped.  The further I go the rougher it gets.  Then the darkness 
55 shifts suddenly,  and I stumble.  Then I am falling... falling... 
56 falling...  
57      The  world crashes to a halt,  and I am laying prone  on  my 
58 stomache unable to move,  unable to breath.  The darkness remains 
59 unbroken,  no sound,  only the cold hard darkness closing in. The 
60 ground  beneath me unyelding.  My body no longer reasponds to  my 
61 desires. Unable to move, the tears well up unbidden. I scream out 
62 into the darkness,  but not even echos return, The darkness sucks 
63 the cries into its ever gapping maw. 
64      The  loneliness always an ever present companion  overwhelms 
65 and  enfolds me in its embrace.  I am lost in both mind and soul. 
66 The direction and motivation is gone.  And now I can't even move. 
67 A cold wetness encloses me, I give in to it sinking even lower.
68      I  will  my  arm  to move,  but  it  doesn't.  The  coldness 
69 encloses me tighter. I'm alone. And only the tears come, building 
70 a pool around me. Where have I gone? What have I done? How did it 
71 happen?  Did I do this,  or was it done to me? All I know is that 
72 I'm alone, and the darkness offers no comfort. 
73 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
74 spooky.....
75 Oh well, anyway people, this is probably my last entry on BWMS.  I am
76 leaving Thursday for Seattle and will not be back.  It's been great f

97 ello, kids.  Here's a little story I wrote while waiting for my roomate to wrap-up his little party.  It's one a-m, and
98 this guy has to work tommorow.  In any case, on with a little story about the aggrivators of the future.

101 Waves distort the flat surface of the ocean.  At a distance it is a calm and 
102 quiet ocean, but at the surface, gravity has its whims with it.  Waves, 
103 coldness and sand flow through it as a part of those slight lunar whims.
104     Above the ocean stands a man.  On the rocks that tower above the 
105 water, he looks down and sees more than the plain ocean alone.  It is a 
106 flower amidst the waves, a white and dewdrenched lotus, with a sweet scent.
107     Then on the waves is a sight of him at the lotus, enchanted with the 
108 essence, and rapt with it.  In one moment, it is a picture of him at the 
109 lotus, aged, dirty, restless and staring at it.  Another moment, the lotus 
110 is gone, the man sits filthy alone.
111     The man on the rocks looks away from the ocean.  The pictures there 
112 fade and are gone in time.  And a tear does appear at his eyelids after 
113 time.  Once the act of sobbing is done with, he deserts the rocks, the 
114 ocean, and the tides to attend to his other duties.

175 We are all set up to do the run on Saturday. 1276.e Virdex setup will be used
176 as planned.
177 
178 Also, Patsy said that the ladies will take care of any food needs. The only
179 thing we need is our guts to fill!!
180 
181 Anyway, be sure to bring all of the necessary cans needed to run the 1276.e
182 system.  Also, any EQ's and the like that will fit the Virdex we be needed to
183 do the nessessary setup.  Other than that all you need to bring is yourself and
184 a few cold ones!!!  See you there

199 I found the 1296 Chips that you
200 were looking for in the
201 back of my car.  The only
202 thing I have to say about 
203 the run is that if we
204 can't get the new Virdex
205 Unit in to replace the old 
206 one, we can't run the 
207 new Telex unit.?.? or can
208 we????  I talked to the ladies
209 also and I think it should
210 work great! 
211 Are you going to be at 
212 the next meeting?
213 ohhh!! crap, before I forget...
214 I did get that new antenna
215 that Jim talked about
216 at the last convention.
217 It should make ionization of
218 the Sodium compounds much 
219 easier, and no more Nitrogen
220 trihalides!!!!
221 So that's all from here. (This
222 BBS should work great for us!)

233 it again in the not too distant future. I was somewhat disapointed that

248 	Across wide lawns and cultured flowers drifted
249 	The conversation of the highly trained.
250  
251 	Two gardeners watched them pass and priced their shoes:
252 	A chauffeur waited, reading in the drive,
253 	For them to finish their exchange of views;
254 	It seemed a picture of the private life.
255  
256 	Far off, no matter what good they intended,
257 	The armies waited for a verbal error
258 	With all the instruments for causing pain:
259  
260 	And on the issue their charm depended
261 	A land laid waste, with all its young men slain,
262 	Its women weeping, and its towns in terror.

268 John(530)....
269 
270 O.k. guy, I received your message o.k. and I have a few comments.  First, we
271 will have to try the new Telex unit at some other time.  Why? Because it is the
272 first of it's kind utilizing microprocessor control.  The original ROM's are of
273 no use in this area.  I ordered the new ones last week as so far nothing as
274 appeared. Therefore we will just have to forget using it till next session.

275 
276 Also, be sure to bring that new antenna so we can try it out. It was really
277 intended for use on the Telex, but it should work on either system. I guess we
278 will find out, won't we??  However, be sure to bring the old one in the rare
279 case that the new one either won't work with the Virdex or is defective for
280 some strange reason.
281 
282  One more thing.. Since you found the chips I will return the ones that I
283 picked up this week.  Those damn things cost $150 a piece and I cannot forsee
284 any time in the future where I will need those little jewels again.  I'd like
285 to have my $600 back in my pocket instead of being in my "spare parts" bin. Boy
286 I'm glad you found those little suckers.  I have never seen any one item
287 inflate so much in any one year before. Just out of curiosity, when did you get
288 the ones you have and how much did you give for them. They ran for about $25 a
289 piece last year.
290 
291 Anyway, Did you give Bob the number to this system and tell him how to leave
292 and read messages.  If not do so and let's get him on here!
293 O.K.???
294 Talk to you later

307 Question: Does the Phantom of Backwater ever use mechanical laughter?
308 Virdex guys: I assume you are being careful with the bus arbitrators in your
309 system. You *have* read the reports on the effects of pull-down noise caused
310 by virdi in HF equipment. Also, distortion due to heat in the FFU can cause
311 logic errors, because the n^2mos wafers in the Virdex will bubble if exposed
312 to temps greater than 90 degrees centigrade. I guess the manufacturer tried
313 to cover that up, but the government uncovered the problem during Tempest
314 testing of field units.

323 In any case, here is the actual product, if not too late
324 and too little (which has NEVER been the case at Backwater).
325 A man walked up to the Auto-Eat window and typed in his selection.  He then
326 slipped his CurrencyCard into the slot just above the keyboard and just below
327 the display.  The display, by the way, was proudly displaying his choice, or
328 at least it's image at what his choice should, at least, resemble.
329     The man waited impatiently for his selection to be delivered nice and
330 hot and ready for consumming.  He folded his arms and waited.  Soon, the
331 dispensory slotpned, motors inside whirred, the console said "Thank You!"
332 in a cheerful monotone, and his selection was coughed up.
333      The man scowled and looked under the cover bearing the words,
334 "TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS SERVED" in bold emblazend letters, and he scowled

378 
379 
380 Due to the excessive number of absences from the office, the following rules
381  and procedures will be put into effect as of this date:
382 
383 SICKNESS NO EXCUSE:  We will no longer accept your doctor's statement as
384  proof, as we believe that if you are able to go to the doctor, you are able
385  to come to work.
386 
387 DEATH:  (Other than your own)  This is no excuse; there is nothing you can do
388 for them, and we are sure that someone else with a lesser position can attend
389 to the arrangements.  However, if the funeral can be held in the late
390 afternoon, we will be glad to let you off one hour early, provided that your
391 share of the work is ahead enough to keep the job going in your absence.
392 
393 LEAVE OF ABSENCE:  (For an Operation) We are no longer allowing this practice.
394 We wish to discourage any thoughts that you may need an operation as we believe
395 as long as you are an employee here, you will need all of whatever you have and
396 you should not consider having anything removed.  We hired you as you are and
397 to have anything removed would certainly make you less than we bargained for.
398 
399 DEATH:  (Your own) This will be accepted as an excuse, but we would like a two
400 week notice as we feel it is your duty to train someone else for your job.
401 
402 Also, entirely too much time is being spent in the restrooms.  In the future,
403 we will follow the practice of going in alphabetical order.  For instance,
404 those whose name begins with an "A" will go from 8:00 to 8:15, "B" will go from
405 8:15 to 8:30, and so on.  If you are unable to go at the designated time, it
406 will be necessary to wait until the next day when your turn comes around again.

442      Something was wrong, I could sense it. I had just returned from a 
443 rather lengthy trip to nowhere, and I could tell that something was 
444 wrong the minute I stepped into my apartment. Perhaps it was the barely 
445 percepital smell of fine machine oil, and the faint tint of ozone in the 
446 air. Or perhaps the drifting gerble hair that caused me to sneeze 
447 (I always was allergic to small furry animals). 
448      Tense and strung on adrenaline, I quietly closed the door and 
449 looked about, I didn't see anything out f the ordinary, but still I knew 
450 something was wrong. Moving down the short hall, I turned to the right 
451 and stepped into the living room. Something was wrong, but I couldn't 
452 put my finger on it.
453      I stood there for a moment, pondering what it was that was 
454 bothering me, and then I realized that the computer was on and a CD ROM 
455 was in the drive. As the impact of it struck me (I had left the computer 
456 off, and I didn't even *own* a CD ROM drive!), I heard a metalic click. 
457 Turning about quickly I found myself face to face with my opponent. I 
458 didn't know who he was, but he seemed formidable enough. "Who are you? 
459 What do you want? Why are you in my apartment? How did you get in? 
460 (My journalistic instincts automatically taking over.) The only response 
461 I received was laughter with metalic overtones. 
462      I edged towards the door in the hopes of escaping. But quicker then 
463 I could see, he grabbed my arm and spun me about. Before I could scream 
464 out, I found my mouth tapped shut, and my arms tied behind me. 
465      As I lay on the floor, he moved out of my vision. I heard a 
466 rustling sound, then he was back a smile on his face and a sringe in his 
467 hand. Wide eyed, I watched the needle enter my arm as I heard the faint 
468 whine of fine tuned servos...whine? Of course! As I lay there, I felt 
469 the drug begin to take effect, I tried to speak the fateful words, 
470 conciousness fading in and out in a rapdly increasing pulsating 
471 stream...the world began to darken, "Duex ex ma... ma... ghaaaa......"

520 "Sam? Sam get the hell in here. We just got a directive from upstairs." Fred
521 hated directives from upstairs. On top of his normal animosity towards
522 directives, this latest edict from above contained extra reasons for worry.
523 "Ya Fred, what's all the commotion in here? Can't you see I'm working on
524 important stuff?"
525 "Can it Sam, this is important. Direct from the big guy. We have a glitch
526 in the 'droids we gotta fix fast, including retro-fits on all active units.
527 It appears that some of the units's lubrication module is going way before
528 MTBF. According to this directive, 40% of the units have experienced this
529 failure in the past two weeks."
530 "But that's impossible. Those IM2's are supposed to go 6 months without
531 a checkup, worst case scenario!"
532 "Hey, I'm just reading what the guys upstairs send down. We don't question
533 why, remember?"
534 "Ok, sure, whatever you say Fred. I'll go get the floor model." Sam walked
535 out of the room while Fred turned around and unlocked a large red locker
536 with stenciled letters spelling out 'IM2' on the front of it. Opening the
537 locker, he reached down and lifted a large rectangular case up onto the
538 work bench. He dialed in a number of a special multi-combination lock. At
539 the last number, the top of the case flipped open, revealing a maze of
540 wires and switches all hooked up to a brushed stainless steel box set inside
541 he case. He pressed a green button marked 'S', and the box beeped once.
542 Fred smiled as he took two probes in his hand, and waited for Sam to return.

546 Mikey: 1000 apologies for not calling Saturday. It is a long story which I

548 together a nice collection of routines for the project. Is next Saturday

552 PARKINSON'S LAW: The bad drives out the good.
553 I remember back in the mid 60's when CB was a means of communication. When the
554 late 70's rush hit, all the "good" CB'ers either went to sidebanding, or ham
555 radio, or quit.

559            Were you ever on C.B. in the past??  I like your realating story to
560 that lost form of fun and it got me
561 wondering if you once were??

568 PETE: MESSAGE RECEIVED, WHOTS HAPPENING?
569 <><><><><><>><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><<><>
570 
571 ttt     I agree with Leonard. Nowadays, modems are convenient peripherals
572 that you can get along with your new MS-DOS machine. There is little more
573 to it.  Even Commodore had the nerve to make their modems so flaky that

574 people not dedicated couldn't use them.  Instead of those fun filled days
575 of yesteryear, we have repoutable companies churning out modems at a slim
576 thirty dollar price tag.  So any indedicated jerk can technically screw
577 up any public system.
578         I don't know what sidebanding is. It strikes me as a method to
579 hide or scramble a signal, such that it would have to be known about in
580 advance to be heard. And -that- strikes me as what a lot of systems have
581 done. The Bit Bucket is not gone, not really. Because, most likely, there
582 is still going to be a collection of friends with Unix access. I have
583 heard that same idea thrown around about all the other Unix boards now
584 operating in town. Not public. Only friends. And new friends are made on
585 the public systems, if necessary.
586         After returning from a long trip, I was sort of stunned to find
587 that three quarters of all the old BWMS users had faded away. Stopped
588 wasting their eraly mornings or late nights on it. There are only a few
589 reasons for this. But I -don't- want to get into an argument over who is
590 to blame for the overall sad state of affairs. Its just true that Piper
591 isn't going to read this. Pam probably won't. Neither will most of the
592 people who made this system an exception to the rule.
593         The question that has been going through my mind lately, is "What
594 is going to happen to BackWater now? What about the people I met there?
595 Are we just going to fade into squalid files in those Archives?"
596         If only I had the answer. For now, the only thing I can do is
597 enjoy what writing (Of the elder style, not the recent ultraverbose and
598 overemotional sort that was pioneered by J. Silverman, and D. S. Knight.
599 As a way to preserve an old feeling. At least till it picks up again.

623 BACKWATER will survive because the backbone users of this system will do every-
624 thing they can to save it. I am not writing about the transitory hit-and-run
625 authors so popular of late. I am talking about the oft-spoken of old-timers
626 who have gone on to other personnas and are speaking in different tongues. BW
627 will endure because they will endure. They will not let this unique and
628 enjoyable system fade away. It means too much.		French Toast __________
