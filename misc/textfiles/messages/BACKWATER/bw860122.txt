21    The ship descended slowly over a little used landing field on the outskirts of Harrakus, a minor city in the
22 province of Shai-Kahn. A dozen people watched from a blast shelter on the edge of the field. They were very
23 anxious.
24    The ship was about ten meters off the ground when the cargo hatch exploded in a huge blast of blue flame, sending
25 the door sailing in a high arc over the heads of the startled watchers. The blast took out one of the three antigrav
26 generators and the ship listed to one side. Trailing flames, if descended as a shallow angle until it slammed into the
27 ground on the edge of the port. There it sat and burned fiercely.
28    Emergency vehicles were called in and within moments the fire was under control. They pulled the pilot out, who was
29 injured but expected to recover. The shielding in the cockpit had saved his life. The rest of the ship was a loss,
30 including the cargo, which had been literally reduced to ashes.
31    Watching all this from the relative safety of a ditch about three hundred meters away James turned to Tariya and
32 said, "What'd I tell you? Now that they think I'm dead we'll be left alone to find out just what the hell's going
33 on."
34    Tariya nodded, stil a little shakey. She hadn't quite recovered from the ride on that cargo door yet. "Just one
35 thing. When you told me about this insane escape scheme you forgot to mention how we were going to survive the
36 landing. I don't think I've been more terrified in my entire life."
37    James laughed, "It was quite a ride, wasn't it? I covered us with a telekinetic cocoon to absorb the impact. That
38 was what I used to save our butts back when we first landed on that sick planet."
39    "Whatever you say," She replied, "But next time, please warn me."
40    He took her arm. "Let's get out of here before they before they start combing the area for debris."
41    As they walked into the city, James noticed for the first time the strange dichotomy that was Kadan's trademark.
42 Most of the structures were made from stone and morter, but here and there were pre-fab building of sheet steel and
43 other metals. Horses were tethered next to high-speed gravcars and micro two-seater aircraft. Towards the direction of
44 downtown steel and concrete towers rose against the sky. Through an administrative error, the Galactic Federation had
45 introduced the planet to technology far earlier than it was scheduled. By the time the error was caught, it was far
46 too late. For the last 170 years, Kadan had been struggling to keep up with its new technological heritage and its
47 older, magical one. Kadan could be a very dangerous place.
48    But there was something else, something even more strange. It took James a moment to place it: there were no
49 people. The streets were deserted and there was a strange, tense feel in the air. He asked Tariya and she had no idea
50 what it was, either.
51    And James wasn't feeling all that well, either. In fact, he felt downright sick. As usual, he had pushed himself
52 too far, too soon, and, as usual, he was paying for it. The dull pain in his stomach was growing steadily worse by the
53 second.
54    Tariya stoped and turned when she heard a groan. James was collapsed against a building, curled up in a ball.
55 Frightened, she knelt down by him and saw from the grimace on his face that he was in incredible pain. "Oh, God, what
56 is it? What's wrong?"
57    But he was in a world of his own at th moment, a world of pain. Under his breath he kept muttering, "Not now please
58 not now oh sh-" and his voice turned into a thin wheeze as the breath was squeezed out of him. All the pain he had
59 ever felt in the past paled before this. Right then, he wanted to die.
60    After several endless moments, it slowly subsided. His muscles unlocked and he collapsed against the wall. His mind
61 seemed to shut down and he could comprehend nothing that he was seeing or hearing. That had been a bad one. Eventually
62 Tariya's voice broke through his daze and he gasped, "It's okay. I'm fine now."
63    "The hell you are!" she snapped, angry and scared. "You've been hiding something from me since we met. I don't know
64 what it is, but I heard what you said to Willerd two days ago. Something is very wrong." She put her hands on his
65 shoulders, her eyes brimming with tears. "Please. Tell me what it is."
66    He looked at her, still unsteady. Hardly any point in denying it now. "Cancer."
67    She drew back a little, stunned by his announcement. His voice wavering, he continued, "I'm dying."

82     From Prometheus; Endowed
83     There is a bitter irony in that the definition of a twit is one who taunts,
84 teases, and does the kind of things that the ring of twit-hunters (In which I
85 include myself, simply for sentimental reasons) struggle to do.
86     Another interesting derivation is twitter, which according to it's list of
87 synonyms can refer to the tension felt in the writings when twits are about.
88     To call someone twitty is tantamount to calling them irritable or eeven the
89 deadliest of insults, irksome.  Twitchy would be a stretch, but could apply.
90     For those who are offended by spelling errors, I apologize for using some
91 words whose spelling was doubtable.  I would have checked were it not for my
92 fault of slothenliness.  On the subject though, could one of you out there do a
93 fog on this disk somehow?  I would like to see how this message played out.
94     Assorted messages follow this short but startlingly accurate introduction.
95     Man in Gray;  I found a book on disguises and showed it to Retch by mistake
96 and now he wants about eighty dollars of eyeshadow.  I told him Kendall might
97 approve of his new lifestyle and all, but he still wants it.
98     Should I go out to Queen Elizabeth's Recreational Costumes and Cosmetics?
99 I know we could slip it past Salog with a smile and a limp wrist, but they just
100 might send him off on an assignment worthy of his newest preeferences.

"Now where is he?"  The Sage asked the pigeon on his ring finger.
105     The pigeon leaped from the finger and flew a scant distance.  Getting the
106 air into her feathers and strengthening the forgotten muscles.  She flapped
107 air around that stung the eyes of the Sage and whipped his hair into a tangle.
108     Refreshed, she lifted off into the darkened clouds and soon was a darker
109 blot on their surfaces.  She toyed with the winds and spiralled at will.
110     She came down to the tower where the Sage stood awaiting her.  Floating
111 aloft until the Sage noticed her she waited for his eyes to find her there.
112     When he saw her and took her onto his ring finger once mre, he knew she had
113 not found the Odd One in all the expanse she had covered.  His shoulders hung
114 low while the pigeon was tense and ready to take to flight again soon.
115     The Sage let her go off into the waning sun, hidden behind ominous clouds.
116     He packed a few sticks of cinnaamon into his pouch and stored a few tidy
117 packets of writing implements in also.  Some enscribement might have been
118 necessary for all he knew.
119     The tall Sage set off down a winding road that led through a forest.  Now
120 the forest was a thicket in the cold of Winter.  It presented a dismal passage
121 to travel through it and it absorbed whistles without letting you  hear your
122 own notes and timings.  The hours walk was a depressing one.
123     The Sage stumbled upon the little hodgel without noticing.  A warm little
124 collection of timbers, and sod that overgrew the walls, it drew the saddened
125 spirit of the Sage into it's welcoming arms.

146 WELL, NOW THE FOCUS HAS SHIFTED TO DEPRESSION, HMMMM. I HAVE A SURE CURE FOR
147 DEPRESSION. IT WILL SOUND UNUSUAL, BUT HERE IT IS. WHEN YOU GET DEPRESSED, A 
148 NATURAL REACTION IS TO TRY TO CHEER YOURSELF UP. HOWEVER, THIS SELDOM WORKS. I
149 HAVE FOUND THAT WHEN I GET DEPRESSED, A GOOD WAY TO GET OUT OF IT IS TO ATTEMPT
150 TO GET EVEN MORE DEPRESSED! GO FOR A WALK IN THE RAIN, SLIP IN A MUD PUDDLE, 
151 DRINK SOMETHING AWFUL, EAT AT MCDONALDS(THE SAME THING) LISTEN TO AN ALBUM YOU 
152 HATE. THIS WILL VERY QUICKLY SHOW YOU THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEPRESSED, AND 
153 REALLY BAD OFF, AND YOU WILL SOON BE THANKING YOUR LUCKY STARS HOW WELL OFF 
154 YOU REALLY ARE. TRY IT, IT WORKS. IF EVEN THAT FAILS, THEN LISTEN TO THE ALBUM
155 'THE WORLD'S WORST RECORDS!' PRESENTED BY THE RHINO BROTHERS.(RHINO RECORDS)
156 ANY WELL STOCKED INNER CITY PORTLAND RECORD STORE WILL HAVE IT. IN PARTICULAR,
157 I RECOMMEND THE SONG 'I LIKE', BY HEATHEN DAN. THOSE WHO HAVE LISTENED TO THE

194    The sky was a deep azure that met the horizon, blending with the glassy aquamarine of the Pacific.
195 Only the distant whitecaps on the gently rolling sea gave sense of where water ended and sky began.
196 The western sun danced across the waves, casting formless shadows of the giant ship that dipped and swirled
197 as the carriers fantail gently rose and fell; the rush of the waves punctuated by the shrill call of sea gulls far from 
198 
199    Ensign Simpson took a last puff from his cigarette and flicked it into the churning frothy water below.
200 Picking up his binoculars, he took one last look at the darkening horizon. His relief, a young second class
201 with flaming red hair had arrived. His eyes widened, and he carefully focused the powerful glasses.
202 In the distance, a tiny speck sharpened into the profile of an aircraft, approaching the USS Coral Sea.
203 The watch officer snatched up the microphone from the comm post, and pushed the red button.
204 "Stern watch, unidentified aircraft approaching..."
205 The bridge replied;"Ah, we have them in sight, sternwatch. Looks like a biz-jet. Wonder what he's
206 doing way out here..." 
207 
208    On the bridge, trained eyes studied the radar screen. The flashing blip was still approaching the Coral Sea.
209 The nav officer sang out the coordinates; 136 West 14 , 53 North 37 degrees SIR!
210 
211 Suddenly, another blip appeared on the screen, and then another; and a transponder code flashed off and on.
212 "Squaking 1421, Sir, Military aircraft in pursuit, Sir", the radar operator explained. 
213 The klaxons screamd, and the Captain spoke calmly into the PA system,"All hands general quarters..."
214 
215 30 miles to the south, the pair of F4 Phantoms dropped gear and flaps, and came alongside the stolen Lear jet. The cabin
216 "15LJ this is Air Force blue two. You will IMMEDIATELY come to 285 degrees, follow us, and land the carrier"
217 The laconical voice left no doubt that his orders would be obeyed.
218 
219    On the bridge of the Coral Sea, the captain barked orders into the microphone. The flight dwcks were cleared.
220 Three retaining nets were erevted across the flight deck...
221 The Lear descended sharply, and assumed a nose up attitude to land on the slowly rolling carrier, but dropped
222 too steeply. The two F4s shot off into the distance, their afterburners engaged.
223 The bos'un waived frantically for the Lear to go around, but as the last drops of fuel were sucked from
224 empty tanks, the port engine sputtered out. The pilot tried frantically to correct the rudder, but the
225 jet smashed into the fantail of the aircraft carrier...
226 
227    Twilight became daylight, and in an instant, the USS Coral Sea was vaporized. An ugly cloud rose into the sky.
228 The sea boiled as if it were Armageddon, which is just what it was for the 4000 men aboard the USS coral Sea.

250   Here is something that I am wondering about.  (it has to do with 
251 relationships)  I know a girl and have talked with her for a while.  We 
252 are friends.  Now!  I don't know about getting any closer, I don't know
253 if she wants to be anything more than just friens.  For the time being
254 I will just continue as I have been, just being friends.  But the hints
255 from her friends are saying otherwise.  
256   Anyway, HELP!  I knew being scared and insecurity go hand in hand with
257 high school, but this is getting silly!  Any help would be appreciated.
258 `,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,Mark.  It's a great day, get out there!
259 It was a great day, get inside!
260 ____________________________________________________________________________
261 Mark, silence is deadly. Let loose, hang it, and make a bloody fool of yourself
262 if you have to. Being scared is nothing compared to being stupid and missing
263 oppurtunities. ASK! Think your words carefully. Turn up your empathetic sensors.
264 Listen to her words, and when you feel the time is right, ASK! Her friends, if
265 they are really friends and not just playing mind games with you, are windows
266 to her mind. She will tell them things she can't tell you, hopeing they will
267 tell you, and you in turn will ASK! her. It is a sequence that has played out
268 countless times. If you act friendly and like a gentleman, your friendship will
269 not suffer. Of course I know little of your situation except what you have
270 written here, but it sounds similar to periods every male and female has been
271 through. Not knowing can hurt worse than anything. Insecurity is magnified
272 by the unknown. Whatever you do, ACT! I wish you luck.
273 
274 TED, your words are clearly written from the heart, and that is very refreshing
275 to read. You are partly responsible for this whole discussion, which is one of
276 the best, least angry rap sessions we have had in a long time. Give yourself a
277 pat on the back. I have one thing I slightly differ with you on the subject of
278 sex. For many people, far less are willing to admit to such feelings but they
279 all feel the same way, sex is much more than an physical act of self-
280 gratification. Ignore the locker room boasts of your classmates. For males, it
281 is macho and cool to speak of conquests, and in some cases, unfortunately, that
282 is all their sexual encounters are. I won't attempt to speak on the female 
283 point of view, there are many here who can though. Beyond the boasting and
284 posturing, there are caring individuals who look upon the actions of sex as 
285 being one of the beautiful expressions of feelings possible. To make your
286 partner happy and content is a wonderful way to make your feelings known. The
287 communication that happens when two are joined as one is unequaled anywhere
288 else. Sex is physically enjoyable, there is no denying that, but it is also
289 mentally and spiritually enjoyable, if you allow yourself to feel those
290 emotions. There certainly are no rules on whether sex should or should not be
291 a part of every relationship, and I agree with you that society puts undue
292 amounts of pressure on people in that area, but each couple must decide for
293 themselves what is right for them. Forget what anyone else would like you
294 to do. Be true to yourselves. In spite of what we might think listening to
295 people talk, most everyone is after a meaningful, close relationship with a
296 person they can talk to, trust, be friends with, share interests with, learn
297 from, teach, and, if it is right, be with sexually. I have a feeling that you
298 think this way already. You do not strike me as a macho-hungry male out to
299 dazzle the world. Let's keep the discussion going.

313 SOMETHING ON GAMES PEOPLE PLAY: I WAS INTERESTED BY THE COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT
314 FRIENDS COMMUNICATING. THIS SCENARIO: BOY MEETS GIRL, BOTH ARE TWO SHY TO
315 SAY ANYTHING DIRECTLY TO EACH OTHER. SO, GIRL TELLS HER FRIENDS SHE LIKES BOY, AND BOY TELLS HER FRIENDS HE 
316 LIKES GIRL. THEN, THEY BOTH LISTEN TO THEIR FRIENDS REPORTS ON EACH OTHERS FEELINGS BEFORE THEY DECIDE TO DO 
317 ANYTHING.
318 HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE ENGAGED IN THOSE KINDS OF GAMES? WE ALL HAVE! IT'S GREAT FUN, AND A GOOD WAY TO KEEP
319 YOUR NECK FROM BEING CUT OFF. I SUPPOSE IT IS KIND OF SILLY, YOU SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO SAY YOUR FEELINGS,

321      ABOUT SEXUAL RELATIONS, I DO INDEED AGREE ABOUT THE ABOVE COMMENTS ON SEX. BUT, AS MY ENGLISH TEACHER ONCE
322 SAID, "IT'S VERY HARD TO WRITE WELL ABOUT SEX. THAT'S WHY THERE IS SO MUCH TRASH WRITING ABOUT IT ON THE MARKET" 
323 SHE WAS REFERRING, OF COURSE, TO THE SUPERMARKET PULP ROMANCES. I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH HER. SO, WHILE I WILL 
324 COMMENT ON LOVE, AND WHATEVER ELSE, I WILL ATTEMPT TO REFRAIN ABOUT WRITING ABOUT SEX. (IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN).
325 AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, THERE IS NOTHING QUITE LIKE SEX, WHEN IT'S GOOD IT'S BETTER THAN ANYTHING. WHEN IT'S BAD
326 , IT'S REALLY BAD.
327    AT LEAST, THE HIGH POWERED DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING ABOUT A TOPIC THAT EMBARRESES MANY, HAS KEPT THE

358 Depression Cure: I agree with the idea that to cure depression one must get
359 SEVERELY depressed.  I go about this by listening to, in order:
360 Pink Floyd: Collection of Dance Songs/Dark Side of the Moon/Relics

362 I hope to expand both collections, and so be able to remove depression more
363 quickly in the future.  Final Cut, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall should do
364 it nicely.
365 On the other hand, another highly sucessful way of curing depression is to
366 force yourself to go to a party, as I am this weekend.  A term has gone by,
367 time once more to visit the Doctor in Eugene.  See you next week,

379 Ah! It's like the good old days. The twits are back. Time for a good old fashion
380 ed twit hunt. All this stuff about relieving depression by making ones self
381 feel even more depressed is stupid. If you sprained your right ankle, would
382 you then go out and sprain the left? Cut off your nose to spite your face?
383 If you burned your hand on a hot stove would you stick it back on the burner
384 in the belief that doing so would make it feel better? Stupid. Unless depression
385 has reached the point where one is totally unable to function (which requires
386 hospitalization) there is SOMETHING that will start the process of overcoming
387 this melancholia. Whether it is a giant gooey 'with everything' banana split
388 at Robertos in the Galleria, forcing ones self to take a vacation, kicking 
389 the dog, getting drunk, or whatever, there is ALWAYS something to start with.
390 No one, no matter how depressed, hates EVERYTHING. So do something GOOD for
391 yourself. Not something bad.

402 mark, it's easy...just take a deep breath and...tell her you
403 like her.  i can't speak for every girl but i think guys like
404 you, who are concerned enough to ask advice are great.  it's so
405 sweet to have a guy say he likes you as long as he's not pushing
406 himself on you or swearing his undying love to you when you've known
407 him for a week.  just let her know you care and take it from there..

431 Leonerd: I just picked up a HP thinkjet for the M100, which is what I was
432 going to origionaly use the CGP-115 for. I would like to have the CGP, but
433 if you have a use for it, then it's yours. I think, however, that 
434 Dreamtoucher still wants to sell his, so there should be one avalible 
435 for me. Fun little printers, they plot, and they can fit 80 columns on
436 four inch paper.

438 can I discuss him with you at Emm Ell Cee say around 1:15 in the afternoon?

445   Moressy -- go for what purpose?  (I can't give you reccommendations without
446 knowing what things you like, probably not then if I don't share your likes.)
447 If you want to meet folks, go to things you like to do -- you've got a
448 better than average chance of meeting folks there that share at least one
449 like with you.
450   Personally, I stay indoors in winter, head for the mountains or beach in
451 the summer.  There are lots of folks that like to ski -- if you don't
452 mind snow it's fun (brrr... nasty white stuff! Water should remain liquid
453 as the Ghreat Ghod Ghu intended all along!).
454   All -- once in the great long ago, there was a Backwater Not-A-Pizza Party.

"Odd thing, for me not to have noticed this before,"  Muttered the Sage.
462     He knelt onto the leaves and twigs and inspected the timbers of it, finding
463 that they were of cedar and not even months old.  The stains of wet dust and
464 rain were well earned if they had been gotten in a month.
465     Pushing at the door, he stood back and watched what the opening of the door
466 would let him see.  Inside, it was dark and bleak as it was outside, a pair of
467 stoves stood oppposite each other for warmth, and individual candles provided
468 thhe light for the whole thing.
469     The Sage assumed the Odd One had better taste than to enter ino this bit
470 of gloom, and shut the door, going on his way to the Inn.
471     A shout spilled out of the closing door and found the Sage down the road.
472     The Sage ran back to the dismal hodgel and found himself staanding in the
473 doorway, preparing to fend off anyone who threatened the owner of the voice
474 that had shouted.  For the Odd One owned it, and it was not easiily mistaken.
475     "Doom you, and your wife,"  Said the Odd One to a short and lean man who
476 had the look of someone in authority.  Since the Odd One had his back turned,
477 the Sage thought it best to approach the bar and make no suprises for him.
478     "I assure you,"  Said the timid little man with a voice as creaky as his
479 door, "These drinks are on the house, the way paid by a gentleman of reknown,"
480     "Thank you,"  Slurred the Odd One.  In a stupor, he rose the drink to his
481 lips and poured the whole thing down.  Drunken once again, he fell into his
482 stool and grumbled proudly about his reputation and ethics.
483     "Fellow!  Fellow,"  Said the Sage to the drunken Odd ONne, "Can you hear?"
484     "I would say not, if you would like, here is a rink for you, while you wait
485 for him,"  Volunteered the timid little barkeep.
486     "No thank you,"  Said the Sage out loud, not looking at any but the broken
487 frame of the Odd One.  "Wake, dear fellow, wake and I'll take you home,"
488     The Odd One lingered a moment and rose his head.  His eyes were engulfed
489 in blackened flame, that removed all his eyes from view.  "I don't want to go,"
490     "Lord,"  Said the Sage, stumbling back from the Odd One, and onto the floor
491 below, "What is this!"  The little man was at him in a second, trying to pour
492 the stale liquid down his throat.  Eventually, the Sage succumed, and drank.

508 Well, sounds like some good cures for depression.  How about a good cure for
509 boredom?  I seldom get depressed but often get bored.  Hmmm...
510 I'm off to a toga party saturday night and just wondering if anyone can
511 find a cure for my usual sunday afternoon boredom, provided my head is
512 still intact.
513     Ho hum.  How I hate doing homework on Fridays!

590 The Innkeeper awoke with a start. The cold damp draft had put a chill in
591 his legs. Getting up, he moved to the soot embraced hearth, and stired the
592 coals to bring up the fire, and sacraficed another log to the ever hungry
593 flames. The fire quickly claimed its prize, and greedily licked at the 
594 coarse bark. Throwing showers of sparks as it attacked the moss and lichen
595 that sheathed the wood. Closing the screen, the Innkeeper stepped back from
596 the new emerging heat of the fire. 
597 It was then that he spied the Piper half dozing in a nearby chair. As the
598 heat from the newborn fire reached him, the Piper looked up to see the 
599 source. He saw the Innkeeper standing there his back turned to the fire
600 warming his cold body. Smiling, the Piper said "Just lurking". 
601 Chuckling, the Innkeeper responded "What? Just lurking? Not working?
