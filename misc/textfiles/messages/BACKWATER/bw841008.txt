Note: Apparently someone decided to delete the entire disk. I had a recovery
program that would undelete the stuff and was going to run it on this disk
to recover the deleted information. Unfortunately, I Accidently ran the disk 
through the wrong program which erased the first character of each line. 
You might note that some lines appear twice that is because they were properly
deleted lines, but since the undelete undeletes all lines, even the properly 
deleted lines become visible. 
Also noticable on this disk for the first time is the notice at the end  
indictaing the total number of lines on the disk. With this disk I changed 
the archive method. I used to just log on to BWMS and list the entire disk, 
capturing the contents with my communications program. With this disk, I 
changed to using a CP/M program to read the disk and copy the contents to 
a CP/M file. This change was triggered by the need to undelete the disk.

32  e had always thought of women as being one of the greatest of God's
33  reations. They have been the ones who have carried many of our most human

69     Sunrise at sea, on a clear morning, is surely the one referred to in the
70  ong. All the world does indeed seem to be waiting for that instant when the
71  irst rays of the sun spill over the horizon, spreading out to embrace the
72  ew day. Up since first light, the ancient practitioner had taken his star
73  ights, adjusted his reckoned position, and settled down on deck with a cup
74  f freshly brewed 'Ethiopian Mocha Harrar', awaiting the morning spectacular.
75  He would just have to imagine that famous cream that the piper speaks of!)
76  e always enjoyed the satisfaction of using simple instruments and the 
77  nowledge in his own head, no high-tek toys on this craft. At the urgent 
78  nsistence of some of his friends, he had taken the multi-phase transmuter
79  long. Anyway, when out of sight of land, only the communication function 
80  orked, and not too well at that. He supposed it had something to do with
81  he fact it operates on the emanations of the collective consciousness. In    
82  ny event, lately events at the Backwater Inn had been leaking through the
83  ransmuter. Flickering images and sound that faded in and out made it hard
84  o discern what was happening (not uncommon even on a clear day).
85     Alex's plight of being caught in the St. Helen wind-vacuum was a fate 
86  e could identify with. Once in a previous incarnation he had skippered a
87  oat in a race called the 'six-pak'. (Heaven only knows why--they must have
88  onsumed several cases during the race.) He remembered that when the wind
89  id blow near St. Helen it blew straight down. The only place that was more 
90  emorable for such phenomena was south-west of Guadalupe. Becalmed in the
91  ee of Guadalupe again, but that's another story...

95  s I made my way to the camp site, Scout following closely behind me, I heard the sound of something diving at
96  igh speed.  FLOOM !  What in the world was that?  Looking behind me, I was forced to laugh.  My brave steed
97  as attempting to hide behind a Ponderosa Pine seedling.  After I stopped laughing, I wondered what a Ponderosa
98  ine seedling was doing here, certainly not its native habitat.  Off to one side, I saw a stone marker and went
99  ver to read it.

115  Hey, has everyone seen this sign ?" I cried.  No one had.  I looked around me and saw a holly tree, a cyprus,
116   banyan, a palm (not really a tree, I thought, but the idea was good), and a whole collection of trees that
117  ould not grow in these parts, all healthy and straight and tall.  It was obvious that many had come and gone and
118  ot returned for their tree.  I began to fear for the lives of our band of adventurers.  Taking a small twig
119  rom my belt (the same twig that I had snatched as I fell at the Inn so long ago.)  I planted it carefully,
120  atered it, and knelt by it to pray.  Finishing my prayer, I heard a mournful tune played on what sounded like a 
121  andolin.  I wandered off in the direction the sound came, and saw a pleasant campfire, along with the main
122  ncampment of the group.

128  HOOOOSSHH!!! The Manticore swept by, nearly taking a piece of Milchar with him.  a Power Word: Stun hampered the 
129  east for a moment, and Milchar remembered how he had taken care of the last Manticore... "GHRED! NYTOL! FYGOX! ZEATT!!
130  , Milchar cried.  The Manticore, shrinking rapidly, flew off as he was being chased by a nearby bird...
131  t that moment, Milchar heard the Friar call out something about a sign.  Walking briskly, he found the Friar and some
132  thers reading sign made of Adamant.  "Ahh, the Legend of the Tree.  I have planted two trees here, but took them back
133  o my tower.  I would think that our camp near here would be safer than it is.  I fear something is amiss.  We had 
134  etter drive harder tomorrow, I wish to be there early.  No telling what might happen if Dimat's protecive spells have

137  arfaal-Durath was happy.  He was watching the village burn.  With a few people in it.  Somehow he thought that 
138  ilariously funny.  There was another target...  Another gout of Cold Emerald Force rained down on the unfortunate soul.
139  e didn't feel much.  Narfaal turned his attention to the construction of the hold, and saw that it would be finished 
140  omorrow morn.  "Good, I shall have a use for it when those bungling upstarts arrive.  Hargo!  Begin the preparations

144  , God.  It's happened again.  It all started when my Aunt Dorothy (known as
145  otty for reasons soon to become apparent) taught me about soul-travel.  She
146  ould get me to concentrate.  Really concentrate.  And we would go ANYWHERE.
147  e started out doing hard stuff-going to other galaxies, meeting bizarre life
148  orms, but that was too strange and uncomfortable for me, so I started going
149  o just Disneyland, the Flaming Gorge, and to this place in Nepal where I
150  eally liked the light.  Dorothy said she got the idea from watching the 
151  izard of Oz because that girl was Dorothy, too.  Unfortunately, Dorothy died
152  actually, I think she went off with a boyfriend somewhere over the rainbow)
153  efore she taught me how to control this stuff.  So whenever I'm really ATTEN=
154  ING to something, I suddenly find myself somewhere else.  Like during the
155  ob interview when I was whisked off to Afghanistan.  It's not easy learning
156  o fight Russians, speak Pushtu and ride a camel in a suit and high heels
157  me, not the camel) And now, while balancing on a ladder, cleaning the gutter,
158  eeping branches out of my face, and leaning and reaching just SO...I'm
159  onfronted with a medieval-looking bunch on horse- and UNICORN-back, with
160  ssorted musical instruments planting a tree.  Are they hostile? Do they speak
161  n Indo European language?  Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy, why didn't you teach

171    The piper felt the air growing cool on his seat astride the Pegasus.  The
172  arty seemed to have gathered on the edge of a bleak plain, near an isolated
173  roup of trees.  Leaning forward, the piper saw that Milchar, somewhat isolated,
174  as in trouble!  Urging his steed to greater speed, he prepared to attack just
175  s the monster shrank and dwindled down unti it was no threat.  Urging the
176  egaus upward, the piper traded speed for altitude, and flew upward until 
177  he party was almost indistinguishable below him.  At what must have been 
178  early a thousand feet, the piper and his steed broke into the beams of the
179  etting sun, and those of the party below must have seen a rather spectacular
180  ight as the white wings of the great Pegasus were painted with the brilliant
181  rimson of the setting sun.  Locking his nknees around the feathered bases
182  f the giant wings supporting him and his steed, the piper inflated his pipes,
183  nd played the haunting tune called "A Highland Lullaby."
184   At the conclusion of the tune, the piper glided in silence, then smelling
185  he sharp pungent smell of wood smoke looked back and saw that the party had
186  ighted a fire and was preparing for their dinner.  During his period of 
187  meditation" (all right, daydreaming at altitude) he and his steed had strayed
188  uite far from the party, and diving out of the last rays of the sun, they
189  egan a great sweeping turn that would eventually bring them back to the party.
190  carcely had they left the brilliant rays, than the piper's attention was 
191  rawn to a small tent, pitched high on a bare, wind-swept ridge with a 
192  amiliar-appearing figure before it.  The Pegasus stalled in mid-air and took
193  early 800 feet to recover, then sidelsipped down to a landing near the lonely
194  igure.  "L'Homme!" the piper exclamed.  "What are you doing here?  The last
195  e had heard of you, you had joined the NET, and were somewhere with some
196  trange religious cult --- But never mind that now, we are off on another

200      In his haste to get to the far hill, to see if he could help the others
201  ith their upcoming fight againt that horrid winged creature, L'homme wasn't
202  eally paying much attention to anything that might approach from above. A
203  hriek broke the still air, and the evil looking creature appeared to fly
204  ith great speed away from the hill the party had landed at. "I guess I can
205  low down a bit. They didn't need my help after all.", thought L'homme to
206  imself. "I should have known there would be some omnipotent character over
207  here." A sudden woosh of air grabbed L'homme's attention away from the hill,
208  s a creature he couldn't identify landed near him. Fortunately, it carried a
209  ider he could identify. "Piper!", L'homme exclaimed. "Long time no see!"
210  he piper was an old friend from L'homme's Inn days. After dispensing with the
211  sual amenities and a brief history of the past few months, Piper asked L'homme
212  f he would like to join the party in their quest to the Amber Valley.
213  I was sent here for something. I don't know exactly what, but your offer sounds
214  s good as anything else I have had for the past week. Sure I'll come along! But
215  ne small problem...Who ever sent me here neglected to provide me with a mode

217  You mean you have been separated from the old Blue Mustang?", queried Piper.
218  Yes. Tis true", L'homme replied with a certain amount of remorse in his voice.
219  Well...Let's see what we can do for you.", Piper said. "All may not be lost
220  et. I think this adventure will be long and arduous. We can't let a little

283        From the swirling eddys of his unconscious mind the picture framed
284  tself with almost painful crispness. A moment in time so perfectly captured,
285  o infinite in detail, he awoke startled. The smell and taste of the sea
286  trong in his senses. Proping himself up on one arm he tried to remember the
287  hought that had already begun to fade from his mind. He had been at sea,
288  t dawn, closing his eyes he could hear the creak of the rudderpost as he 
289  uided the craft over the swells. Bearing off as he went into the trough of
290  ach wave and stiffning up as he reached the crest. The luff of the sails as 
291  he cycle repeated itself. A dry ship he thought to himself. 
292        Now fully awake he turned his eyes east, watching the morning light 
293  ilter through the trees to his campsite. Listening to the brook that ran 
294  earby he felt thirst. Taking the first swallow from his canteen he could 
295  lmost taste the faint remains of coffee on his palate. Strange he thought,
296  e had forsaken that drink for a far more palatable brew years ago. Yet the
297  aste somehow pleased him. 
298        His route lay to the west. At least he thought as far as the bridge he
299  ad seen from his refuge on the mountain so long ago. Raising his rucksack to
300  is back he began to follow the trace of the stream. The rowan staff leading 
301  nd feet following. His greatcoat still held the treasures the river had
302  ielded. Reaching his free hand into the pocket he aimlessly palmed the 
303  atin ribbon.  I can be there by nightfall he thought. Falling into his
304  rregular gait his thoughts turned to the dream.

341  Bard called Lucifer's attention to Piper's landing beyond a rise. They
342  rotted into a convenient shadow...
343  ... and tout of one near Piper and L'homme(!).
344  After being brought up to date on L'homme's situation, bard spoke, "I
345  hink I can solve your transport difficulties. I do hope that YOU don't get
346  irsick!"
347  Bard began to sing... an old Steely Dan song...
348  "I'm going to fly like an eagle...."
349  "I'm going to fly like an eagle...."
350  As the others stared at him in puzzlement a sound as of beating wings
351  as heard. A LARGE hawk-like creature made made a landing (blowing over the
352  ent in the process).
353  "L'homme meet Ubar, Ubar- L'homme." Bard introduced L'homme to the
354  arn.

356  PELLCECK: I'm curious, what were the errors? I know I left an 'm' out of
357  remembering' but *I* count that as a typo. (YOU would!)
358  ikey: howcum BW sometimes echo too few (or rarely, too MANY) bacspaces? If I
359  end a stream of them (to erase back to an error) there is about a 25% chance
360  fthis occurring.
361  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

371  ikey: It would appaer that most of MY last entry was removed! I hope it
372  s recoverable. If I find out that this was a TWIT attack & the entry is
373  on-recoverable....
374  ... well, let's just say that the results would NOT be pretty. 
375  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
376  ********************************************************::
377  ard: BWMS doesn't handle backing up over control characters at all well,
378  his is because the backspace was patched in much later. It use to only
379  se the Rubout (Delete) character. The problem is that the backspace will
380  ot check the character it is going back over, thus since it is non visable
381  t will erase the previous character that just happens to be on the screen.
382  lso of course, if you are printing with CC N it only erases half of the
383  ontrol character since it doesn't know about the preceeding '^'. It's all
384  uite messy really.
385  o person asking about the missing lines, it is simple, someone erased them.
386  gain to Bard: Are the missing lines in question the ones you are referring to?
387  f so, they can be recovered, but I don't have the equipment to do so here.
388  It requires that I take the disk to work and undelete the sectors under a
389  ebugger on my cpm system.) Even recovered, it has the disadvantage of 
390  oosing the first character of each line. This crazy system writes a FF to
391  he first character posistion to indicate that the line was deleted.
392  o spell check: It looks like I'm holding about even. Yawn.....
393  ard one final time: Do you want me to try to recover it? It will take a
394  ay or so to do it, including removing this disk from BWMS to take it to
395  ork to do the cleaning, but it can be done. (Maybe someone else has a
396  ownloaded copy they can upload back?)

399   pased tha spel chek.  How nice.  Mikey, I think the Chaos resulting from this disk being removed would exceed the 
400  haos of those lines being missing.  Hopefully someone can upload.
401  ++++++++++++++
402  s Milchar recovered from the strain of spell-casting, he decided to go and eat the wonderful meal prepared by the 
403  riar.  He worried more and more about the attack, and grew quite anxious.  He wondered where Piper and Bard had gone
404  ff to.  A quick mind-scan didn't helpmatters any.  Restless, Milchar began working on a Key for the Nor-gate.
405  e went to his pack and drew out a small golden-colored ball of metal.  Humming to himself, Milchar molded it like 
406  lay into the form of a  small staff.  "Ball of Clay, as I go, enlarge, lengthen, harden, grow!", Milchar said.  An
407  rgent glow enveloped the ball, ate at it, tore at its fiber.  In a chaotic display of color, the ball grew and formed
408  tself into a finely made staff.  "Not my best work, but it will have to do... it only has to last for a little while."
409  ith that, Milchar went to his tent to sleep.
410  +++++++++++
411  Hargo, are you ready yet??", Narfaal snapped.  He was irritated after his best Manticore had been shrunk by a third-
412  lass mage.
413  Everything is prepared, Master.  There are Vesta-Cannons stationed at four points along the perimeter.  Their range is
414  ore than enough to reach the gate."
415  Excellent.  I wish revenge.  Hate must have a victim, Hargo.  I hate always.  Remember that."
416  Yes, Master.  You always hate."

419  n added thought, is anyone interested in rewriting BWMS? Hopefully to
420  orrect some of the deficiences that many out there have noticed.
421  E, protection for already stored messages, improved editing such as
422  ultiple line delete of your own message, ect..
423  imitations: BWMS uses 2708 EPROMs, and I have no way to burn them.
424  here is only 8K of PROM space available for the program. Currentlu
425  here is only 1K of RAM storrage, though I can increase it if need be.
426  WMS uses an 8080A processor, 8251 USARTS, and a 1771 disk controler.
427  nyone interested in an impossible project? Oh yes, I don't have a
428  isting of the existing code, I do have some scraps and pieces and

445    The piper quickly helped L'Homme Sans Parity break his camp and roll his 
446  elongings into a compact package.  After lashing the package to the back of
447  he Pegasus, L'Homme and the piper mounted the winged horse-like creature.
448  he takeoff had a few moments of rather extreme concern.  Both the piper and
449  'Homme expressed some rather improbable juxatpositions of anatomical wonders
450  nd invented several new prayers to, as yet, unheard of gods.  As they rose
451  lowly, the piper turned his head and spoke to L'Homme.
452    "How do you like this transportation?" Suddenly they felt a *bump* and the 
453  andscape seemed to melt beneath them and crawl into a new configuration
454  efore freezing in place.  The piper clipped off an oath.  They had the party
455  n sight, the odor of dinner in their nostrils and all had changed.  Where
456  he party had stood, sat, and layed, a group of stones and stumps with one
457  r two fallen logs formed a clearing in a forest.
458   "Hang on!"  The piper guided their heavily laden steed in a tight circle,
459  hen retraced their path through the sky.  They felt another *bump* and the
460  andscape crawled back into its previous configuration.
461   "I've known about air pockets," the piper remarked to L'Homme after a 
462  un-filled landing, "but don't know just what that last little experience
463  as.  Perhaps we have discovered a new phenomenon -- the reality pocket."
464   The two men quickly unloaded the steed, and walked over to join the others
465  n their dinner.  The piper called to the rest, "L'Homme has returned and 
466  ould like to join us on the trip to the Ruby Valley!  He needs transportation
467  s he has been separated from his vehicle, and that would not be useable on
468  his trip -- Milchar could strain something trying to move an inanimate object
469  f that size through the realities.  We need a living creature for him to ride."

589  8-145 are missing also.  I don't know what all was lost, but I did see
590  hat the beginning of Reluctant Voyager's entry is missing.
591   am willing to help (Leonard) with re-writing BWMS.  I'm pretty good at
592  -80, and 8080 is just a step down from there.   As far as what to include
593  n a new version, I'll have to ponder that a while.  Generally, I like the
594  ay it is -- nice and simple.  Some sort of message protection would
595  e nice, though.  As I said, a subject to think about.
596  'homme: had them remove the old chip and put in the new.  Absolutely
597  O difference.  Either the other chip is the problem, or...?
598  Now I wish I had had him replace both, since I had them both.  Didn't think
599  f it until I found out the problem was still there.  Sigh...
600   new computer sounds better and better...)

603  o Dawn:  Why does this board have to be like all of the rest?  Why can't
604  eople be individuals and show thier creativity?  I bet you wouldn't mind
605  eeing this turn into a NetWorks program, your just that type of person,
606  ne of them.  This is the only board left were you can be creative and talk
607  bout a wide variety of things.  I think it is great that this board is still
608  unning after such a time.

611  L'homme, my good friend!  It has indeed been a long time!  I'm afraid that trying to move your car here would send
612  e into a coma.  I'm willing to let you ride behind me on Drinny, if you like.  He won't mind."
613  ith that, Milchar helped break camp and saddled Drinny up.  Someone had found a horse for L'homme (borrowed?), so 
614  is offer was needless.  The party continued on its journey.
615  he country surrounding them sapped their strength to look at it, dreary and grey.  The horses began to move faster on
616  heir own, as if knowing something the humans didn't.  At this new pace, the flats were soon left behind and they began
617  o climb the foothills.
618  The Nor-Gate is on the south slope of this mountain.  It is not far now, only a few minutes.  And just in time, too, 
619  t is due to open in about a half of an hour.  All ready?  Let us go!"
