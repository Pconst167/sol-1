23 Wow !  What manner of wierdness.  Cistop Mikey, does the system have gas,
24 It seems to be generating volumes these days.
25 
26 A few comments on DB.  (Drive B, not the parachutist)
27 
28 True American - After reading Alas Babylon, perhaps you might be interested
29 in a possible alternative.  I suggest 'Level 7'.  It is at any good used
30 bookstore.  Sorry, but hte author escapes me at the present.  This seems
31 to be a little more up to date than Babylon, which offered some false ray
32 of hope.
33 
34 Brandon Cave - I really enjoyed your satire.  Such biting commentary is a 
35 pleasure to read, and one of the hallmarks of BWMS.
36 
37 A possible equation for all of your interest:
38 
39 SKATER DUDE = BUFFY = ORVILLE PRENTICE = SAMOAN
40 
41 I know that you had all noticed, but I thought someone should print it out
42 in the unmistakeable caps.
43 
44 As to my message to Cistop Mikey, I should clarify that I enjoy wierdness,
45 especially as this seems to stay at least a little above twitness.
46 
47 So saying, I sat back down at my table and poured myself and the Bartender
48 another stiff B&B, the nectar provided by the Gods.

131 Following the end of World War Two a pervasive cynicism swept
132 Europe that lead to the rise of German Existentialism.
133 
134 Philosophic Superstars like Neitzsche, Schopenhaur, and
135 Kierkegaard spread their nihilistic doctrines of hopelessness
136 and dispair through what was left of war torn Europe.
137 
138 Wide spread cynicism grasped the hearts of peasants and nobility
139 a like. "WHO CARES?" became the symbol of their pent up angers
140 and frustration. Almost immediately it was scratched among the
141 graffitti in restrooms from England to Greece. In every
142 language, in every country, it was etched in angry protest of
143 the irrelevancy of the post war world.
144 
145 In the early seventies, during the depths of the Watergate
146 morass, the "WHO CARphenomenon hit America.
147 
148 It started quietly in the restrooms of colleges in the East.
149 "WHO CARES?" graffitti soon spread to bathrooms all across the
150 nation. It was, of course, most prevalent and fanatic in the
151 toilets of Princeton, Bennington, and Yale.
152 
153 In 1986 the movement went electronic. The Cynical nihilism of
154 the "WHO CARES?" cult soon spread to bulletin boards across the
155 nation. The world was bombarded with this message of univeral
156 dispair.
157 
158 It began to destroy the moral fabric of our nation. President
159 Reagan attempted to fight the infection with the most effective
160 weapon in his arsonal, humor. Not even his sure thing "There
161 must be a pony in here somewhere" story was enough to turn
162 the tide of cynicism that grasped the hearts of America.
163 
164 It has become so bad that people won't even belie
165 President's "Iranian money and the Contra Hero" story. And it
166 is a wonderful story. It has a John Wayne sort of hero, lots
167 of action, and a delightfully imaginative story line.
168 
169 But nobody will believe it. All they do is listlessly sit around
170 and ask "WHO CARES?".
171 
172 The President is thinking of calling a Press Conference.

211 And there came a time to the land when the sky was bleak. Hungry children stood
212 in the street, wondering if there would ever be a next meal. Parents long dead
213 lay unburied next to the remnants of homesteads. A rusty sky cast eerie long
214 dark shadows from the tomb stones of these lucky enough to die before the
215 embargo.
216 
217 Yes, the embargo. This, the third one in ten years. Each time before, broken.
218 Now this, the longest, sees no end save the death of all. Then the embargo
219 would be a useless waste of space power, and the ships responsible would
220 vanish to an uncomprehensible netherworld.
221 
222 A lone sliver ship streaks across the sky. Too small and too fast to be
223 intercepted by the big frigates, it descends to the planet's surface near
224 one of the major population centers. The ship
225 lands, gyro-controlled rockets vaporizing broken buildings and human bones
226 below. The outer shell glows pink as a door on the leading edge of the ship
227 opens and a figure peers out. Steps appear from a recess under the hatch,
228 and the figure mounts the steps and moves towards the ground. Setting foot
229 on the charred surface, the figure kneels and through the darkened face
230 plate kisses the ground. The act soils the knees and helmet of the environ
231 suit, but the figure does not seem to notice the stains.
232 
233 Walking towards the setting suns, and the more highly constructed buildings
234 of the village, the figure casts long shadows that in moments out-distance
235 the slim shadow of the sliver ship.
236 
237 Old eyes follow the progression of the figure. Children aged beyond their
238 years scurry as the stranger approaches the outlying buildings. Mounds of
239 human remains attract the attention of the sliver ship pilot. A glint at
240 the base of the pile reflects setting sunlight in the visor of the suit.
241 The visitor changes direction, heading towards the glinty object.
242 
243 Kneeling at the base of the pile of bodies, the visor reflects the tragedy
244 and abject horror of the death of the planet. Months and years of decay
245 fill the atmosphere with the sick smell of death. Cool, purified, refined
246 air courses through the nostrils of a witness to a social plague.
247 
248 A gloved hand picks up the shiny metal object. Mollychromite case that
249 never dents or tarnishes. A vanity case. The case is opened, the mirror
250 intact reflects the dark, electronically enhanced visor. Ampules of perfume
251 and coloring ring a powder depository. The contents are in perfect 
252 condition. A high quality case protects its contents.
253 
254 The stranger closes the case. Neural connectors transmit chemical messages
255 derived from electronic devices. Sounds from behind the stranger cause him
256 to turn in place from the heaping grave and scan the street.
257 
258 Children beside and above watch silently as a stranger walks towards another
259 building. Instinct keeps them hidden, for now.

266 He shakes his head in silent bemusement, a slight smile lifting the
267 edges of his mouth, followed by a small sigh. The grafity was slightly
268 more heavy than usual. The usual stuff, plus someone who thinks he
269 can change the world by scribling "who cares" all over everything,
270 not even realizing that like the overzelous religous zealots who 
271 scrible "trust Jesus" all over anything that presents a reasonably
272 flat surface to write on, most people just ignore it, maybe shake
273 their head and wonder at why someone would deface the beauty of the
274 wall, box, or other surface with such things. In most cases they are
275 expressing their own fears, screaming out to the world what they 
276 themselves fear. The "Jesus freak" must scrible on the wall because 
277 he doesn't really believe. He doesn't believe because there are those
278 out there who don't believe what he feels he is supposed to believe,
279 so by trying to force the rest of the world to wear his belief structure
280 he mistakenly thinks that he can become secure in his own belief. 
281 WHich of course is a mistake. You don't create a belief in something
282 in your own mind by forcing others to believe the way you do. (Most
283 people will ignore you anyway, though some might punch you in the nose
284 if you become to obnoxiuos.) Belief comes from inside, belief is something
285 that you know to be true not because someone else thinks so, but because
286 you know it to be so. If you feel you must convert someone else, you
287 are expressing your own fear in your lack of belief, hopeing
288 that you can prove to yourself that it is true because the other
289 person believes in it as well. That is not belief, it is but a 
290 desire to belong, to be right, to be a part of 'the group', and is
291 derived from the fear of not being any of those. Some people join
292 a group to be "in" and have companions (nothing wrong with that if
293 you keep it in perspective) while others try to collect groups 
294 about them again so they can be "in". There is nothing wrong with
295 that either. No one is responsible for the actions of any other 
296 individual. They are however responsible for their own actions.
297 There is nothing wrong with expressing your belief by putting
298 a bumper sticker on your care, or even spray painting a slogan
299 on the side of your car. It is your property to do with as you
300 please. But when an individual expresses themselves in that maner
301 by defacing anothers property or the public's without permission
302 they have stepped over the line they are now interferring with the
303 rights of another. There is no justification in that act. It is
304 an act of agression. Might is not right. Agression/defense, strong/
305 weak have nothing to do with right or wrong. Right and wrong are
306 that which is defined by the society as a whole. In the USA right
307 is doing what you want as long as it does not impead upon others
308 rights. Wrong is to impead those rights. That holds true for every
309 indivdual in the country. Including the president. Unless society
310 has given another the expressed right to impead a specific right,
311 they do not have the legal nor the moral right to do so, and are
312 subject to the penalties as defined by the laws of that society.

330  The stranger examines the rubble of what once must have been the house of
331 a very rich family, the wood door, broken and twisted from an unreconizable
332 force, the walls split open and smoldering with short dead fire. Rummaging 
333 throughout the debris of, at one time, highly valuble smoke damaged furnature,
334 he hears a faint muffled whimper off in the corner. A cry acutlly is more the
335 word for it. He listens, 'h-h-help m-me'it says. Jumping up he runs over to a
336 pile of roofing and tiles, the sounds appears to be coming from here.'h-h-he-
337 lp-help m-me p-pl-p-please h-help'
338  "Its ok," the stranger whispers as he digs through the debris. Finally, a face

491 Emu - Yeah.
492 
493 Innkeeper - Your soliloquy was well written, and almost the last intelligable
494 item on the board.  I must however, disagree with a small part of it.  To wit-
495 'Right and Wrong is that which society has determined ...'
496 I think that right and wrong have some absolutes, although I do not know what 
497 they might be.
498 As an example, I offer you slavery.  200 years ago, society in the southern
499 United States determined that slavery was right.  Now we have determined
500 that it is wrong.  Are right and wrong imutable, or are they whimsical ?
501 Maybe truth is not changeable.  I am not sure what the answers are, and this 
502 seems to no longer be the forum to discuss it.  Sigh.
503 I do agree with your premise of violation of others rights.  
504 How do you feel about awarding $$$$ to people because they jerked their
505 kids out of school because they didn't like some books ?  I find that to
506 be one of the more ludicrous items going on to day, and potentialy much more
507 dangerous than secret arms deals.  My feelings on books are that knowledge in
508 books can not harm anyone who has a basis of self to fall back on.
509 Sorry this seems a little disjointed, but the preceeding 350 lines rather
510 stunned me.

543  Inkeeper, I have a comment about your LONG typed thing on WHO CARES?
544  You said that if someone spraypainted something on the side of their car its all 
545 right because its their property and it dose'nt involve the rights of others. Well,
546 what if they had happened to spray on bad words, cussing everything and one out?
547  That is a violationg of other peoples rights to have to see trash like that. Or if
548 that certian someone placed a HUGE speaker system up on top of their car and played
549 this Death Metal crapola while driving in a residential area. Is'nt that a violation
550 of rights? Well, same with the WHO CARES? As long as no one takes it too far, I
551 see it as a tension breaker. The first
552 time that I logged on here I was reading the messages and there awas this REAL 
553 serious and REAL long one, it really depressed me, than I saw the WHO CARES? after
554 it and I almost bit my tounge laughing.  As for T O M. Keep it to yourself jack. 
555  As you may not be able to notice, some people LIKE to write strange things on 
556 this system and LIKE to....(uh oh, can you say...)...FUN! (I knew you could)
557  So next time you have a comment about a 'stupid' message, recheck that track in your
558 brain, 37 and rewrite sector 3. OK?
559  By the way, it was'nt Delerious that wrote the zz lyrics, it was........

566 	Right, so when a person shares a part of their life, partly as
567 therapy, partly to give them another thing to do than wrack their brains
568 out, it's just fine to make fun of them and what they've done?
569 	No. I don't buy it.
570 	If you want be humorous, there are any number of ways you can do
571 it within your own entries. You don't have to capitalize on the fact that
572 one line can make a complete mockery of three days of crying, and typing
573 when she wont answer the phone.
574 	Give it up. The entire Who Cares thing has been overdone. It is
575 too annoying to see every thirty lines, and it is too cruel to practically
576 ruin someone else's entry. I like the German Existentialismic ideas on here.
577 Good parody. Incisive style. Sharp references to German supremicist thought
578 and hatred for the idealist.
579 	But its a really nasty thing to do to some people's entries, and
580 to waste so much time and effort on the annoying markers.

588 BACK WHEN I WAS PREPUBESCENT (9 MONTHS AGO) I WAS SHOWING
589 MY TALENT ON THE ICE (THUS, MY NAME).  ALL THE SUDDEN
590 THE ICE BECAME WEAK.  BEFORE I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING DOWN,
591 I WAS.  OXYGEN DEPREVATION.  THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.
592 I WAS UNDER FOR A GOOD 25 MINUTES.  THIS DUDE IS A
593 REMNENT OF WHAT HE WAS.

619 Well  except for a few well needed entries, I'd say that my cosin has finally
620 gotten a modem (she talks like most of the people currently entering messages,
621 and you can guess what that's like).  This is what I return to Portland for?
622 I'm tempted to return to Tacoma, wasteland of america.   At least it
623 has not progressed too far.   Santa:  I just want to say the coal was not very
624 funny.  Yes, last year I REALLY did get coal in my stocking.  It was quite
625 upsetting to say the least.  I hope there will be more discussion on the
626 nuclear war issue (or any war issue).  I really don't have anything to add on
627 it at this time, but I enjoy the entries just the same.  
628 Well, we'll see what happens to this board now............
629 	          Fast Fred,    BSAL (Ret.)      @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  I have returned!!!
