23 Jonathan Chance: I suggest you study the situation more carefully, an Ogre vs a
24 Bolo is no contest. The Bolo will take minor damage, while the Ogre gets wasted!
25 Please note that a MK IV Bolo (Continental Siege Unit) has a .5 Megaton/sec 
26 firepower and can withstand anything short of a direct hit by a nuclear warhead.
27 The later model Bolo's make it even more of an uneven contest.

29 d:I believe that the original intention was to find out why all these weapons
30 were being brought to the inn. Unfortunately, things got out of hand....
31 As for the apprentice passing out, I believe he was using something known
32 as a "reality pill" (see The Butterfly Kid by Chester Anderson, for details 
33 about these pills.)(I believe you might enjoy the book!) 
34 Briefly, they are a form of hallucinogen with the notable property that
35 your hallucinations are real! With practice, some control is possible - however 
36 there is still a tendency to slip into the "wow! look at that...." state.

38 Oh GOD! He went & DID it! was Kenin's first coherent thought. Looking around
39 he decide that they were safe for the moment.
40 Taking a second, more careful look he saw:
41 The piper apparently repairing some damage to his pipes.
42 The Ninja lying on his stomach (& no doubt wondering what had happened to the VW!)
43 The apprentice lying in the grass with a blissful look on his face.
44 The traveller, also taking stock of the situation.
45 The Man in Grey & FOTI arguing about whether or not any of this had REALLY happened!
46 Several strangers.
47 And ....
48 "Hello, Freddie" he said as he grabbed the Bolo dealer's arm. "Why don't we
49 have a nice LOOONG chat? Hmmmmm?"
50 As he finished, he noticed that the person with whom Freddie had been talking
51 was doing a fast fade. Too late, he realized that the familiar face had been 
52 McKane.
53 Oh well, maybe next time...

59 The Tavern Song (by Baldwin of Erebor)
60 There was a jolly Prince,
61 In the tavern.
62 There was a jolly Prince
63 To the tavern he did go.
64 He'd pitch his woo with grace and pow'r
65 To someone different every hour.
66 There's nothing can compare with the tavern,
67 So the tavern is the place to stay.
68 
69 A travelling bard came in,
70 To the tavern.
71 A travelling bard came in,
72 To the tavern he did go.
73 He ordered up a pot of stout,
74 And played his harpstrings out.
75 There's nothing can compare with the tavern,
76 So the tavern is the place to stay.
77 
78 (following lines are compressed to save space, expand as above)
79 A knight came riding up
80 He jousted a butt of sack
81 So strong it laid him on his back
82 
83 There was a saucy wench
84 She'd serve you once upon her feet
85 And then again between the sheets
86 
87 There was a humble squire
88 He bade his master come and sit
89 Then went to make a knight of it
90 
91 There was a pretty page
92 The wenches thought, "What endless joy;
93 A pity that he's still a boy."
94 
95 A weaver did come in
96 He drank away a pot of ale
97 And wove us all a merry tale
98 
99 A fop came mincing in
100 The wenches thought him rather odd
101 I don't think I'll complete this verse....
102 
103 There was a mighty dwarf
104 He gave us of his hard-won gold
105 For ale and a wench to hold
106 
107 A 'prentice did come in
108 He ordered up one past his eight
109 And ended in a sorry state
110 
111 A monger then came in
112 She ordered with a monger's call
113 And scared the patrons from the hall!
114 
115 A Welshman did come in
116 He won himself tremendous fame
117 Because he could pronounce his name
118 
119 It's time we started home
120 So pledge me in a bowl I pray,
121 And wish me health in every way.

135 Dear Mr. Wassir:
136 
137 Mr. Lawrence Henderson, of the Central Intelligence Agency, 
138 has brought some irregularities in your tax statement to the 
139 attention of the Internal Revenue Service.
140 
141 Your attempts to write off your Latin American war debts are 
142 not acceptable under US tax law. We, at the IRS, are saddened 
143 to learn that Ecuadorian saboteurs destroyed your railroad 
144 bridge. Unfortunately, we can not allow you to deduct this as 
145 a transportation cost.
146 
147 Also, war damage can not be written off as depreciation 
148 allowance and income from hostages is taxable income.
149 
150 Your revised tax bill now stands at $6,597,201.37. Please 
151 contact Mr. d'Autun at our Portland office to arrange 
152 payment.

158 Dear Monsieur d'Autun;
159       Call off the dogs!  I'm just a humble Albanian Freedom Fighter trying
160 to make a living.  I know you have something dangerous up your sleeve for
161 me.  It seems I have no choice but to take your assignment, whatever it is.
162      Enclosed you will find several Polaroids of the BOLO's that I destroyed
163 at Fast Fred's.  I used Pershing missles, I hope that isn't cheating.  
164 Salazar says the Egg is worth somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 million.
165 Hmmmm.... that might just cover my tax bill.  Anyway, I'll do what you
166 want.  I have a sinking feeling in my gut that McKane's wrapped up in this
167 somehow.
168       My terms are write-off of the tax bill.  A lifetime exclusion from
169 paying any more income taxes, and $200,000 in gold bullion.  Also have
170 a Mark V BOLO at my disposal that (ahem) followed me home.

196 Dear Lieutenant;
197      I know much about Natasha's death.  What it boils down to, was that
198 she was murdered by Leroy McKane.  I'm still a little hazy on his reasons,
199 but McKane's an enigma anyway.  While not actively seeking McKane, if he
200 crosses my path, I'll blow him away. (That dirty scum)
201       Hope you have a nice day.
202                                         A. Salazar
203 P.S.  You wouldn't know anything about the disappearance of the Phoenix's
204 Egg?  I might be able to dig up a little more on McKane to trade for some
205 information

209 Leroy;
210      I'm leaving this message in our secondary drop location since our
211 primary drop (the BOLO lot ) has been comprimised.  Some heavy dudes are
212 prowling around this area.  The CIA, IRS, and God knows who else are putting
213 the pressure on me to do a job for them.  A gentlemen named d'Autun is
214 my contact.  Name sound familiar?  
215       Also talked to Salazar, he said Interpol is digging for information
216 on you.  Something big is going down.  Salazar is still jerked about Natasha
217 He's tied up right now on the case of the Phoenix's Egg, but would like
218 to take you out if you get the chance.  About the Egg, I heard from a
219 wizard friend of mine that it's magical.  Something about its owner 
220 being able to control the power of the ages.  If you run across it, let
221 me know.  We may be able to cut a deal.

240 were thrown away due to a need for avalible life-force.

314 enough to be drugged, nearly kill himself bashing through miles of dark 
315 forest, be shot at by arms small and large, and nearly blown up by an

355 The piper had the drones, chanter, and blowpipe completely removed from the
356 bag of his instrument.  He had a length of yellow hemp cord tied around a 
357 stick held away by his feet, wrapped several times around one of the wooden
358 tubes tied into the bag, and wrapped around a stick held in his right hand.
359 He was rolling the stock (wooden tube) and bag back and forth with all the 
360 tension his strength would allow, seating the leather of the bag into a groove
361 in the base of the stock.  Feeling it set in the groove, he added several more
362 turns of cord, working each down under great tension.  Finally tying off the
363 cord, he drew 4 corks from his sporran.  He put the blowpipe into its stock,
364 then plugged the chanter and drone stocks with the corks, then blew the bag
365 up till it was firm to the touch.
366   "There, let's see how that holds." he muttered to himself, then looked 
367 around.  The apprentice was still blissfully unconcous, a smile on his lips
368 and vagrant wisps of brilliant color drifting from his aura.  The best thing
369 for him was a rest after that effort.  The bard was sitting a ways from the
370 rest looking into space.  The piper walked over to him and asked, "How did
371 that quick look get turned into a full-scale firefight?"  He sat down and 
372 pulled a bottle and some glasses from his sporran.
373   "Here, you look like you could use a bracer.  This is Laphroige, another 
374 single malt."  He poured them each a drink and put the bottle away.
375   "I found that the apprentice and I could just barely keep several of us
376 together when moving through realities on the pipes.  Congratulations on your
377 work together in getting the last mess cleaned up as well as you did.  It was
378 well done to consult on that particular episode, although the apprentice looks
379 like he will be out of action for a while.  Are you going to participate in
380 any more (hopefully non-violent) attempts to do whatever it is we were going
381 to do?"  The piper sat silent for a time.  "Sad to say, I can't really remember
382 just what was going on.  I was headed to find the wizard (but don't remember
383 why) while you folks were looking into the connection between the used BOLOs
384 and the hairy fishnuts.  What did we hope to accomplish?  How?  What next?"
385   He walked over to his pipes, and checked the bag.  It was still firm, so
386 he removed the corks and replaced the chanter and drones in their stocks. 
387 Hearing silvery laughter, he turned and saw a slight figure moving toward
388 the party.  Smiling, he made a bow and began playing "The Fair Maid of 
389 Glendaurel", the pipes singing sweetly in the bright spring air.

402 In reviewing your tax records we have discovered that you have

429 chance. It's been entertaining to watch your flundering efforts, but as the
430 King's appointed representative in this party I've got to say YOU'D BETTER
431 GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. Now that d is joining us I hope we'll see a little 
432 sense here. Now let's get going before the trail gets too cold.

436 Dear friends, I must correct an erroneous assumption that most of
437  you have made. We are NOT in the BOLO lot. I am not certain where we are as the
438 piper was handling that end of things. A summary of events (as well as I can 
439 recall them) follows.
440 IMPRIMUS: I transformed the bullets and weapons.
441 SECUNDUS: I shifted the Bolos to another reality (I *thought* I got the VW too, 
442 but I will have to ask the Ninja for confirmation)
443 TERTIUS: I "grabbed" all the involved parties so that they would accompany us to
444 our destination. (Remember, piper was holding us where the lot could
445 be seen, but we were "out of phase", so the gunfire didn't affect us.)
446 QUARTUS: I *attempted to repair the damage. (It may have come to thy notice that
447 my control was slipping badly by this time)
448 QUINTUS: I lost conciousness.
449 
450 I had assumed that the piper would have shifted us elsewhere, if only 
451 to avoid the authorities (who are, no doubt, swarming over the scene even as we
452 speak).
453 I hope to regain conciousness soon, but in the meantime be prepared for
454 minor manifestations of whimsy.
455 
456 Ninja: If I *did* move the VW, you are in a rather strange reality where the VW
457 has rights as a citizen. You are also in about the 25th (or was it 30th?) 
458 century AD.

471 We regret that our original msg was slightly garbled. As you know we will be
472 recovering from the effects of the Fracture for at least 4 or 5 more years.
473 
474 Our information on the subject (Kenin Lirison aka BARD) is somewhat sketchy. He
475 has been reported on many of our lines. He is known to have claimed NEMSEC 
476 status in several cases. We are unable to confirm this due to the many records
477 lost in the accident. His abilities would seem to suggest at least level 4 
478 training.
479 
480 If he is one of our personnel, he may not be aware that recovery efforts are 
481 being made. However he is making use of Alternities equipment if rumor can be
482 relied upon. How much and of what type is unknown.
483 
484 He is not unduly aggressive, but all reports indicate that EXTREME CAUTION is 
485 advisable when dealing with him on an adversary basis.

555 JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. WHERE DID THEY GO? OH, WELL, I GUESS I MUST REPORT THIS
556 TO THE OLD MAN.
557 ...............
558 GREAT! I GET STUCK WITH INVESTIGATING THIS SCREWED UP WORLD WHEN I SHOULD BE

560 HMM.."NAME:TERRA  TECHNOLOGY LEVEL:PRIMITAVE NUCLEAR. UNEXPLORED. LAST CHECK
561 MADE ON 19934." THAT WAS ONLY 12 YEARS AGO. THEY COULDN'T HAVE DEVELOPED MESON
562 WEAPONS IN THAT SHORT OF A TIME. I GUESS I MUST INVESTIGATE. MORE TIME WASTED!
563 ..........
564 LOG ENTRY: HAVE LANDED IN AN AREA HICH SENSORS REPORT TO BE THE FOCUS OF THE
565 DISTURBANCE.  APPEARS TO BE PRIMITAVE. ONLY HAND WEAPONS, NO FIREARMS!
566 THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! ATMOSPHERE CHECKS OUT OK, SO I WILL GO OUT AND TRY TO
567 COMMUNICATE. I SHALL TAKE MY BLASTER TO INSURE MY SAFETY, AS THOSE TOADSTICKERS
568 CAN STILL BE DEADLY.

591 Sir, from whence come you?" The Poet turned an inquisitive eye to the 
592 gentleman in the silve suit who'd just appeared in their midst.
593 "Well, I'm originally from the agriworld of K'n'ssas," the stranger began.
594 "Well, you're not in K'n'ssas anymore," snapped The Poet, "so stand back, 
595 we've got work to do here. Piper, what did the Wizard have to say?"
596 "We never got that far. We were testing the pipes' limits, but realized
597 your trouble and went to save your lives before we got there."
