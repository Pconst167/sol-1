 54 Welcome to a new disk ladies and gentlemen. I've heard rumers of elves in
 55 the basement of the Inn. Are they mischivios?

 57 Someday I'll be a level one user. Till then I must meerly dream.
 58  
 59 End of ramblings. 
 60  
 61 On a semi-seriose note, I think I'll start writting more about the Inn. I
 62 have been learning more and more about it. The history of Backwater is 
 63 fascinating. I almost feel like I'm violating some sort of trust when
 64 I look through the Archives. 
 65  
 66 I know that Friar has been here on and off for atleast 4 years. I know
 67 from whom and when Milchar got his bread board. I know when emu 
 68 graduated. And when such people as Green Eyes, Piper, Delta V and
 69 many other came or left the Inn.
 70  
 71 I am currently easing up on the final days of BWMS I. Soon I will have
 72 read up to them time I first entered the Inn. Then I will go to the 
 73 begining and take in the early years.

 96 Well AD, I think I am flattered not to be old, but I haven't ridden off into
 97 the sunset, just have little to say these days.  I think a lot of what you 
 98 consider to be old timers are about the same age, and are in the same mode at
 99 their chosen careers.  A lot of responsibility, too little time, so work hard 
100 and smart.  Leaves little time for the creative juices to flow.
101 I would still like to get a multi-authored story going, or a game of modem
102 risk.  But for either, you need about six steady participants.
103 Just my two cents worth.

106 Friar, that was worth more than two cents! What do you mean a milti-authored
107 story? Is that where someone starts a story, then leaves the end open for
108 others to continue? Sounds fun. Seen it before on some other boards but it's
109 usually stupid. I'm here still... there's about 5 or so regulars now. So
110 AD, how are you doing? I'm pretty good. Hope everything is going well with

134    The multi-author stories are perhaps the best thing ever developed on
135 these dancing phosphors- and yes, one person would start, develop the
136 story a little, and usually leave the next person with a puzzle to solve
137 or danger to avoid.  When writing such a story, you may use the
138 characters of other authors, but with care.  Don't kill them off because
139 of a freak earthquake or lightning bolt.  Usually the authors need to have
140 another mode of communication so that a few plot details can be agreed
141 upon.  Such stories have direction and the creative energies of many
142 people, and are often the most interesting.
143    Past examples of multi-author stories include the Kol-um-bee-a adventure,
144 the Ruby Valley adventure, and any of the NET stories.

166 Milch, thanks for explaining the multi-authored story concept to me. I
167 would probably just be a spectator, however, and not join in because my
168 skills of writing are rather lame to say the least. But, if I see a neat
169 something I could add, then I just might do that. I'm not familiar with
170 these NET stories that you speak of AD. Hmm or this cyberish stuff.

188                          PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND DAY
189 We invite interested organizations to help us dedicate April 23, 1989 to 
190 Prince William Sound by planning activities meaningful and relevant to the 
191 members of the organization and the community participating to help us bring 
192 to mind the effects of our everyday choices. 
193 Following is a copy of the proclamation drafted by the Prince William Sound 
194 Day Steering Committee.  Please copy it and pass it on if you can, we are 
195 hoping for a groundswell.  We are looking for both organizational and 
196 individual signators.  We hope to encourage as wide a range of participation 
197 as possible, on as many different levels as feasible.  If possible, please 
198 return, or ask for the return of, the petitions by April 20 to: 
199                 Prince William Sound Day Organizing Committee

202                 Anchorage, Alaska  99501
203 We would appreciate notification of institutional endorsements for our press 
204 releases, and we encourage local organizations to issue their own press 
205 releases expressing their own views, thoughts, and reflections upon this 
206 almost overwhelmingly tragic Alaskan ordeal.  Individuals who feel it 
207 appropriate could greatly aid in this effort with letters to the editor, and 
208 requests to local news media to reproduce the proclamation.  Copies would be 
209 appreciated, and photographs of group activities or artistic creations would 
210 be welcomed. Further information may be obtained by leaving a message for 
211 acfte in econet mail.  I am having difficulty getting onto the conferences, so 
212 please feel free to pass on this note to any and all interested parties, and 
213 to let us know how it goes.  This day is intended to be what the people who 
214 join us in the dedication of it make it. 
215 We in Alaska, who now add our tears to the fouled waters of the Sound, need to 
216 know that a more responsible future is possible.

225 setting aside time on April 23, 1989, to the remembrance of the Sound as it 
226 was, to the choices we have before us, and to the awareness of the

248 Following message is from EcoNet: Topic 270        Exxon oil spill - Alaska
249 1 response mstraube        en.energy         6:19 pm  Apr  4, 1989
250  
251          *********  AN OPEN LETTER TO ECONET USERS *********
252  
253 "On March 24, in the early morning hours, a disastrous  accident happened in 
254 the waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska.  By now you all know that [the] 
255 tanker. the Exxon Valdez, hit a submerged reef and lost 240,000 barrels of oil 
256 into the waters of the Sound." 
257  
258 So begins Exxon's "apology" to the public in the  newspapers.  We are 
259 disgusted at Exxon's actions, and are taking our own actions to make Exxon 
260 learn the error of their ways. 
261  
262 What did Exxon do?
263    
264  
265         o        First, they caused the largest and environ-
266                 mentally most significant oil spill in US history
267                 by putting a captain with a history of drunk
268                 driving in charge of a supertanker crossing some
269                 of the most dangerous and sensitive waters on
270                 earth.
271  
272         o        Then, they made the accident worse by taking almost
273                 two days even to begin to respond to the spill.
274                 Why?  They had systematically dismantled their oil
275                 spill response capability by dismissing 2/3 of its
276                 oil spill staff, and by having virtually no oil booms
277                 or other containment equipment available to respond
278                 to a spill.
279  
280         o        After causing this calamity, they then sought to
281                 reap a profit by stopping delivery under its fuel
282                 supply contracts using the incredible excuse that
283                 the spill was an "act of God", and by raising
284                 gasoline prices at the pumps!
285  
286         o        Finally, Exxon continues to insist that future oil
287                 and gas development in pristine areas like the
288                 Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Bristol Bay
289                 will have no impact on the environment.
290  
291 What are we doing to express our disgust and disappoint-
292 ment?
293  
294         o        boycotting Exxon gas stations
295         o        tearing up our Exxon credit card
296         o        sending it back, with an explanatory letter, to
297                 L.G. Rawl, Chairman of Exxon, P.O. Box 4298,

337      The Inn was quit, though ocasionally sounds could be heard from below.
338 It was rumored that tiny humenish like creatures lived down there. Some
339 people called them elves, though they probably wern't anything like what
340 most people thought of as elves.

346      The Wanderer sensed many other presences, but none were distinct. It
347 was as if many beings hovered around the Inn, observing.

349      He marked his place carefully and closed the book before him. Many names
350 had be written therein. The strange tome had the word "Archive" written
351 on the cover. He felt momentarily guilty about haveing looked inside, as
352 the book really wasn't his. 
353  
354      Though this thought gnawed at him, there was another that weighed more
355 heavily. The book had had the names of many people who had once been 
356 regulers at the Inn. Yet, now little or no sign could be found of them.

414     Hi. This is Theus. Yeah, Theus. Remember me? No? Darn.
415     I used to call Backwater and Tanis as well. I loved them for what they
416 were. Free sources of information interchange, the whole nine yards. I learned
417 to type at 300 baud, calling BWMS I every night, trying to get through the
418 busy signals, hacking away, designing the new wardialer scripts, and having
419 a wonderful time.
420     So I call back from work one day. And it works. BWMS is still here. It's
421 phenomenal. Jeepers. Sondargaard? Michael? L'homme, you devil? MiG? Graymalkin
422 Paragon? Leonard? Piper? Cistern Operator Mike Day? Are any of the Old Guard
423 still calling Backwater? If so, I'll organize the Veritable Quandary meeting.
424     Oh jeez. All these memories. Archives. DEC mainframes. grepping through
425 megabytes. Using statistics programs to grep through BWMS archives looking
426 for misspelling and cross indexing them between callers, to twit out the
427 enemies of Net... Net... My goo'ness... It's been a while.

471 pleased to see Theus back! I don't remember him because I've only been
472 here for a little while. About that Bug Report, Mole. There's no bug. To
473 replace a line, ex. 300 you have to list until you get to 229 and stop
474 in the middle of that line to get to the Command: prompt. Then type "re"
475 and it will show you line 300 and you can replace it. So try "re" 1 line
476 before the desired line to replace. Hope this helps! BTW I don't know why
477 it is like this but it is. See all later! Later AD!

633  
634      "What will I be when I grow up?"
635  
636      Children all over the world ask that question every day.  These kids are o
637 course all quite dull, but their parents prefer to think of them as special.
638 You, as a parent or simply a caring individual, hesitate to disillusion (or eve
639 depress) these curious rug rats by pointing out that every kid in history who
640 has ever grown up turned out to be an adult.
641  
642      It is best that we give these kids a noncommittal but upbeat answer,
643 psychologists tell us.  All of these have been used successfully:
644  
645          1.  Anything you want to be, Sarah.
646  
647          2.  Only time will tell, but you have a wonderful life ahead of you.
648  
649 More?
650  
651  
652          3.  It's exciting to think about, darling, isn't it!
653  
654          4.  A plumber.
655  
656  
657      The first response, of course, is most successful with children named
658 Sarah.  And some people believe that the fourth answer is not noncommittal
659 enough.
660  
661      As you have no doubt found out (unless you are still a special child), one
662 seldom can say much about one's eventual career until after several years of
663 work.  It's hard sometimes even then.  Let's look at a few case studies to see
664 what insights we can glean:
665  
666           Sarah Willetson is a 42-year-old mother of 13 children,
667           but she has a nagging desire to be a nuclear physicist.

672           Arnold Buff is 32 years old.  He is unemployed and lives
673           with his mother, who continues to buy his clothes.  Arnold
674           wants to be the president of a large corporation, but he

678           Magnolia "Eddie Girl" Feldspar is a 45-year-old gambler who
679           lives in Cleveland and wants to run for mayor. She has had
680           varied work experience that includes an unsuccessful five
681           year stint as a waitress.
682  
683  
684      The emerging pattern is quite lear, isn't it!  Were Sarah, Arnold, and
685 Magnolia to consult a competent professional career counselor, all three would
686 be advised to enroll in the Astrid Williams School of Advertising Copywriting
687 and Keypunching Arts.  This of course explains why few people consult that
688 particular professional career counselor.
689  
690      If you are about to embark on your first career and don't know which to
691 choose, don't worry about it, because you can usually change your mind and
692 career later, unless your choice is a career that tends to limit future options
693 For example, it's probably not a good idea to become a bank robber unless you
694 plan to stick with it.
695  
696      Few people read articles about careers unless they need some help in
697 choosing one.  You have been waiting for specific advice, right?  Well, here it
698 More?is: computers. That's right, computers.  No one really understands compute
699 s, so
700 the field offers limitless opportunity, no matter what kind of work you enjoy.
701  
702      If you like selling, sell computers.  It's a lot easier than selling
703 refrigerators.  That surprises you? Well, think about it for a moment.  When yo
704 show a refrigerator to a prospect, he knows exactly what you're selling -- a
705 machine that makes things colder than they are.  He doesn't even have to ask
706 what that strange knob inside does, because he knows it doesn't do anything.  I
707 he doesn't need a refrigerator, you're not going to make a sale.  But show your
708 computer, mentioning its serial ports or multitasking capability at the same
709 time, and the prospect's eyes glaze over as he writes the check.
710  
711      You can't sell?  Then become a computer programmer. It used to be that no
712 one understood what programmers did, so they could say anything to explain why
713 the computer didn't quite do what was required.  Some things never change.

723 I have been called by many names (not all of them repeatable :-)), and have not
724 as yet selected an appropriate handle.  "De'wI' tejHey" is Klingon ("tlhIngan")
725 for "An Apparent Computer Scientist", which is somewhere in between "A So-Calle
726 Computer Scientist" (De'wI' tejqoq) and "A Definite Computer Scientist" 
727 (De'wI' tejna')  which would imply that I take the subject seriously (a fatal
728 mistake!).  Similarly, I fall somewhere between a De'wI' tejHom (literally, a
