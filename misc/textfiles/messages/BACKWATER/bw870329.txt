25 My, my!  How am I so lucky as to be here on the fabled top, on my first
26 visit even!  This is a good sign, I believe.  Yes, I am new to the Inn,
27 but I am not new to the environment and the stories.  Word of this 
28 special retreat from (most) cares spreads wide in the multiverse among
29 certain circles.

34 though we may stay longer.

40 NEW IMPENDING COMMUNICATIONS LAW:
41      
42     Fresh  on  the  heels of the successful implementation of 
43 the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,  the  64th  Oregon 
44 Legislative  Assembly  has  already had committee hearings on 
45 its proposed anti-listining bill, House Bill 2198.  
46     Amending ORS-165.540 and repealing  ORS-133.726  the  new 
47 bill  will make it unlawful in the state of Oregon to "Obtain 
48 or  attempt  to  obtain  the  whole  or   any   part   of   a 
49 telecommunication  or  a  radio  communication  to which such 
50 person is not a participant....unless consent is given by  at 
51 least  one  participant"  or  "if  all  participants  in  the 
52 conversation  are  not  specifically  informed   that   there 
53 conversation is being obtained." 
54     A violation of the proposed law will constitute a Class A 
55 misdemeanor, punishable by fine or jail term.  
56     No  frequency  range  or  service is excluded (other that 
57 broadcasting) by the  wording  of  the  bill,  and  shortwave 
58 utilities  monitoring  as  well scanning will unlawful in the 
59 state of Oregon if this bill is allowed to become a law.  
60     In the bills present wording, amateur radio, CB services, 
61 ship to shore,  aircraft and many other services now open  to 
62 the public will be banned by the proposed law.  
63          
64 ACTION NEEDED TO DEFEAT THIS BILL: Oregon residents are urged 
65     to protest this bill vigorously both 
66 by telephone and letters to there representatives immediately 
67 as  it  appears  that  the  assembly is making rapid progress 
68 without opposition.

70 Copied from a article that appeared in "MONITORING TIMES"  by 
71 Gary  Westfall,  KB6ASP,  Beaverton,  Oregon.   ........

73         
74     Please  pass  this  on to other BBS as a alert to a proposed law 
75 that  may  indeed  infringe  on  the  rights  of  any  person   with 
76 electronics and communications as a hobby or livelihood.  
77

82 Friar: Yes, the article in WW does indeed talk about my ex-partner
83 at U.S. Digital. Don't believe everything you read in Willamette Week
84 though. Jim began learning NLP some time ago, and not for psychic
85 stuff. That is a relatively new direction for him. But when you're 
86 hungry you go in whatever direction brings in money for food.

107 I have no real idea.  The NLP stuff I know he was very into and used.
108 It is nothing new, it has been around for a *very* long time called
109 be different names and such. Though I think it goes further than is
110 realistic to expect out of things. The basic concept behind NLP is that
111 you can know exactly what the other person really is thinking by 
112 watching their eyes and listening to how they speak.  This is nothing new,
113 it is called body language in more normalh circles. Where NLP differs 
114 though is that it states that you can control others by controlling 
115 how they think through the use of the observations. This is nothing 
116 new either, though we are more used to it being called manipulation.
117 NLP is just a formalized means of observation and manipulation.
118 As for the psychic stuff, I wouldn't know, that is a new entry
119 since I knew him. I haven't talked with him on a social basis sinc about 
120 June of last year. I've talked with him since then, but only on a business
121 basis. We've gone our seperate ways. My own thoughts on the subject
122 are drawn on other things. Such as that he hasn't had a positive income
123 for several years,the bank forclosed on his home, he and his wife
124 have not been able to find a solid job and they have two kids to feed
125 and cloth. I've been through some tough times myself, I am still digging
126 out and will be for 2 to 3 years before I will even begin to have a 
127 positive income. I know what goes on inside during extremly trying 
128 times, friends and family not withstanding. Your basic makeup and
129 hold on reality take a great beating. Jim never had a really strong
130 sense of reality, so it wouldn't surprise me if he shifted over and
131 is truely immersed in this. On the other hand he still has to feed
132 himself and his family, and he knows how to make some money this way,
133 and can't find a regular job, and he is certainly opertunistic, so
134 it could be just something to keep him alive. I don't know, as I said,
135 I haven't really talked with him recently to really know what is going
136 on inside his head, nor do I really think that we will ever be as
137 close as we were, we are just too different which is one of the real
138 reasons for the demise of USD, and why I left. We both knew that the
139 company was having problems partly due to our differences, as well
140 as the economic problems (strange how hard times always bring any 
141 problem to the fore).  In January of 86 we went to counseling to try
142 to resolve things. The end result was that we found that we were too
143 different to really make it work, we wanted to go in different directions.
144 And since the company could no longer support us both, we decided that
145 one of us had to leave. At first Jim was going to, but after a lot of
146 thought and budget work I came to the conclusion that USD was not 
147 salvagable, its income level was below that to support me and the required
148 advertising. I did not have any line on money that could pull it out,
149 and the slump in the software business was projected to run for 
150 several more years, and our primary sales item (COPYLINK PLUS for the
151 Sanyo 555 computer) was dwindling fast due to Sanyo's inept marketing
152 practices and the rapidly falling prices of the clones which was 
153 erroding the Sanyo's cost advantage. Thus Sanyo's weren't being sold,
154 and thus neither was our software. Since we never were able to 
155 significantly penitrate the IBM world, that left USD with a downward
156 spiraling income.  As such I opted to get out while the getting was good.
157 I wanted to close the company, but Jim wanted to continue on with it,
158 feeling that he migh tbe able to do something, and that since he didn't
159 have any other prospects that it was better than nothing. So on April
160 first of 1986 I left the company and traded all my interests in the 
161 company in exchange for a promise (and a note) from Jim that he would
162 take over all debts that were against me through the company. As I expected,
163 things never improved, and by July of 86 the bank foreclosed on the company
164 and a week later the office was closed for good. In the meantime I 
165 had been doing some consulting work for Hawthorne Technology, and 
166 later had my accident (broke both heals). In october I began working
167 for Frye Electronics where I still am. The final chapter of this whole mess
168 occured last month, when the bank came looking for the rest of their 
169 money since they didn't get anything of significance from the 
170 foreclosure. And since Jim didn't really have any money, and I was 
171 a co-signer on the loan, they put presure on me to pay up. I countered 
172 with the note of liability from Jim, which would have put tHings in 
173 a nice legal hassle for a long while, so they countered by saying that
174 if we could come up with half the money ($6000) that they would call it
175 even. Sinc eit would have cost me a lot more than that to fight it,
176 I decided to find the money and get it taken care of. But I also required
177 that Jim provide me with a note indicating that USD was no longer 
178 pursuing the interest in CL+ and the other products that I wrote, and 
179 that it acknowledges me as the original author. Thus releasing all
180 contention for rights to me.

302      'Tis a time of decision and torment... change abounds, and I
303 must ask myself if I'm ready for it.  It is hard to know what is
304 right, but that's often true in modern life.  Logic tells me that
305 I should flow and change, but my emotions aren`t so sure.
306      There is so much I want to do with this life.... so many
307 goals.  Sometimes I don't know what is important to me.  Should I
308 stay stable and secure.... or follow a dream?  Dreams are risky. 
309 I doubt if they can ever be obtained.... but how will I know
310 unless I try?
311      Hamlet said, "To be or not to be, that is the question."  He
312 was pondering the act of taking his own life.  But in another

314 Couldn't the act of passively following the easy path be
315 construed as `not to be'?  Ah well...

325 Mikey - Thanks for the explanation.  It helps me to understand a little more
326 about both parties.  I do agree with you that it is the crisis we seek out
327 in our lives, for those are what define us to ourselves, and the outward
328 reactions to those occurences are what define us to others.

341     Skin and the warm weather provided a sensorium for the Sage. His tactile
342 sensations were warm and just slightly sticky with a light heat just shy of
343 breaking into sweat. Audio sensations seemed just the same, as he reminisced
344 over the music of decades past, and the points and emotions the lyrics so
345 easily defined. What had changed in the last year was the visual. Years ago,
346 he would not have predicted this scene.
347  
348     His dark wrapping and garb taken from the Elizabethan Era had been left
349 behind in an donning alcove at home. Fashion was being taken by the hand, by
350 the weather. He wore laced sandals and his white clothes were held to him in
351 a conspiracy between his seamstress and a tanner. Ancient Greece had not died
352 at any point on Earth. The profound art and esthetic it developed was smeared
353 into other cultures, and across the Universe. Proof of it was in his hand;
354 bronzed metal disk that were once the earrings of his wife.
355  
356     He stood out near a tree that would have fit more under the darkened skies
357 of a maritime coast. It was twisted and blackened. In contrast, the sky and
358 the nearby fields and marshes burst with green and blue. Purple was the rare
359 and opulent color, but it was there also. And around the sides of the Inn,
360 and through the court yard, existed the door the Sage had just come through.
361 
362     A diabolical little elf had come up from the basement and poured out a
363 packet of dust into the large cork holes, on the barrels on ale in the
364 alehouse. Only traces of his body had been discernable in the bright light
365 from the windows, but there was enough of a shade to tip off the Sage.
366 
367     For some reason, he decided the patrons might be wisely avoided for a while
368 And a good long while at that. At least a few hours.

386 So saying, a man of medium height dressed all in black backs through door
387 #7-17, his cloak flying as he slams the door.  Turning around, he surveys
388 the room slowly once, and then again.  After a brief pause his inestimable
389 intelligence cuts in.  "Where the hell is this???"  Having thereby drawn
390 the attention of most of the room (as usual for this fellor, not all of
391 it friendly), he walks slowly to the bar and orders a large jolt.  Three
392 lightning bolts later he gets a word in edgewise -- "I ment to drink!"

401 least), and very heartening to read the new works ac[Dvailable for perusal.
402 I am afraid that I have let loose a monstewr[D[D[Der, however; I made the mis-
403 take of giving my roommate this number.  I only wish not to be held
404 responsible for his atrocious jokes.
405      Now that I live in the area and have access to a proper demon-
406 with-modem again( as soom[Dn as roomie shoe[Dws me how yt[D[Dto use the bloody

411 Yet another year has passed, filled with stories and adventure (and, yes, some
412 things which are not so highly thought of).  I have witnessed another year
413 of it all.  I have been lurking and writing for over half of the Inn's 
414 existence, now a total of three years, just now starting my fourth.  I thank
415 all of you who write and weave the fabric of tales, sitting in comfortable
416 chairs about the cheery hearth.

467      "Oh, my achin' head."  Magus awoke from his drunken slumber. 
468 About him, the Inn was quiet . . .  It was early morning, and 
469 most of the patrons had long since departed.  Even the Innkeeper 
470 had disappeared into a back room. 
471      Magus threw back his cowl and ran his hand across his bald 
472 head.  His skull was a spiderweb of blue veins and white flesh.  
473 He did not often reveal his features to others.  The casual 
474 observer only saw his sunken dark eyes and hawk nose beneath his 
475 hood. 
476      "By all the gods, what am I going to do?"  Magus said.  
477 Sitting here drinking was not getting hime closer to the shape- 
478 changer.  He had no idea if her powers would help him, but he had
479 few other alternatives.  Oh well, one more brandy wouldn't hurt, 
480 then he would have to leave. 
481      As Magus stood, his body tingled.  The Calling.  No, not 
482 now, there is too much to do.  Pain exploded in his head, The 
483 Calling was not to be denied.  He must return.  Magus pulled open
484 the oaken door and left the Inn.  He sighed and cast one last 
485 glance at the Rowan tree. 
486      "I wonder if I will again see this place."  The air 
487 shimmered and Magus was gone.

491 l'homme:  Thank you for your kind words of return.  It seems I have been
492 spending only the least amount of time located anywhere near the Inn.
493 And yes, in the short time I spent constructing the tale of the young
494 Master West and myself there was a small sense of growth.  Why, it only
495 seems as yesterday since I've last seen the old stories, the old names...
496 the new wonders.  I recall first I ever saw mention of You was in an
497 adventure with other well known Innklings.
498           Something tells me a shade of those times is about to carry over.

523      Awakening from his stupor (It's amazing what three lightning bolts
524 and a Jolt cola will do to you!), VanderVecken looks up and once again attempts
525 to figure out how he got here.  The locale is fairly normal (bizarre !), the
526 only question is why... but then, last time I asked, someone told me!  Jolt
527 is wonderful to keep one awake, but it's dubious to wake up to -- kind of
528 like waking up to see your ex-girlfriend in bed with you.  Coffee is what
529 one needs, so he blithely yells "Bartender!  owwww..., I shouldn't yell.
530 One God's Blessing, please!"  It could be worse... One friend of mine would
531 ask for his best gallon of lighter fluid.  Feeling his stature slowly
532 increase (this isn't hard when you're getting up off the floor, although
533 balance is another thing entirely), he considers what to do with dayOSthe day.
534 "I need to be helped out -- Does anyone know which way I came in?" 
535 Needless to say, half the building offers, all pointing in the general
536 direction of the front door.  Walking out, he sees an old oak tree, and
537 *knows* that he is *Not* back in Kansas...

548 yes there is a couple of algorithms to find pi. you may do this...
549 pi = circumference of circle / diameter of circle
550 or you can run a program that is very complex & requires at least 80 digits or more of precision.
551 my friend runs the program & has probably quit by now, due to the computers' floating
552 point error (.001=.9999999). this would be better executed by using a language
553 that uses bcd math. less error & more precise, & hopefully NO scientific notation...

562 it directly on (503) 591-0767 or reach it through UUCP with...

573 To whom it may concern:
574 	Net has not left any cipher msgs on this system in almost a
575 year. The above 'code' is not from any Net member. Net has other means
576 of communication these days.
577 	I might add that until we got bored with the waste of time &
578 resources, we actually checked these msgs. They are merely random
579 strings of characters (at least the ones we checked were). And before
580 someone claims that we might just have not known the code, allow me to
581 inform you that there are some rather simple tests that will enable you
582 to determine whether or not a fair sized msg is code or random.
