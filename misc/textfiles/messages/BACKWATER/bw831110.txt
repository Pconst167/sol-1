35 INTERESTING SUBJECT, BUT I DON'T SEE THAT IT APPLIES (EXCEPT VAGUELY).
36 CAPTAIN AMERICA IS CORRECT WHEN HE SAYS THAT JURIES ARE PART OF THE
37 COURTS.  IF ALL JURIES REFUSE TO CONVICT DUE TO A SET OF COMMON SPECIFIC
38 CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR CASES, THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INTERPRETATION
39 BY MUTUAL CONSENT.  SO, YES I STILL BELIEVE THE COURTS HAVE THE FINAL

72 To Whomever:
73 From Dusty
74    Truth in itself is a rather deceptive concept.  A glance at Websters shows
75 such definitions as "a sincerity of action, character, and utterance", "the 
76 state of being the case", "the property (as of a statement) of being in accord
77 with fact or reality", and "a transcendent fundamental or spiritual reality".
78 For myself, I limit the term "truth" (unqualified) to the meaning "the property
79 of being in accord with reality", and accept as true only those statements that
80 can be objectively tested against reality.  In like manner, I accept as "false"
81 (also unqualified) only those statements that can be shown to contravene reality
82 Now-- we have the Judeo-Christian creation proposition and the "theory of ev-
83 olution".  According to my criteria for truth, neither of these is true, and
84 in addition, neither of them is false.  In order to somehow discuss the vast
85 majority of subjects that cannot be shown as either true or false, and with 
86 the understanding that any judgement of their potential truth or falsity is
87 mainly subjective acceptance or rejection of argumentative and physical evidence
88 --I stand by my earlier assertion that "comfort" most nearly describes my 
89 feelings on many subjects.  Sure, I could say "according to my beliefs and 
90 biases, proposition A has a greater probability of being true that proposition
91 B."  I find it just as informative to say that "I am more comfortable with 
92 idea A than with idea B."
93 
94 With that, let's look at some of the arguments that have been raging.  I am
95 much more comfortable with the IDEA of religion that any of the religions that
96 have shown themselves locally.  I am quite uncomfortable with most "Christian"
97 religions, although I might change my mind should one come along that truly
98 followed his teachings.  I have not been truly comfortable with most of the 
99 eastern religions as well... however I am not completely uncomfortable with
100 the "true pure land" sect of Buhddism.  Namu Amida Bhuttsu.   (that covers 
101 me for this life).  In addition, I cannot be completely comfortable with the
102 "theory of evolution" (particularly as presented by its opponents) but I am
103 comfortable with most of the arguments and evidence given by the proponents.
104 
105 However-- whether or not (following the evolving universe back to the "big 
106 bang" and the created universe back to the creator) either case, or neither
107 is true-- the search goes on for a prime cause.  If the universe was caused
108 by an initial explosion,  where did the matter and energy to cause this expl-
109 osion come from?  If the universe was created (either by a being who created
110 the forces of evolution or who created the evidences of these forces for it's
111 own reasons) who created the creator?  Each step we reason backwards still 
112 requires a first cause if we hold that every effect requires a prior cause.
113 Ah well, Goedel proved that any system complex enough to describe itself cannot
114 be show to be fully consistent.
115 
116 Just a disquieting thought-- assume the "big bang" theory is correct.  The 
117 primal matter before the explosion indeed could contain all knowledge of 
118 the universe-- it contained the components of our present universe.  It was
119 everywhere, knew everything.  God? ...
120 Perhaps the "big bang" was God's death throes, and we are the maggots feeding
121 off His corpse."
122 
123 :::I remain uncomfortable with that idea:::
124 ----------------Dusty---------------------------------------------------------
125 Pam:
126 Maybe you didn't 'get' the joke.  Don't worry, it was intended to be somewhat 
127 obscure.  The line about 'No-one expects the Spanish Inquisition!' is from a Monty Python show, which totally by coincidence
128 was shown a few nights ago.  Unless you've seen the show, you won't understand the joke.  Aside-----How many folks out there 
129 are Python fans?  Don't everyone raise their hands at once......
130      But seriously, what DO you think of a government that would keep us ignorant of our rights, especially the right that
131 says the Jury has the final decision?  It would be like trying to gloss over the 5th amendment, threatening defendants with
132 long prison terms if they didn't admit their guilt. Quote from somewhere: "If you don't know what your rights are, you haven't
133 got any!"
134 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Anon :::::::::::
135 P.S.  Yes, I know that people realize that the jury has the 'final decision', but they don't know that in reaching it they
136 can ignore any law they wish, any instructions they are given, etc.  Just had to clear up that point.
137 *************************************************************************
138 Anon: You should read what PAM said more carefully, Yes, she did recognize
139 the line. Read what she said. After all, there are two chief weapons.. no,
140 three chief weapons... no, four chief weapons...........
141 Dusty: Thank you, it is not often that one sees an opinion expressed around
142 here in realistic terms. As you indicate, these things are really based on
143 what you are comfortable with and what you personally will accept as 
144 'true' or 'false' evidence to support or detract that which you beleive
145 to be reality. This makes another persons reality no less real however,
146 even if it is directly opposed to your own version. Facts can be found to
147 support most any concept you want to come up with. Even scientists despite
148 their protests to the opposite base their world on certain precepts that
149 they 'believe' in. They too fall pray to misdirection and fanatisism(?)
150 (I was reminded the other day of a rather famous discovery made some years
151 back called 'Poly water'. How many out there remeber that one?

154 P.S. CHUCK: I am have difficulty getting the info on the modem parts.
155 I no longer have a lot of the info needed, and I have to regenerate
156 it. As such ths takes time. (Calling people up and asking dumb questions
157 like "I remember seeing a modem chip once, I think it was made by TI,
158 but I'm not sure. Do you know what I'm talking about?") AMD makes a 
159 modem chip that would be compatible to the PCS-103 modem (300 baud 
160 Bell 103 and 1200 bad Bell 202). But they want $40.00 each for them.
161 This makes them a bit expensive. I don't expect to see this price change
162 much for a while it has been stable all year. Also in my explorations
163 I discovered that the IC market has gone crazy again (20 week backlogs
164 ect.) and as such is next to impossible to get parts anyway. You can 
165 get a few if you are willing to pay 10 times the normal cost. The last 
166 time this happened, about six months later business came out of a
167 recession and was booming for about 2-3 years before it fell on its
168 face again. Anyway, I'm glad I ain't in the hardware market like I
169 use to be, I got enough problems without trying to figure out where
170 I'm going to get my next 74LS00 from, or what I can use instead.

200 Rereading the messages, I expect you're right about PAM and the Inquisition.
201 I do remember the nonsense about Polywater.  How long ago was that, any way?  10 years?  I think they finally chalked it up
202 to contaminants in the water...  And what about the recent 'Hitler Diaries.'  Seems they were written on a book bound in
203 Imitation Leather, a material first manufactured in the 50's.  That really embarrassed everyone.

208 WELL NOW!
209 DEAR PAM: NO, BUT THE FELLOW YOU MENTION IN THE PATROL IS DEFINITLY A ROLE 
210 MODEL FOR ME. NOBODY GOT ANYTHING PAST THAT GUY! WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME.
211 
212 TO ALL ACTUAL CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS BBS - (LOOSE DEF. - SOMEONE WHO DOES
213 SOMETHING BESIDES GROUSE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF WHAT OTHERS ARE WRITING HERE
214 IS WORTH, AND WHO PROBABLY HAS A HANDLE OF SOME KIND) :  WE SEEM TO BE
215 HEARING FROM OUR LURKERS THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. LURKERS, AS YOU KNOW, ARE
216 THOSE ANNOYING PEOPLE WHO TIE UP THE LINE FOR HOURS ON END EVERY DAY NOW 
217 WITHOUT LEAVING ONE LINE TO INDICATE PARTICIPATION. SINCE WE HAVE NOW
218 ATTRACTED WHAT MUST BE DESCRIBED AS AN AUDIENCE, I GUESS WE MUST NOW 
219 QUALIFY AS AN ENTERTAINMENT MEDIUM. I NOTE THAT OUR NEILSON GROUP WANTS
220 SOMETHING MORE ENTERTAINING THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. SOMEBODY
221 MENTIONED THE A-TEAM. I GUESS THAT SAYS IT ALL.
222    BEFORE COMPLYING WITH SOMETHING LIGHTER, I SSUGGEST THAT WE FORM A UNION.
223 SOMETHING LIKE THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD MAYBE. AND SINCE WE HAVE NOW TO
224 COMPLY WITH THE WISHES OF PEOPLE WHO APPARENTLY HAVE LITTLE CREATIVE 
225 DRIVE TO SPEAK OF THEMSELVES, I SUGGEST WE AT LEAST CAN RESPOND TO THIS BY
226 SELLING COMMERCIALS. THIS WILL GIVE THE AUDIENCE SOMETHING FAMILIAR AND
227 MUCH LESS IN DEPTH TO COPE WITH, WHILE COMPENSATING US FOR OUR TROUBLE.
228    I WOULD LIKE TO CONDUCT A PREFEREENCE SURVEY BEFORE TURNING THIS INTO
229 AN ACTUAL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, SO AS TO INCREASE OUR CHANCES OF HITTING
230 THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF OUR DETRACTORS
231 DID NOT SEE FIT BE BECOME KNOWN, EVEN AS FAR AS ASSUMING A NOM-DE-PLUME.
232    I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOMEONE COMPLAIN ABOUT
233 WHAT CAME, AFTER ALL, QUITE FREE. THAT THEY ARE NOT AWARE THAT THEY ARE
234 FAR OUT OF LINE IN NOT CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING TOWARDS THEIR OVERHEAD IS
235 NOT SURPRISING, EITHER. JUST THE USUAL DISSAPOINTMENT.
236   SO WHAT'L IT BE ? - ACSII CHARLIE'S ANGELS? HYDROPLANE RACING VIA
237 TELEPHONE? MUD-WRESTLING MUDRAKERS?
238   LETS FIGURE IT OUT! IF THEY'LL TUNE IN HERE TO LISTEN TO US TALK ABOUT
239 TAXES, EVEN GIVEN THEIR COMPLAINTS, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE
240 COULD GET AWAY WITH COMMERCIALS. JUST THINK UP THE RIGHT TYPE OF DRIVEL
241 FOR THEM AND WE'LL ALL GET RICH! THIS MAY BE IT! FAME! FORTUNE! A SHOT
242 AT A COMPUTER EMMY! MIKEY - I GOT TWO MORE COMPUTERS, WE CAN EXPAND, SET UP

261 
262   Hrothgar, the original ( i wish i could dig up the Readers Digest type
263 place that it was in originally) figure was 10%. That is, 90% of our
264 "brainpower" went untapped. This figure (and misconception) came from
265 the '50's mind-mapping experiments. The researchers would give some unfort-
266 unate a local and open a flap in their scull, and stimulate various regions
267 of the brain (surface) with an electric probe. The guinea pig would respond
268 with something like "oooh, yes.....i can see it clearly now...my high school
269 graduation...there's aunt poly"   etc.... or " i can taste strawberry-nut
270 ice cream" or "i smell burning rubber".......Well, it seems that probing
271 around on the brain surface the researchers could only find "active" areas
272 (places that elicited responces) covering about 10% of the surface...The 
273 other 90% , when stimulated , did nothing.  " nothing?!? "
274 people asked??  "nothing observable" the researchers replied. Thus goes
275 the 10% story.........D L 's version is a "Christian Science amplified
276 for the Masses" version (and obviously rediculous (as redic as my spelling
277 ??)  )...probably the same roots.......

374 was right.
375 Richard:
376 MCI and Sprint are alternative long-distance telephone services.  To use them, you dial a local number (called
377 and access number) then enter your ID code, then the number you wish to dial.  Savings are about 30% off of regular.
378 Local access number for Sprint is 295-8300.  To apply for Sprint, call this number, wait for the tone, then
379 dial 111234 (I think) which should be the operator for Sprint.  From there, play it by ear.  Oh, forgot... You hafta have
380 a tone-dial phone.     I don't know about how to get MCI, but it can't be too hard, either.

437 ************************************************************
438 CHUCK: NO, JUST WANTED TO KEEP YOU INFORMED ON THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS
439 AS THEY ARE. I STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO CHECK YET BEFORE I CAN
440 GIVE YOU A FINAL QUOTE, BUT THE PRICE FOR THE CHIPS DOES APPEAR TO BE
441 A BIT HIGHER THEN I WAS ORIGINALLY LEAD TO BELIEVE. 
442 ********************************** CISTOP MIKEY ******************:
443 JODY: There are two accepted definitions of wizards, the clasical version,
444 and the modern version. The modern version as PAM indicated is one who
445 does wonderous things with current technology and create new technology.
446 While the clasical version was more noted for the use of supernatural
447 forces (usually thru the use of some device to focus the power or in the
448 case of weaker wizards as the source of the power). In the true sense
449 however, the clasical wizard used both technology and supernatural force
450 to accomplish the tasks at hand using whatever was best to do the job.
451 not that this differs from a witch or worlock (witch=female worlock=male)
452 who only use supernatural forces. Although a wizard can be female, most
453 are called witches. This can sometimes be a misnomer generally caused
454 by the over advertising of witches causing people to think that all 
455 females who employ supernatural powers are witches. When speaking of
456 wizards as female or male, they are called sorcerer(male) or sorceress
457 (female). Again because of the confusion with the role model of witches
458 a witch is sometimes called a sorceress, and visa versa. Another aspect
459 which often shows up particularly with the more powerful wizards, is 
460 that they have a much longer life span then normal. normally measured
461 in the hundreds or thousands of years. While a witch or worlock are
462 seldom placed in this catagoy. As you can see, the differances are
463 a bit muddled, but most do agree that there is a difference. At the
464 other end, a worlock is often mistakenly identified as a wizard, again
465 as a result of over advertising in regard to wizards being only male.
466 Although popular stories like to place wizards as good guys and witches
467 as bad gals, this is simply not the case. There are many good and bad
468 witches and wizards, it is their actions which belie them not their
469 titles. As to good and bad magic, (sometimes called white(good) or
470 black(bad) magic that the wizards or witches perform, there is no
471 clear cut form it is usually prescribed as a result of of the magic
472 is used for that causes the label to be placed. As a result a 'good'
473 wizard could use the same magic that a 'bad' wizard uses and it would
474 be considered proper. Yet the same magic employed by the bad wizard
475 is condemed as evil. It is the use that the magic is put that places 
476 the title. A bad wizard is labled as such because a majority of the
477 magic performed is for 'Evil' purposes (depending on what is defined
478 as evil of course) While a good wizard is labled as a result of using
479 magic for good purposes (whatever that may be). One final note,
480 although it is sometimes shown that wizards are flambout and public,
481 this is not normally the case. Most powerful wizards prefer stelth and
482 solitude as it makes the job much easier if the actions are not known.
483 This keeps rival wizards from fouling up the works. Also a powerfull
484 spell requires that the caster be known to properly counter it. This is
485 not possible to hide if the spell is being cast in front of the world.

500    Dave:
501      what gives? if you think it, type it! exactly what is the problem?
502 are YOU a "Christian Scientist"? Don't go to doctors, et al? Would
503 you like me to rephrase "  'Christian Science' amplified for the 
504 masses "   to   " 'Christian'  science-amplified-for-the-masses "?
505 I won't, i MEANT "Christian Science" as in "Christian Scientist". I
506 guess i just dont get where you are coming from. I certainly wasn't
507 attacking d if thats what set you off. What is it? 
508 
509   more concisely (less?):
510 
511 a)   precisely what is it I " seem to like to say and be  "  ?
512 
513 b)   ignorance on who's part?
514 
515 c)   I was not plying my oft-feeble attempts at humor (one of the few
516 times!) though the folly of such beliefs are, in themselves, humorus.
517 
518 d)   I believe most would agree on the relative accuracy of my facts.
519 
520 e)   I, Sir, am Never drunk.  I do not partake of such "beverages".
521                                             Aaron!
522 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
523 Aaron: Stop fooling around for your own ego.  If you didn't "get where [I]
524 am coming from", it must have been because you didn't want to.  I quote you:
525 "D L 's version is a "Christian Science amplified for the masses" version 
526 (and obviously rediculous [sic]..."  It is clear that, in addressing that to
527 HROTHGAR (who asked d to identify her version of the Bible), you made false
528 reference to a Christian Science version of the Bible.  That religious group
529 uses the King James standard version;  other writings are used for teaching 
530 their doctrine as well.  That is fact;  it doesn't vary with who believes it
531 or how great is the "relative accuracy" of your FACTS!  Indeed.
532 Now, what you are should be known best to yourself;  what I perceive
533 cannot be listed here, neither socially nor legally.  Look at yourself
534 sometime as an alternative to asking, no, demanding to perform for others.
535 One need not drink alcohol to be intoxicated;  if you deny such states, may
536 we chalk your late-night bout with some drink (the "recipe" for which you
537 shared) to youthful enthusiasm and wit?  Save it for another audience.
538 I was offended by your use of the word "ridiculous" before and of your
539 present scoff about one's personal attitude toward medical practitioners,
540 and the nearness of the word "folly".  Some people yet dear to me are
541 neither guilty of folly nor in need of modern medical "services".
542 d can defend herself;  I do not speak for anyone but myself.
543 Nor do I lack the self-discipline to avoid mindlessly speaking what may
544 occur to me silently.  To revise a recent quote;" if YOU think it, YOU type
545 it."   Your other 'challenges' above will go unanswered.
546 Further discussion of this topic, if necessary, can best take place on
547 private media.  Failing to sense requisite sincerity, I shall decline.

550 the 10% story.........D L 's version is a "Christian Science amplified 
551 for the Masses" version (and obviously rediculous (as redic as my spellig
552 ??)  )...probably the same roots.......             
553 
554 
555  The text above was appended to my explanation of the "10% brainpower"
556 story to explain why I was answering with "10%" when HROTHGAR requested
557 information on the "billionth" story. It was purely to propose that 
558 D L 's "story" had the same roots as my "story", with slight enhancements
559 to the magnitude of certain key figures. The "obviously ridiculus" came
560 into play because of another patrons observation that such a figure
561 would indicate that we are using the equiv. of 10 cells.
562 
563 strange, HROTHGAR seems to have mysteriously vanished...yet Dave is 
564 quite alive and well.....hmmmmmmmmmm...

594      IF WE NEED A NEW SUBJECT, I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHY TELEVISION IS
595 APPARENTLY INCAPABLE OF HAVING TRUE DRAMA.  BY THIS, I MEAN CHARACTERS
596 THAT CHANGE FROM EPISODE TO EPISODE AS THEY GROW, WHY IMPORTANT EVENTS
597 (SUCH AS THE DEATH OF A FIANCEE) SEEM TO HAVE NO EFFECT BEYOND THAT
598 PARTICULAR EPISODE (NEXT WEEK, IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT HAVE HAPPENED FROM
599 THE ATTITUDE OF THE PROTAGONIST), ETC..  I HAVE FELT THAT THE IMPORTANCE
600 OF SYNDICATION, WHERE A SERIES WILL BE RUN IN WHATEVER ORDER THE BUYER
601 SEES FIT, PRECLUDE SUCH CONTINUITY, AND THE SIMPLE FACT THAT EACH SHOW 
602 IS WRITTEN BY A DIFFERENT WRITER WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHERE HE WANTS
603 TO TAKE THE CHARACTERS.  AND THAT WRITERS, WITH THEIR EGOS ON THE LINE,
604 DON'T WANT TO USE INPUT FROM ANYONE ELSE ON THEIR SCRIPTS ABOUT ANYTHING.
605 IT'S THEIR STORY, SO HANDS OFF!  WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO COMMENT (RAGE, RANT,
606 SCREAM, EDITORIALIZE, ETC.) ABOUT TELEVISION AND IT'S EFFECTS UPON OUR
607 LIVES?
608 
609      A COMMENT BY HROTHGAR (I THINK, OL' BATGUANO, FORGIVE ME IF I'M 
610 WRONG) HAS CAUSED BE TO WONDER:  HOW MANY OF OUR OLD CONTRIBUTERS ARE 
611 STILL USING THE SYSTEM?  AKONIS, ELBERICH, PAUL, ARE YOU STILL OUT
612 THERE?  AND THOSE I HAVE FORGOTTEN TOO, DO YOU STILL READ THE SYSTEM?  
613 WHY DO YOU NO LONGER FAVOR US WITH YOUR PROSE, d?  THE "DEATH" SUBJECT
614 ON DISK A CAUSES ME TO LONG FOR TIMES WHEN THERE WERE MORE POETIC USERS
615 AS WELL AS THE DEBATERS.  I HAVE LONG BEEN AWARE OF MY OWN MORTALITY, 
616 SO I FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF UNUSUAL DEATHS TO BE TIRESOME AND SOMEWHAT  
617 JUVENILE (NO OFFENSE MEANT).  IMPENDING DEATH IS ALL TOO CLOSE A SUBJECT
618 FOR ME TO STILL FIND INTEREST IN IT.  I'LL JUST AVOID FURTHER COMMENT 
619 ON IT UNTIL A NEW SUBJECT IS RAISED, OR SOMEONE CAN SHOW THAT, AS A
620 SUBJECT, IT HAS MORE POSSIBILITY THAN IT HAS SHOWN.
621 
622      I ASKED FOR SOMEONE TO USE THE REMAINING SPACE ON THIS DISK, AND 
623 NOW I FIND THAT I HAVE USED IT.  GOSH, FOLKS, I GUESS I'M JUST DRONING 
624 ON ENDLESSLY TODAY, WITH LITTLE TO SAY.  SINCE I'M NEARLY OUT OF SPACE
625 (TO EVERYONE'S ENORMOUS GRATIFICATION), I HAD BETTER CLOSE.  ON THE SUB-
627 JECT OF LIFE (& DEATH), HAVE YOU ALL SEEN MONTY PYTHON'S MEANING OF LIFE?
