37         I am on! Centroidal connectors engage with a creak. Semi-distolic
38 pressurizers hum with a soft beat as they interact with tri-axial mobility
39 joints. The database gets a 52K core dump from the auxiliary databus,
40 causing the autostart ROMs to begin their boot procedure. Memory diagnosis
41 is run, and upon completion, authorization for bi-lateral limb checkout
42 is given. Quick checks to all power centers reveal the entire mobility
43 network is fully functional and ready for sequencing from central
44 processing. In the lateral sections, auto-gyros are spun to torque and re-
45 stabilization process is begun.
46 
47         Pressurization is complete, and the the pre-authorized limb
48 checkout commences. Right check: 0, 45, 90, 180 complete. Left check:
49 ditto. Main stabs check: Right OK Left OK. Bi-lats checkout complete.
50 Begin sensory startup. Visual sensors open. Adjust that iris! Nominal.
51 Auditory sensors begin startup. Volume check, watch the gain. Check
52 for overload. Nominal. Olfactory check: Blast pressure valve niner-five,
53 clear that passageway. Incoming pressure normal. Exhaust backpressure
54 negative. Standby reservoirs drained and fully functional. Vocal circuits
55 check: Stand by with surge for vocal test. Ready...go! Auditory report,
56 vocal prep AOK. Small problem with lubricant; minimal amounts present.

76 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?.
77 PaPa! yes, interesting to say the least. Next time lets not abort console 
78 during a disk packing. It seems that when it rains, it pours, and yet another
79 twit has surfaced. It seems that somebody managed to leave mail to Le Nerd,
80 under the name of Jim bell, saying that he wanted his semi-disk back!
81 Needless to say, Nerd central was a bit suprised! Twit/new also left mail on
82 most of the 1200 baud systems around saying that he was shutting down cbbs/
83 aloha. also not true. It seems as if my work is never done, sigh, but I live
84 for the moments of glory at the unmasking of some particularly vile twit.
85 and yes, I did have fun with that child molester!

89 THE MISSING KEY (PART 1)
90 TROUBLE WAS BREWING DOWN IN THE SLEAZY PART OF THE TOWN OF ARROWWART, THE
91 ONLY CITY ON THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF THE ISLE OF CLOUDS. AARON HAD HEARD 
92 THAT THE COLONY OF GIZERFFS (A TRULY DISGUSTING LOT) HAD STOLEN THE ORB 
93 OF TIME AND THE MAP TO EGOR' S PITFALL. TWOOD BE A SORRY DAY (AND NIGHT)
94 IF THE GIZERFFS GOT INTO THE SACRED HALL OF EGOR. THE GATE OF PURPLE HAZE
95 WOULD UNFOLD AND CASTE ETERNAL DARKNESS AND CHAOS ONTO THE LOVELY LAND OF
96 THE ISLE OF CLOUDS. 
97 
98      THE ORDERS FROM THE COUNCIL OF CAPTAINS WENT OUT TO THE FOUR 
99 ADVENTURES: ARRON OF HILLCROP, ZORGON THE VILE, THE WIZ & SKIP THE 
100 WANDERER. EACH HAS SEEN THE WARS AND EACH COULD CARE LESS, BUT THEY ALL
101 
102 (TO BE CONTINUEDD)
103 ===============================================================================
104 THE MISSING KEY (PART 2)
105 
106 KNEW IF THEY DID NOT HELP RETRIEVE THE ORB AND THE MAP, THEY WOULD NOT
107 THEMSELVES ESCAPE THE FORTHCOMING DOOM.
108      THUS THE FOUR WERE IN ARROWWART, EACH AT THE MONENT EXPERIENCING
109 THE SO-CALLED LAST WISH BEFORE DEATH (THEY KNEW THE ODDS OF RETURNING
110 WERE APX 1 OUT OF ETERNITY). ZORGON WAS VISITING THE HOUSE OF THE 
111 PLATINUM POOTANG, ARRON PRESENTLY DRINKING GRIFFIN'S BLOOD AT THE GREEN
112 GRIFFON, THE WIZ ALSO WAS DRINKING BUT NOT AT THE INN. HE INSTEAD DRANK
113 WITH SKIP AT THE COUNCILS LODGE. (THE COUNCIL HAS THE BEST ROCKWATER
114 GLOWWORM SQUEEZINGS THIS SIDE OF TOCUMS GRAIL). EACH OF THE CAPTAINS 
115 DONATED 100 GOLD DISKS FOR THE PLEASURES OF THE ADVENTURES. MEANWHILE...
116 GROUT, HEADMAN OF THE PACK, WAS CONTIMPLATING THE ARRIVAL OF THE FOUR IN
117 THE CITY. HE HAD HEARD THAT THE COUNCIL HAD FUNDED THE RETURN OF THE 
118 ASSBITE QUARTET (SO FONDLY CALLED BY HIMSELF) BUT HOPED THAT THEY WOULD
119 SHOW. NOW A NEW PLAN HAD TO FORM...DAM'N! THOUGHT AARON WHILE HE WALKED
120 THE AVENUE OF WHORES. HE KNEW GETTING ZORGON OUT OF THAT HELLHOUSE WOULD
121 BE LIKE TRYING TO TAKE A BONE FROM A BONER, HOPELESS. (NOT TO MENTION 
122 THAT YOU COULD LOSE MORE THAN YOUR FINGER-ARM-SHOULDER-ETC). 
123      THE SHINING PORTAL OF LOVE WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM NOW AS 
124 HE WALKED TO THE END OF THE AVENUE. HA! THE MADAM HAD CAUGHT WIND OF 
125 HIM AS THEY BOTH HAD ILL TIDINGS TO REMEMBER FROM THEIR LAST MEETING.
126 POOR ZORGON WAS SITTING IN THE GUTTER WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS HEADS, 
127 PROBABLY PRAYING THAT THE OLD WOMAN WILL GET HERS FROM BEHIND NEXT TIME.
128 "COM ON, YOU IDIOT!" CRIED AARON, "WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO SIT ON ARSES
129 TONIGHT. WE HAVE 5 MINUTES TO GET TO THE LODGE " "ALRIGHT, WHERE THE #$%"
130 IS THE WIZ & SKIPPER?". "THIER PROBABLY WAITING FOR US THERE RIGHT NOW! 
131 WILL YOU GET UP AND LETS GET GOING!" CRIED ARRON. 
132      AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE FOUR WERE AGAIN UNITED AT THE LODGE WHERE
133 THE PASHA GAVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSULTING THE LAIR OF THE DREADED 
134 GIZERFFS. ONLY 1 WEEK REMAINED BEFORE THE GIZERFFS COULD USE THE ORB
135 TO ENTER THE HALL OF OZONE WHICH EMPTIED INTO THE GATE OF PURPLE HAZE.
136 THE GROUP LISTENED THE DRONING OF THE PASHA, EACH BARLY AWARE OF THE
137 WARNINGS HE SPOKE. ALL WERE FULLY KNOWLEDGABLE IN THE TRAPS THAT LAY 
138 AHEAD. THE JOURNEY WOULD START BEFORE THE MORN TO ENABLE SECRECY OF
139 THEIR DEPARTURE.
140      THE MORNING HAHELD NO SURPRISES FOR THE ADVENTURING QUARTET AS THE
141 FOUR EAGLES FLEW TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN OF COSMOS. (THESE ARE HUGE BIRDS 
142 
143 WITH A WINGSPAN OF 40+ FEET). IT WOULD TAKE THE BETTER PART OF THREE
144 DAYS TO ARRIVE AT THE MOUNTAIN THOUGHT AARON WHILE WATCHING ZORGON
145 RELIEVE HIS BADLY ABUSED PAUNCH. "THE VILE ONE WAS THE PERFECT NAME
146 FOR ZORGON" THOUGHT SKIP, AS HE TRIED IN VAIN TO DEFLECTED THE HEAVINGS
147 OF THE VILE ONE. SUDDENLY AN ARROW SCREAMED BY THE WIZ'S HEAD, "AWAKE!
148 THE HAWKMEN ARE OPON US!!" CRIED THE WIZ WHO WAS READYING A TANGLEWEB
149 SPELL. SKIP BROUGHT HIS TRUSTY PHOTON RIFLE TO HIS SHOULDER AND PROCEEDED
150 TO DISINTIGRATE THE FIRST ATTACK WAVE WHILE ZORGON AND AARON READIED
151 MATCHING MAGIN C CROSSBOWS. THE SKIRMISH LASTED ONLY MINUTES AS THE BADLY
152 ARMED HAWKMEN FOUND THAT 50 TO 4 ARE NOT GOOD ODDS FOR FIGHTING THESE
153 FOUR WARRIORS. THE REST OF THE TRIP WENT UNINTERRUPED TILL THEY LANDED
154 AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN OF COSMOS.

182 the white light was carried on the crisp air of early damn...

184   slowly... and noticing the white spout his breath caused... tilean pulled
185 further up the drain pipe... and soon... he mounted the roof...
186 
187   from there it was a few shorts skips... one ladder and a flight of stairs...
188 and he closed his door... another night he had come home undetected...
189 
190   tilean sat at the terminal... and slowly started to turn everything on... and
191 that includes a small stereo... to which tilean tuned a favored station...
192 
193   and after a few minutes of keys clicking... and a few thousand calls... the
194 eyes of tilean peered over to the side of the terminal...
195 
196   some papers were shuffling amongst themselves... and all alone... it was a
197 weird thing to watch... and then... tilean thought he saw...

214                               "UNDER Financed: Part 3"
215      Arjusk smiled slightly as he watched Elizabeth chew David out once more
216 for calling her 'Liz'.  She detested the name, and threatened to get violent
217 the next time he said it.  Peterson backed off.
218      They'd only been in San Fransisco a few hours.  The orders had been quite
219 clear: Act like tourists until dark, then go to work.  They'd tried hard to
220 act the tourist part.  At the moment, they were inside the Ripley Museum,
221 gaping at the displays in mock-fascination.  Arjusk wasn't sure if David's
222 fascination was mock or not, but he didn't care.
223      "Hey, Tony, dig this mermaid skeleton!" David called.  "Ain't it a riot?"
224      Elizabeth threw up her hands in disgust.  Despite UNDERGROUND's careful
225 training, Peterson was still the rude boor he always was.  UNDERGROUND's
226 therapists had given up on him long ago.
227      "Whazza matter, Liz, did I embarrass you?" David said.
228      With a motion faster than the eye could follow it, Elizabeth demonstrated
229 to Peterson why she was "Operative Ryan"- her punch was so swift as to be
230 almost undetectable to anyone but the recipient.
231      A loud "oopf" emanated from David, who'd obviously had the wind knocked
232 out of him.  "Why'd ya do that for?" he asked.
233      "It's Elizabeth, or Ryan, or Ms. Ryan to you, buddy.  NOT Liz."
234      "Stop, you two," Arjusk broke in.  "Let's move on.  I'd like to eat before
235 we continue."
236      Peterson was glad to do anything that would further distract Elizabeth.
237 "Okay, Tony.  Hey, why're you so nervous about, anyway?  There's practically
238 no one else here."
239      Arjusk paused, then spoke.  "I'm not quite sure.  I've just got a bad
240 feeling about this job, that's all.  Emanations, if you will.  Bad vibes.  A
241 feeling of impending doom..."
242      "Enough, Tony.  I get the idea, and I wouldn't waste my breath trying to
243 get David to understand.  It'd take another week.  Let's go."
244      They left, Elizabeth and Arjusk just slightly ahead of Peterson, who had
245 the distinct impression that he'd been insulted, but wasn't sure.

263      The Cathode Plate: the real sixth and hopefully concluding eppisode!
264      He found that thair was great depth of redundancy and that by a few minor
265 reconfigurations, nearly of the mechine's origeonal functions could be restored
266   In rerairing the mobile he disabled all of it's lethal functions.  The mechine
267 must have been awair of this but made no obnection.  Not without trepidation
268 Thenan tried the autochief, and was delighted to find the resaults of nearly
269 gormet quality.  With funcionality restored as fully as practical, he spent 
270 hexichrons and hexichrons ploughing through the mechine's archievs.  With a 
271 small portion of it, carefully isolated and off line from the rest, he attemp-
272 ted to reestablish contact with it's former net.  He found that most of it's 
273 brother nodes either could not or would not respond.  Those that did were as 
274 irrational and incohierent as itself had been.  He found in it's archieves te
275 the locations of these other nodes as well as a complete artificial world, 
276 appearently abondoneded for melinia.  He had a printout made of these loca-
277 tions w;hich he folded and tucked inside his shirt into a concealed pocket.  
278 This, he knew, would be the begining of a lifelong adventure.  It occured to 
279 him that with what he had learned he could no longer be held against his will
280  yet he remained and continued to converse with it at length.  He slept.  On 
281 awaikening the conversation resumed ware it had left off.
282      In due time, many of the colonests were restored and started poping up 
283 on the plates ware they had dissappeared.  Others, for one reason or another,
284 could not.  Defense systems person Cila was one of these.
285      Thenan promesed then that he would return from time to time when he could
286 and indeed was latter able to keep that promise many times.  No one else has
287 ever found a way to gain access to that sealed chamber.  As a parting gift the
288 mechine made a complete copy of Thenan's awairness and stored it in it's files.
289   Now whenever Thenan 'dies', someware a featus is immpressed with that pattern
290 and his spirit migrates to it.
291      This is not compleate immortality for eventualy the immage or the mechine
292 itself will go the way of all things.  Until it does however, his awairness 
293 may live one life after another for thousands, perhaps millions, of years.  
294 ...and...  Though Cila could not be restored, unbeknownst even to Thenan, the 
295 mechine took and stored a simmiliar precies of her!
296      Seeing the Lucabethu pioneers being returned, the remaining crew of the 
297 Jeluni knew something was up.  Contact was reestabilished with the sector 
298 capitol and the ship prepaired to lift.  Even so, Thenan's 'rematerialization'
299  sitting lotus-like, directly in the center of Jeluni's bridge, came as some-
300 thing of a supprize to one and all.
301      Many hexichrons of debriefing passed before everyone on board was sat-
302 isfied.  By then, Lucabethu's sun was just another star swimming in the depths
303 of the void.

361 with all the bitching and moaning that went on about him, I now sort of
362 miss the satyrist, not for his use/abuse of other peoples borders and 
363 names, but for the different aproach he took to so many things, it was
364 refreshing in many ways.  Even his making fun of people, would have
365 been tolerable if he had done so ONLY under his own name and without
366 crude references.
367 Those of you who were not at the Nerd-O-Fest missed out on some good

403 		    THINGS TO DO WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN
404      If your system has a 98% uptime rate and you are diligent, very
405 hardworking and responsible, then this article is not for you.  If, however,
406 your system hiccups, coughs, has frequent schizophrenic fits and enjoys
407 restful afternoon naps, I offer awsistance to fill in the empty, boring hours
408 that you might have spent documenting, reading technical journals and otherwise
409 improving your data processing skills:
410 * Complain about your salary.
411 * Complain about your manager and how you can do his job better than he can.
412 * Update your resume.
413 * Use the lovely squares, circles and other symbols on your template to achieve
414   a masterpiece of high-tech art.
415 * Call Dial-a,Joke.
416 * Take the stress test given in any fitness magazine and discover that you
417   checked "yes" to every question, and your cumulative score indicates an
418   imminent breakdown.
419 * Call Dial-a-Prayer.
420 * Phone your technical support group and discover (again) the line is still
421   busy.
422 * Do isometric exercises and hope no one sees your twitch.
423 * Water the plant on your desk that looks as though it has had a long,
424   lingering illness.
425 * Get yoqr eighth cup of coffee.
426 * Clean out your desk, and remove all old, rotting chocolate chip cookies
427   that are sitting next to your Addidas running shoes.
428 * Throw out all 224 compiled versions of the same program that you were keeping
429   "just in case."
430 * Improve your New York Times crossword skills after stealing a dictionary
431   from the department secretary.
432 * Examine the local DP salary survey, and discover what you already know:
433   You're underpaid.
434 * Examine Computerworl` position announcements.
435 * Draw a face on the CRT using X's and Y's.
436 * Find out all the neat toys you can make with paper clips.
437 * Reflect on the fact that major drug dealers never have to go through this,
438   and that each owns a Mercedes Benz.  Consider a major career change.
439 * Investigate the cost of opening a fruit-and-vegetable stand on a good corner
440   near your office.
441 * Do weight-lifting exercises using 5-lb quality assurance manuals.
442 * Revile the specs of the systems analyst.
443 * Make paper airplanes out of the standards manual.
444 * Denigrate the programming practices of your predecessor.
445 * Have a good laugh by reading management's idea of a five-year DP plan.
446 * Construct a Frisbae out of a disk drive.
447 * Rejoice in the fact that with the system down, you have the perfect excuse
448   for not meeting the deadlina you weren't going to meet anyway.
449 * Break into the snack machine after it eats up your last quarter.
450 * Crumple the systems analysts' flowcharts into little balls, and then see
451   how many you can toss over your left shoulder into the wastebasket.
452 * Crucify a systems programmer on a tape drive.
453 * Condescend to sit with an end user and discover that the eight programs
454   you've spent months working on do not in any way, shape, manner or form
455   produce meaningful results.
456 * Leave the office, and take a brisk walk in the fall sunshine.  Upon your
457   return, discover that the system came up as soon as you left, but is now
458   down again.
459 * Speculate freely on office pomances and designate the recipients of the
460   Mary Cunningham/William Agee Award.
461 * Dive into the pyramid swamping your "in" box, and uncover all of last year's
462   technical updates.
463 * Browse through the standards manual, and discover that not one program you've
464   written conforms with those standards.
465 * Detach some of the pretty, colored wires from inside your terminal, and see
466   if you can put them back together again.
467 * Reach out and touch someone long distance, using any extension in the
468   dapartment (other than your own).
469 * Cast The Wizard of Oz using members of yoqr department.  It should be easy
470   to find those without brains, without hearts and who nees courage simply
471   by examining the list of executive officers.
472 * Cast Snow White using members of your department.  There is usually a

540 But I don't appreciate depreciation.  Now take my car..... please.  When I
541 first bought it it was worth $4000.00, but now it's not worth what I put into
542 it for repairs.  My mechanic said, "Do you want me to try to repair that thing,
543 or did you bring it here so I could buy the parts."  They say that you can tell
544 a lot about a person by their car.  If that's right, my transmission is shot
545 and my exhaust smells of gas.  I tell ya, the other night I fell asleep at the
546 wheel.  My neighbor came over and released the parking brake.  And the other
547 day I was driving along and a cop pulls me over.  I says, "Whassamatter,
548 officer, was I driving too fast?" and he says, "No, but do you have a license
549 to operate a mobil sanitary landfill?"  I was going to have it washed, but
550 when I got there they told me they wouldn't because the garbage truck only
551 comes on Thursday.  The wanted to know where I placed in the demolition derby.
552 Somebody asked me why I didn't put a stereo in the car.  I told 'em that you
553 shouldn't have a music system in your car that's better than the car.  They
554 looked at the empty hole in the dashboard and said, "Well, your system is
555 matched perfectly."  I tell ya.........
