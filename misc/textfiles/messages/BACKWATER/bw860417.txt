21 -------------------------------The Rat---------------------------------------
22 The Rat thought things faster than he could say them. Wheels were always
23 spinning in his head. If he thought about money or women, you could hear the
24 turning. We heard them turning most of the time.
25     Poured cement and forged iron made the basement smell like an alley fire
26 escape. The only thing missing was the garbage cans, and the peeling paint o
27 the fire escape.
28     His little girl was cooking for us in the house upstairs. We were sittin
29 in the basement, around the radio, waiting for the food. The Rat? He was in
30 the pantry on the telephone. Those wheels were about to spin off the axle.
31     The squeals from the radio got on my nerves. I decided to go upstairs,
32 and talk to the Rat's little girl. She was sweet enough to risk getting him
33 mad. And hell, it might have led to something. "Are you about done there?" I
34 asked the girl at the sink.
35     "About, I'll bring it down in a minute," She was skinning potatoes into
36 the catcher in the sink. I walked up behind her, opened the fridge. "I am,
37 going to bring it down in a minute," The girl was afraid to have me behind
38 her like that. Like I wasn't good enough for her.
39     "Are you going to eat too?" Stupid thing to say. It was about the best 
40 could do with her there. Wither her hair, her dress. Right there! I walked
41 closer behind her.
42     The Rat hung up the telephone, and came out from the pantry. He saw me
43 next to his daughter. The next thing I knew, I was diving onto the linoleum
44 with him standing above me. His daughter was worried about how mad he was
45 too. She left me on the floor, and took the Rat out to the pantry.
46    I heard them laughing later that night. Laughing at me, probably. Damn
47 little bitch! I had to fix them, fix 'em for good. So I asked the boys if
48 they wanted to go out on their own. One or two of them said no, the others,
49 wanted to get the money from the Rat first.
50     The boys and I decided to get the money from him. His daughter would be
51 enough to get it. Not like we never kidnapped anyone before. The Rat had don
52 it too. One day, when the Rat had driven off, we took her. I was the one to
53 nab her, I did it. And liked it.

60 There are laws even Satan cannot break o keeper.  Should he try, his
61 punishment will be yours and you both will share the same fate.  I did not
62 say my knowledge of you comes from Christ or God.  It comes from a source
63 that all must obey.  The universe is filled with laws even Christ and Satan
64 must obey, and from the breach of these laws do I gain my power.
65 No, keeper, death threats do not work for I have died only once and can never
66 do so again.  I am cursed to assassinate those who break The Laws throughout
67 eternity.  You have potential of attaining greater knowledge but a punishment
68 must be extracted for your blatant non-conformity to the laws you MUST observe.

                                           A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT CHRISTIANITY
159 
"I am a good person. Of course I am  not perfect, but I  try
160 o be fair and honest  with people, a good neighbor, give to
161  Salvation  Army, etc.  When it comes right  down to  it,

164  is a common  mistake among  people. Most people  do be-
165 e there is  a God and He is responsible for the creation
166 the universe and he wants  us to be good  people and  do
167  we can to make it a  better place to  live (the golden
168   good samaritan etc.).  If you take such  a view, then

180 A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT CHRISTIANITY
181 "I am a good person. Of course I am  not perfect, but I  try to be fair  and ho-
182 nest  with people, a good neighbor,  give to the  Salvation Army,  etc.  When it
183 comes right  down  to it, born again  christians and I are trying to achieve the
184  goal. It is just put into different words."
185  is  a common mistake among  people. Most  people do believe there is a  God
186 d He is responsible for the creation  of the  universe and he  wants  us to be
187 eople and  do what we can  to make it a  better place  to live (the golden
188  good samaritan etc.). If you take such  a  view, then  Christianity  is no
189 ter than any other religion of the  world. In fact, if I were going to design
190 y own  religion without any knowledge  of  religion,  that's  what it would  be
191   on. WORKS. Do good.  Help  other people.  Have a good  time, but  not  at
192 one elses expense.
193 
Let's  look at  this in  a logical manner.  Most people  would agree that the 10
194 mandments are a  good thing to try  to live  by but do we  live up to it?  In
195 e Sermon on the Mount, Jesus expanded on the commandments and  got down to the
196 motive of the  heart. "You have heard it said 'do  not murder'. But I say to you
197  any one who hates his  brother (fellow mankind) will be judged." Put  your-
198 lf in a degraded  society where it is an accepted practice to kill someone for
199 any wrong to you. Now  you  take away  society's pressure:  consequences,
200 tion,  or possible retaliation. So what would you  do if  someone threw you
201  the corporate ladder  to get points with  upper  management at your expense?
202 he  point that Jesus is making is the  keeping of the law  is deeper  than just
203 rd actions. The law must  be  kept on  the inside as well. It would be good
204 read the 10 commandments  in  Exodus 20 looking  at the heart of each issue.
205 ou shall not covet  your neighbor's  house, wife, standard of living  or  any-
206 that is his." This is
207 rly  a commandment  directed to  the heart and not  specifically  to outward
208 tions. At this  point we need to  take a look  at our own hearts and see if we
209 e up  to  the  standard  of Gods intentions  for  us to live.  We need  to
210 ize that we are  going to stand before the creator  of the universe and tell
211   to  let  us in heaven because we did all that is required for us  to do and
212 ur lives measure up  to His standard. To realize the importance of this we must
213 stand  the holiness of God.  There are two main aspects of His holiness. 1.
214  is a  just God and must punish sin. 2. God is  a loving God and will not let
215 s  creation  die hopelessly  in their sin but WILL provide  a  solution to the
216 ring  condition of mankind. The  just  punishment of God  for the  sins of
217 ind  has been poured out  on His willing Son  Jesus Christ, the only perfect
218 n who kept the law in all parts. John  3:16 says: "For God  so loved the world
219 He  gave  his only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him will not die,
220 ave everlasting life." When one believes in  Him, he  will stand before the
221 ator with  no explanation of his  actions, no excuses, realizing that on  his
222 wn, he has no hope, and say "Your  Son has been punished for my sins". God will
223 ze that His holiness (justice and  love)  has  not been compromised  in the
224 t and will open His arms to you! Now we see  that God is not going  to judge
225 e believer by  how well he kept the 10  commandments, not by anything the per-
226 s done but by whether or not he has believed and trusted in Jesus.
227 
God is  not looking for  people who  want to try to 'get their life together' or
228 le  who think they are good enough without Him, He is looking for people who
229 alize they are not  good enough on their own,  who come - as they are - to Him
230 mit their sin, ask Him for forgiveness, and give  Him permission to change
231 r  life,  change  their heart,  their motive for doing 'good'.  This  person
232 ld be you.

333 Now, the moment you've all been waiting for....................................
334 
335 ( Or maybe nott )
336 
337 Well, here I am again, fresh from seeing the new flick  LEGEND.. and Tom Cruise fans beware. I am sorry to say, that 
338 what looked to be a promising fantasy film turned out to be rather trite and dull. THe plot is dull, contrived, and 
339 mostly just an excuse to show pretty pictures. And that is not to say that the
340 pictures aren't pretty.. For ten minutes at least. The big problem is EVERYTHING
341 sparkles!! At least in the land of good.I estimate four tons of glitter was used in the first half alone. Not to
342 mention the thousand bags of rose petals, fifty pounds of confetti, and twenty acres worth of soundstage. And after 
343 evil suceeds in plunging the land into a season of eternal death: Another truckload of VERY fakey looking, glittery snow
344 Anyhow.. The plot is this. The light of the world is contained in, and guarded by, two unicorns. For Darkness to 
345 suceed and triumph, it must kill these unicorns by way of cutting off their 
346 horns, in which the power of light is contained. Pretty banal stuff. Well, the
347 owers of evil cannot draw the unicorns to them, so they have to follow after a
348 pretty, pure yong princess named Liy, who delays the unico, in which time thepowers of evil drug it with a dart, so 
349 that they can get it's horn. The princess feels understandably responsible,
350 and tries to amend her deed. Well, she along with the remaining, living unicorn
351 get captured by the forces of evil, and it is up to her lover ( TOmmy Cruise )
352 to rescue her.
353 
354 Well, once the film moves into the huge.. ( And I mean HUGE ) tree that serves as the headquarters of evil, things get
355 progressively better. Tim Curry, almost indistinguishable under massive mounts of makeup, is the best of the bunch. But
356 that is to be expected: evil characters are always more fun than good characters. Tommy is helped by some sundry sprites
357 most of whom ( especially two obnoxiously cute dwarves) serve only to muddle the plot. 
358 One pet peeve of mine is when they make a horse look like a unicorn, but they cant quite glue the horn on tight enough.
359 when the unicorn/horse gallops, the horn bounces. A breach of credibility, whatsay? And at times, the makeup Tim curry
360 wears sways suspiciously.
361 
362 In summation, I would say that this film is muddled, good in places, quite good in others, but not really worth seeing 
363 unless you can get in on economy hour. It think the problem is.. LEGEND needs more matter, with less art.
364 
365 P.S.  If someone else had seen it: I would welcome a viewpoint in contrast, or even in agreement, to mine.
366 
367 See ya at the movies (_stolen!)

398     "Yup, Backwater again. Tune in the the correct frequency. Tie the hyper-link up to the trunk line and see if you can
399 get a reading."
400     "Done. Hey Tom, there you are. And boy, what a crazy one. We have ourselves a couple of real winners on here. The
401 machinery is having a difficult time calculating identity probability because the intelligence/capacity readings are
402 too low to detect without removing some of the low-pass DFT's."
403     "Don't bother, it isn't worth it. I'll log the occurrence and send a memo on the readings to command. They'll know what
404 to do about the situation."
405     "What do you think they'll do Tom?"
406     "I don't know exactly Frank, it's not our job to prescribe, only to report. Command knows what they are doing. I am sure
407 these outlandish figures will be bannished soon enough. Go ahead and disconnect the link before their drivel shorts out
408 our equipment. We are protected but this waste material can be very corrosive."
409     "Got ya. And.... finished. I'm changing the regulating freq back to normal scanning mode."
410     "Fine, thanks for the help Frank."
411     "No problem Tom, always glad to help out."

439 Now L'homme...when did you ever see a movie bother with rules??? They'd
440 prefer to insult your intellegence (what little you have seeing as how you
441 went to the movie to begin with :-) har!) and do things because they are
442 artistically correct. Whatever it s that they have determined to be such
443 this week. P.S. I still have that check for you.
444 Regarding Legend... I miss Walt Disney.. now there was a man who knew how
445 to make a good fantasy film. Make it for all time, not just a quick buck
446 at the box office. I think that is what is so wrong with the movie industry
447 today, they don't care about bringing you back for a second viewing 
448 several years down the road. They just put in a bunch of glitter and hype
449 to get yo in the theater that first time and don't care about anything
450 else. Whatever happened to the dedicated directors and actors who cared 
451 about what they were doing? Now everyone seems to be out for the fast buck.

490 All: Indeed there was a 'party' here tonight (the word 'party' in single quotes
491 because there was a total attendance of three- including myself.  Four, after
492 my roommate arrived).  L'homme and Voyeur arrived shortly after 7, mainly
493 to discuss a possible (highly probable) storyline.  L'homme also took the
494 opprotunity to pass his critical eye over my collection of cassettes.  Pizza,
495 potato chips, apple juice, and various other consumables were promptly disposed
496 of.  If for some reason *you* couldn't make it, well, perhaps another time.
497 Net 06 was kind enough to encipher my phone number and address for the agents
498 in that organization.
499 Now my home-away-from-parents is offically "housewarmed".
500 +++++++++++++++++
501 "Yes, man in blue clothing.  That is a polratscha, a common edible plant."
502 "Edible for you," I replied.  At last I knew why the alien affected Cragmore
503 so.  The cellophane cactus must be related to the crystal trees in the
504 Diamond Valley!
505 Argentium lay at the heart of those plants.  The silver metal was a natural
506 source of energy of all sorts, but in living beings, usually boosted psi-level
507 tremendously.  In natural psi-talents, that is.  In a being with no such
508 talent, Argentium produced mental static.  No wonder Cragmore was in such pain!
509 And why I was recovering at a fantastic rate.  Being what I am, I may restore
510 myself directly using the silver metal.  Now, how to be rid of it....?
511 "Straxi, inside that plant is a silver substance.  Is it vital to your
512 metabolism?"
513 The alien thought for a few moments, his face-analog twisting strangely.
514 "No, it is a... useless substance that must be consumed with the rest."
515 Thank Amigc!  This might just work...
516 I put away the 3x5 cards, and instead brought out my travel book.  How I manage
517 to put all of the things I do into my robes is a story of itself, to be told
518 another time.  In a few moments, I had located the spell for which I searched.
519 "Polyandi Uhgdur Basomku Zilgend..." I began, motioning with my hands as I did
520 so.  A dim white glow flickered between my palms as I formed a little ball of
521 silver material out of the clorine atmosphere.  Or seemed to.
522 When I finished, a small sphere of silver lay in my palm, and the Argentium
523 within the plants and the alien was gone.  This is what Cragmore had sensed.
524 Sharp pain showed in his face when he gazed at it.  Now, how to dispose of
525 this gleaming sphere of pain?
526 I studied Bard, who poked through the wreckage of his transport.
527 "Bard," I said quietly with my palm extended, "With this I can move your
528 transport to where it can be repaired, and perhaps what remains will pay for
529 the repairs, as well."

551 Dear L'homme: They are lovers not in the crude, modern sense, but in the pure
552 sense of an innocent world. The unicorn is trapped by the princess simply 
553 because she, a mortal,dares to touch it.As for good old Walt: Some may be out to
554 make a fast buck, but he has secured much more. He has secured immortality. Did
555 you know that Fantasia was a box office flop, as well as Alice in Wonderland?
556 Did you know that critics panned Sleeping Beauty? Things that can survive trial
