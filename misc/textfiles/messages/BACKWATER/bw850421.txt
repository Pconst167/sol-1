22 L'homme: Sorry to have missed you at what was probably the last informal
23 Backwater Irregulars meeting at PC&S, but since my ride has set times to
24 arrive and leave, I had to go.  TTYL on PCS, no?
25 Piper: Don't let those music-haters at PCS get you down, I enjoyed what little
26 you were able to play.

29      Victor and Ashley held each other close and kissed... gently at first,
30 then with more passion.  Another episode of the Young and Restless faded to
31 black.  Dr. Frankenstupe snapped off the television and sighed to himself,
32 "Gosh, I enjoy that mushy stuff."
33      "Ahem, I do believe you're an incurable romantic."
34      "Why Sigmund, I didn't hear you come in.  Please sit down."  
35      Sigmund settled into an easy chair and said, "Doctor, I understand you
36 finally went to the PC&S tavern and met some of the Inn patrons."
37      "Yes, I was a touch nervous at first, but soon relaxed and enjoyed
38 myself."  Frankenstupe said.
39      "Were the patrons what you expected?"
40      "I really didn't know what to expect.  I found them all to be very
41 individualistic, creative, and intelligent.  I met some old foes, Joshua
42 and Leonard, who turned out to be rather nice.  A couple of the strong
43 personalities, the Guardian and kathyd, were quite charming.   Mad Max was
44 well... Mad Max."  Frankenstupe turned wistful for a moment.  "Piper and
45 MiG were there, too, but I didn't get a chance to say hello, but overall,
46 it was fascinating."
47      "No regrets then?"  Sigmund asked.
48      "Well, there was one person missing.  Someone I still want to meet."
49      "Ah yes, I know who you mean."
50      "I'm sure you do.  Maybe someday..."  Frankenstupe became lost in 
51 thought.  Sigmund smiled to himself as he left he room... and the Doctor
52 was left to his daydreams.
53                                             Doctor Frankenstupe
54 P.S.  Guardian and kathy d:  It seems I have been gulled by the vandals and
55 compounded my error by engaging my typing fingers before using my brain.
56 Sorry about that.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to try and get this egg
57 off my face.                                     Dr. F

91 Ah, it is indeed sorry to hear about the possible ouster of the PC&S, 
92 although I may not have attended there more than twice now, I am indeed
93 sorrowed to hear about it leaving.  The information concerning Piper
94 being asked to de-pipe himself was especially heart-breaking.  I enjoy
95 pipes what little I have had the opportunity to hear, and am astonded
96 that they would do such a thing with such a large clientle that seemed
97 to be quite infavor of them.  Things do seem to be going downhill these
98 days.  My life as well as everyone else have taken a turn for the worst.
99 Maybe its just Halley's Commet (you know that Cybermen have planted a
100 bomb in Halley's and its going to hit us).  An interesting thought no
101 doubt.  I attended the Doctor Who Convention held saturday at the Benson
102 Hotel and the people to Portland who like the Doctor really turned out
103 for the convention.  They had some 500 chairs in the ballroom and it was
104 standing room only!  Being early we got great seats at about row 5.  It
105 was really neat.  Why in such a block form now?  I'm really not sure.  
106 Maybe I just wanted to save the space.  Who knows.  KATHY:  sorry for
107 not having any oreos in the house, Mike had already polished off the
108 last bunch that was in the house and I have not bought any more at the
109 store.  Again, Sorry.  I'm also somewhat sorry that I have not been able
110 to call BWMS as much as I use too.  I do enjoy all of the stories that
111 are placed upon these disks for everyone to read, such a neat board.  I
112 am glad that Mikey decided not to throw in the chips several months ago
113 when the big scare hit about shutting down.  My Mike and I are really
114 moving in strange and different circles these days.  Each of use I think,
115 thinks the others circle is bad for them.  But then again.  I don't
116 know, I'm so confused these days.  But then again, Such is life.  Well
117 I've taken up enought of the most important boards time and space.  
118 Especially the space part.  I think I'll go read a bit of B before wandering
119 off to something else.  Then again, you never know.  To all of the
120 Inn folks:  Please, I raise my warm mug to you all, and my hats off to
121 all of the wounderful personalities here at the Inn.  It is a most needed
122 place for you.  To each and everyone of you, I hope you find your true
123 self, at the Inn.                    May the blessing be.

126      "I love breaking tough guys."
127      Mohammed peered into the glaring light of a powerful hand lantern.
128 Silhouetted there, he saw several figures.  One towering over the rest.
129 "Colonel Igor Dorkonovich, I presume."  Mohammed said.
130      "Very good, Wassir."  Dorkonovich stepped into the circle of light.
131 Clad in a dull green uniform, the Russian stood 6'7" and weighed 280 lbs.
132 Short bristly hair covered his head.  He stared at his captives with beady
133 pig eyes... eyes full of hate.
134      "Colonel Dork, what happened?  You give up mud wrestling for an honest
135 job?"  Ming's wisecracking helped cover his fear.
136      "Ming Louie, you have taunted me for the last time."  Dorkonovich 
137 smiled in anticipation.
138      "Wassamatter Dork, Natashia complaining about your limp noodle?"
139      Dorkonovich reddened and sputtered in rage.  He complusively clenched
140 and unclenched his fists.  Mohammed worried that the Russian would fall 
141 into one of his infamous rages, spoke to break the tension, "Colonel, I
142 must congratulate you on finding us.  Since we are at your mercy, may I
143 ask how you accomplished it?"
144      Dorkonovich flashed Ming a look of hate, then turned to Wassir, "Why
145 not tell you?  Our operatives in Inisfall have reported that Pam has been
146 kidnapped.  Not our operation, I'm afraid.  But I knew you two would hurry
147 out of Afghanistan to rescue her."  The Russian puffed his chest out 
148 proudly... smug in his logic.
149      Ming and Mohammed looked at each other in amazement.  "Pam kidnapped?
150 So that's what Salazar wanted.  Hmmm... I wonder who?"  Mohammed said.
151      "Not that you can do anything about it now, Wassir.  I have a recep-
152 tion waiting for you in Kabul.  Nothing fancy, but several of my men want
153 to discuss tainted borsch with you."  Dorkonovich smiled, revealing large
154 yellow teeth.
155      "I told you not to put saltpeter in their borsch, Ming."  Mohammed
156 said to his friend.
157      Ming shrugged and said to the Russian, "Sorry about the borsch, Dork..
158 but we can't stick around to discuss your sex life."  Ming took two steps
159 forward and sprung high into the air.  His left foot lashed out, the 
160 booted toe caught Dorkonovich full in the mouth.  Teeth and blood sprayed
161 into the Asian night.  Before anyone else could react, Mohammed scooped up
162 a fist-sized rock and with one smooth underhand motion hurled it at the 
163 hand lantern.  Glass shattered.  The scene plunged into darkness.
164      Mohammed and Ming urgently began to scramble up the jumbled mountain-
165 side.  The eerie strobe of Russian submachine gun fire lit their path.  The
166 confused shoutsw of pursuers followed them.
167 
168      Their climb spurred by fear and the angry whiz of bullets 'round their
169 heads, Ming and Mohammed soon reached the lofty mountain pass.  Cautiously
170 peeking from behind a boulder, they saw a Russian helicopter sitting in a
171 large open space.  Two uniformed soldiers looked uncertainly from an open
172 hatch, roused by the gunfire.  They died with soft grunts, Albanian 
173 throwing knives in their throats.
174      "My friend, can you fly this thing?"  Mohammed asked uneasily as Ming
175 settled into the pilot's seat.
176      "Hey, piece of cake.  You're in the company of a proud graduate of the
177 Montgomery Ward Correspondence Helicopter School.  Hmmm... now how did that
178 go?"
179      Mohammed's next words were lost in the roar of engines at the heli-
180 copter rose unsteadily into the sky.  It climbed higher, then began to
181 gyrate wildly.  Mohammed blanched as they plunged toward the rocks below.

200 Dr. Frankenstupe et al: you just missed meeting your old friend Petrov at P
201 C&S - he was up from OSU for the weekend, but had to study.  You could have
202 had an interesting meeting, talking about the similarities between the
203 care and feeding of sheep and Things.  If you make another appearance (and 
204 if there is a place toto make an appearance at), perhaps you'll have 
205 another chance.  As things stand, he won't be back on a PorSFiS weekend 
206 until the summer, but things have a habit of changing.

231      Thenan was on the bridge, along with everyone else, when the Jeluni made
232 planetfall on Lucabethu.
233      The Jeluni had been on a routine planetological expedition when it was 
234 diverted by an urgent request by the sector councel on Decimelu.  University
235 research vessels are not usualy used on a mission of this risk but her crew 
236 weren't exactly first year students and no other was available.  While it is 
237 true that Thenan was doing post-grad in galactic nav at the University of Na-
238 bathebe which owned the Jeluni, the course and the trip were mostly a sabatical
239 for him, away from the rigors of elected servitude as a Lananaran coordinator.
240      Captian Rica, herself experianced in xenozoology, was nominaly the ship's
241 master.
242      The landing sight appeared to be a natural amphatheatre.
243      One of those ubiquitous four wheel boxes with arms, cameras, a panoply of
244 sensors and compartments for spy-eyes and microbots, which Lananarans refer to
245 as a masterbot, was sent out to sniff the air and generly test conditions 
246 before any of the crew could be permitted to risk exposure.
247      Not that Lucabethu wa a totaly new or unexplored world, mind you.  Its 
248 just that the current population was falling!  Indeviduals vanished into thin
249 air, often as not in the presence of friends and neighbors.
250      A frantic call to the sector capitol had resaulted in the Jeluni's div-
251 ersion.
252      The precautionary masterbot reported back nothing obviosly worrisome or 
253 contrary to the old report that been filed prior to colonization.  One 
254 puzzeling find was the faint trace of an energy field they were unable to 
255 catalogue.  Its traces dicepating immediatly, precluding the taking of more 
256 precise measurement.  A glitch perhaps, within acceptable noise levels.  The 
257 anomily was duly logged and forgotten.
258      Assigining Lejab, engineering joat, and Lala, propulsion systems, to 
259 ships watch, the rest of the crew, in light protective gear, truged up out of
260 the bowl of thair landing site.

273 =================================================================
274      It had been hard keeping track of the black car as it speed 
275 thru traffic. But it's destination was becoming clear, it was 
276 headed towards the airport. I was not prepared for when it 
277 deverted to the air freight company entrance, and almost lost it.  
278      I stopped just outside the gate, then pulled in and parked 
279 in the customer lot. The limo I had been following continued 
280 around the office building, and headed towards a hanger in the 
281 back. Getting out of my car, I ran after it. 
282      A security guard stepped into my path. "Hold on there! Where 
283 do you think you're going?" He shouted. "Out of my way! Police 
284 business", and I flashed him my fake Police badge that I had 
285 gotten out of a box of Cheerios. That seemed to satisfy him, and 
286      I speed on. As I rounded the corner of the building, I saw 
287 them pulling the young lady out of the back of the limo and drag 
288 her towards a 707 jet that was being pulled out of the hanger. I 
289 waited until they had entered the aircraft, then quickly sprinted 
290 towards it. 
291      The engines had already been started, and the ground crew 
292 were taking the gear back to the hanger. The cargo hatch hadn't 
293 been closed yet, so I quickly climbed in and hid behind a crate. 
294 Moments later, they closed the hatch and I felt the plane begin 
295 taxiing. 
296      I pulled out my pocket scanner and turned it to the local 
297 tower frequencies. I was rewarded with a message moments later. 
298 "Roger November charlie one seven zero, you're cleared for take 
299 off, for Denver." 
300      Oh wonderful, I'm going to regret getting involved with 
301 this, I thought. I crawled over to the radar transmitter and 
302 pulled the air exchanger exhaust hose off. That should give me a 
303 little pressurization and heat. I poked around in the cargo, and 
304 found a sleeping bag. I unrolled it and crawled in preparing for 
305 a long cold flight.
306      "Why do I get myself into these situations?" I said to no 
307 one in particular.

314         Away from the realm of fine satin cloaks, rawhide jackets, and an occasional feathered hat exists what may be
315 called the Real World; a place of denim jeans, polyester & nylon, and baseball caps.  This is where we were today 
316 (yesterday, Sat 21 Apr), and this is where we may possibly no longer meet.  What I mean is that we could have just 
317 looked at our last day spent together within the Inn incarnate, the place we have at one time or other been to or 
318 heard mention of.  This is a place we have known as the friendly  PC&S Tavern.
319         At first it was intended as a simple meeting of minds, a meeting for friends.  We didn't know what we had in   
320 store for us.  It started something like this....
321         At about two or three in the afternoon, a couple of friends walked in off of what were the drizzling streets 
322 of downtown Portland.  As they strolled by the barren and half filled tables it became apparent that they had arrived  
323 ahead of the crowd that made it a habit to congest the back tables during their biweekly visits.  Seating themselves
324 somewhat stategically, they began to give the menu the once-over for a bite to eat; in an effort to make it to the 
325 event on time they had both missed lunch.  As they were reading up on their choices, a third person came in and was
326 seated.  It was at about this time that their cordial host approached the table and began with his lighthearted
327 barrage of  "So what'll it be this time?"  inquiries.  Since the fellow taking our order is usually in good spirits 
328 and lets the feeling show, we almost shrugged off a comment he made about the apple juice.
329         "I'm sorry, but we just ran out of the last of it, and haven't reordered since we may be shutting down."
330         "Oh, you're closing down, are you?" came the casually jesting reply.
331         "Yes, we are....."
332 
333 
334         He then proceeded to inform us as to the reasons of the situation.  It appears that their ten year lease is 
335 due to expire at about the end of the month, and the organization that owns the building, the German Aid Society, does
336 not wish to have it extended.
337         Shortly after having been served our meal with side order of bad news, more than half dozen Patrons came 
338 through the door to take their places in this day's meet.  They were filled with smiles and chatter, expecting to 
339 regale in conversation that may be so rarely shared with in person between a mojority of these individuals.
340 Some small talk,  and some not so small talk had been flying through the air for quite awhile when all of a sudden it 
341 was all cut short by a tremendous wailling came from the center of the establishment.  It was now very clear that that
342 the character of high repute had once again been able to survive a voyage into the heart of the city.  
343 Yes, the piper's creator had returned with bag in hand.  After the initial shock had died down, and a couple of   
344 "isn't that?"  and  "I told you so"'s were passed on the crowd began to resume the ordinary din to its original level.
345 But after a short pause, just long enough to attach the bag to the mouthpiece (ecuse my lack of proper terminology),
346 the piper rose and began to play a melody that would have been intended to lift the sagging atmosphere that 
347 accompanied the news of the forthcoming closure.  It was getting everyone's attention, and it was going to work but a 
348 wrench was thrown in the works of this as well.  There had been a request (or even a complaint) that it would be 
349 better if the pipes were not to be played.  How stunningly ironic.  It seemd that not only the structure that held the
350 allure of the Inn was gone, but the spirit of it was dying as well.  There were many that were watching with an eager
351 eye and a hopeful ear to partake in the merrimemt that could in some way transfer them mysteriously back to the other 
352 realm, another reality that is Inisfal.  It was not to be, the hope was cast aside.
353 
354         After awhile the Patrons and other guests started to disperse to the places they needed to be.  Some left 
355 early and others lingered on for prehaps hours.  A few faces that were (almost) new t the crowd had voiced their
356 name's and proclaimed their identities that covered them by pen and keyboard.  Some were able to rattle off three and  
357 more names while others only mentioned that they had one or remained silent as to the possibilities of their other 
358 selves.  There were two men that sat next to each other that commented under their breathes to each other that they  
359 could both take credit for more than six or seven personas of their own.
360         Things settled down after some time, but the gloom that the meeting place may very likely be closed before our
361 next visit has haunted me to the point that I knew I had to be the one that made this statement.  Fragments were bound
362 to have been mentioned, but they needed to be pieced together.  I only hope I haven't missed anything.
363 Having heard the names mentioned, I could list them off by organization or reality but will just leave you with this.
364                                                                     Piner.

369 NEWS ALERT -- NEWS ALERT -- NEWS ALERT -- NEWS ALERT -- NEWS ALERT -- NEWS ALERT
370     I'm sure some of you well remember the likes of one Captain Barefoot.
371     (aka. alchemist, Mesolithic Mathematician, Melissa, and heaven only
372     knows what other various Inndentities) If the rumors I hear are true,
373     few have seen his physical presence outside the Backwater Inn. I'm
374     not sure if he still visits here (lurks) or not. Knowing that I place
375     myself at risk of his double bladed wit, still the news must be told.
376     Thumbing through an early edition of the Monday Oregonian a feature
377     article in the Living Section catches my eye. If my memory of things
378     told here at the Inn are correct I suspect the person referred to is
379     none other than the captain himself. (Sorry if I gave you away Capt'n,
380     chuckle, grin.) Can you BELIEVE it?????
381     For obvious reasons this alert is brought to you sans byline.

386   The room as too small to be comfortable.  The only light was directly over 
387 the table, striking the dark tabletop like a fist.  Reflections of its impact
388 lit three of the faces at the table with an erie half-light.  These three had 
389 papers spread before them, the whiteness of them harsh in the brillant light,
390 making their faces clearer in the gloom.
391   All three were smoking, their ashtrays overflowing.  One butt had even rolled
392 unnoticed to the floor, its fire now slowly dying.
393   The forth man leaned back from the bare table in front of him.  His face all
394 but invisible in the darkness.  A narrow cane hung from the arm of his chair.
395 He was not smoking.
396   The paper on the table were spread about in frantic patterns.  Bright evidence
397 of some lengthly if not fevered activity.  But for this moment nothing moved in
398 the room.  The eye of the storm.

	RE: Future Employment Opportunity
417 
	Dear Mr. Salazar,

418 	You have been recommended to me by a mutual business acquaintance,
419 	a Dr. Frankenstupe, with whom I and my clients have done business
420 	with in the past.  He has given me the utmost assurances as to your
421 	professionalism as well as your ability, and therefore I am taking
422 	this opportunity to contact you in regards to a certain event that
423 	may have a bearing on specific highly profitable business ventures
424 	in which I am engaged.

425 	It is my belief, as well as that of the local constabulary, that one
426 	of my clients may have recently been the victim of foul play.  It
427 	has been reported to me by usually reliable sources that it is highly
428 	possible she has been illegally detained, and may in fact now be in
429 	transit to a South American country of unknown origins.

430 	Enclosed please find the vital statistics of the individual above
431 	mentioned, as well as some past history and all other evidence and
432 	names of which I am aware that are pertinant.  Also please find a
433 	retainer in the form of a check for expenses that you may incur in
434 	the course of your investigation.  It is my hope that you will find
435 	the sum adequate for your needs, but you will find my office to be
436 	available to you if this is not the case.

437 	I will assume that your standard fee schedule will be in force for
438 	this particular venture.  We find this completely satisfactory, and
439 	you will also find receipt of a handsome bonus on the successful
440 	completion of this employment.

441 	Sincerely,

442 	R. Rommell

450      The Sentry awaited to be relieved from his evening post by yet another
451 member of the guard.  As time passed he realized that something must be wrong,
452 his replacement hed never been this late before... it was almost sunrise.
453 Keeping duty in mind, he ramined at his station.  Thoughts of his fellow 
454 comrades filled his mind, as well as the ebents that had currently taken place
455 both at House and in town.  Trying to make himself more comfortable, he tugged
456 at his chain-mail and repositioned the sword he carried at his side.  Since the
457 sun was on the rise, he extinguished the torch mounted in one corner of the
458 small shack he had occupied for the night.  He breathed a heavy sigh.
459      #They'll hear about this!# he thought.  #But since the commander hasn't
460 been seen for days, things haven't been thm same around here.  'While the cat
461 is away...' I suppose.  But still, why has he beeen away for so long?#  He
462 crossed his arms and gave a puzzled look to the empty walls.  #I wonder.# 
463 The sun rose and filled the shack with shades of red, gold, gren and black.
464 The torch had been put out and the Sentry was wide awake, just waiting... 
465 <<<<<----------------------------------------     The Sentry     ----------<<<<<<<

467 	"Mr. Salazar?" said the figure emerging from the doorway.
468 	"Yes." Salazar tensed. Since the abduction he had been expecting 
469 further trouble.
470 	The man held out a small plastic card, about the size of a credit
471 card. "You're investigating Pam's kidnapping." It was a statement not a
472 question. The man continued, "you may run into a marked lack of co-
473 operation in some quarters. This'll help. When you're done, call the
474 number and they'll tell you what to do with the card."
475 	Salazar took the card, looked at it and froze. He looked back
476 up and started to ask a question. But the man was gone.
477 	He looked back at the card. He heard of the CIA using cards like
478 this in Vietnam, but this somehow didn't have the right 'feel' for a
479 'Company' job.
480 	He read the card,
481 	"Do not detain or in any way interfere with the bearer of this 
482 card." and a phone number in full international direct dial format. On
483 the back were a magnetic strip, some bar code and a long string of
484 numbers and letters.

489   The Cathode Plate; episode 2:
490      The story they got from the local councel of coordinators, though more 
491 detailed than the origeonal request for diversion, was no more enlightening.
492 Most of the vanishings, as the locals had started calling them, happened eather
493 less than a hexichron after dawn or a similar time before dark.  None of them
494 inside anyone's home, all of them in a small number of precise locations, many
495 now known and marked off, yet the vanishings went on.
496      Several sites were visited, each properly protected by saw horses, 
497 surveyor's tape and blinking lights.
498      Toward evening, crew having parted company with local coordinators, were
499 on thair way back to the ship.  Rica and Nica, who were walking on ahead, 
500 didn't see it start.  Thenan, who was at the rear, saw in detail.  Captain and
501 science 'supercargo' turned at his call.  Just in time to see Cila fade from 
502 translucence to transparency to not there at all!  Only Thenan had seen the 
503 faint blue aura that surrounded her immediatly before she began to faide.  
504 Nica, a grad student in xenogeophysics, took a reading with her kit.  The 
505 resaults were oddly similar to the mysterios field glitch encountered shortly
506 after landing.
507      Next day, Thenan returned to each site, including the one tragicly dis-
508 couvered the previos evening.  He checked for evidence of field generating 
509 equipment and for subteranian cavities below or nearby.  No such luck.  On his
510 way back back to log this dissapointing failure, as he approached the ship, 
511 he stoped ware the Jeluni'S masterbot first noted the odd field effect.
512      Right away a cavity registered.  He sent for the masterbot which cleared
513 away a few centimeters of top soil to reveal a cast stone hatch of some sort.
514 It took Lejab's diverse background to puzzle out the opening mechanism.  When
515 the ship's engineering joat finaly slid back the couver, a virtical shaft 
516 with mettal grab rungs down one side, was revealed.

519 There's this beast that grew in my head
520 Today I'm calling him Fred
521 He directs me 
522 Almost constantly
523 Like a steering wheel in my head
524 
525 He looks out through my eyes
526 He wears me as disguise
527 I tried to tell her
528 Frighten 'er, warn her
529 To mess with him is not wise
530 
531 He fits tight inside my skin
532 I feel dry, streached thin
533 I feel like a drum
534 The downbeat to come
535 I sit in my head and watch him
536 
537 He took my woman tonight
538 He made her scream in the night
539 He laughed in my face
540 As he took my place
541 I could not take my eyes from the sight
542 
543 I watched the light in her eyes
544 And listened to her sighs
545 And I saw her face
546 As he started to place
547 His hand between her thighs
548 
549 He liked me watching him
550 I felt him grin a grin
551 He smiles with grace
552 From inside my face
553 He knows I won't fight him and win
554 
555 He takes her and he laughs
556 For he sees shadows pass
557 Across my face
558 As I watch her face
559 As the two become one mass
560 
561 He watches for my expression
562 Some reaction to their obsession
563 I try to trace
564 No sign in my face
565 To reveal my opression
566 
567 I don't want him to see
568 How much he torments me
569 He'd rub his hands
570 And dance in the sands
571 Of my head, and laugh with glee
572 
573 There are secrets that he tells
574 That he whispers in my halls
575 When I try to hear them
576 He hides in the bathroom
577 And mumbles in the stalls
578 
579 He is like the shark
580 That cruises throught the park
581 By day if you meet him
582 You don't even know him
583 But you buy his drugs after dark
584 
585 Now he lives in my head
586 Controling everything said
587 If you should meet me
588 Look closely
589 
590 
591              you might see
592 The beast that I call Fred
593                                                the harlequin
594 +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +    +
595 \`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\
596   Three faces turned toward one.  As the silence lengthed the cigarettes
597 moved more often, leaving smokey contrails in an arc between mouth and
598 tabletop.  The draws were more pronounced, the exhales more like sighs.
599 Small beads of sweat could be seen on three upper lips.  One cigarette was
600 extinguished, another imediately lit to replace it.
601   The figure at the head of the table stood and walked to a switch on the 
602 wall.  He did not use his cane.  He limped on his right leg.  As his hand
603 touched the switch a low rumble could be heard and th layers of smoke began
604 slowly disappearing through a grill in the wall.  There was a moment of 
605 hesitation from the table, then three cigarettes were ground out of life.
606 There were none lit to replace them.  One pack, a book of matches tucked
607 into the plastic wrapping, was relagated to the breast pocket of a jacket
608 hanging off the back of a chair.
