28 Suddenly the lights blaze on to find PAM looking down on the sorry
29 state of affairs in the old little used room.  There in a jumbled pile
30 on the floor was a mixture of broken table, chair, glass, and Tarn.
31 Grasping his left foot and moaning, with tears streaming down his 
32 cheeks. PAM chuckles a bit at the sight knowing that more hurt was done
33 to pride then body.  Just then another patron rushes in and pushing PAM
34 aside moves to help poor Tarn to disentangle himself from his self made
35 trash heap.  For heavens sakes she cries to PAM, "Get a decent chair!
36 Can't you see he's hurt?"  A low moan escapes Tarns lips "Emer?"
37                             * Tarn *

39 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
40 The piper smiled as the bard finished a song.  Another person took the 
41 floor!  A happy, smiling woman that the other patrons addressed as Pam.
42    She seemed to be lively and bright, and brought a general air of warmth
43 and gaity to the group.
44 

After Pam's song, the piper turned to the apprentice:
45 "Sir, I am certain that we are not acquannted within any other universes
46 with which I am familiar.  As myself, I am but newly formed in this universe
47 in which we do converse.  Here I represent the fusion of logic and emotion
48 for which the person with whom I share a different identity on a different
49 plane of existance -- has worked quite hard in the past.  That person has
50 had very limited contact with persons who participate in the activities
51 of the SCA, to which I assume you are referring.  Sorry to sound so stuffy
52 and formal, but here, I am I, and there, I am that person.  I do not wish
53 to allow the two an indiscriminate mixing, for I would not wish to draw
54 the attention of Mr. Owens to such an unfortunate circumstance."
55   "However, friend apprentice, I am overejoyed to make your acquaintance,
56 and hope that such a meeting can in time ripen into full friendship!"
57 
58 Smiling to soften any roughness that might have confused his tounge, the
59 piper stepped out and winded his pipes. 
60    The drones slipped into synchronization quickly this time. Hmm... thee
61 thaa ... a quick run of the fingers...
62 that chanter reed was about to go.  Oh, well, it should last the evening.
63 Such is a piper's lot-- much time making painful sounds while breaking 
64 a new reed in, a short life while it has become sweeet and easy to blow,
65 and then it is blown out and useless, exept as a pattern for a new reed.
66 
67    Slipping into a soft lament, the piper lost himself in the revery of
68 his song.
69 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

71 ...  T.P.W.E.B (cont)
72 ... after taking a long slow drink and a scan of the gathered
73     group, the strange bearded newcomer continued.
74 	


Nila looked around at the assembled wise men. She hadn't known
75 	there were so many. They were a little intimidating to Nila so
76 	dignified in their robes of honor and golden badges of achieve-
77 	ment. Great thinkers were there, whose names she knew with awe,
78 	though she didn't know what exactly it was they thought. There
79         were philosophers and astrologers, mathematicians and professors,
80 	writers of fact and fancy alike. The more she considered their
81 	learned somber faces the more confused she became. She couldn't
82 	think of a question she could ask. Finally she just blurted out
83 	what was on her mind. "But why are there so many of you?", she
84         cried.
85 
86         At this the wise men began to confer among themselves in low
87         voices, ignoring Nila all together. At last the oldest and wisest
88         of them stepped forward. "Beautiful princess", he said, "the
89         answer to your question is this. We are many because Truth is
90 	many. "But surely", Nila said, "If there is one among you who
91 	knows Truth, he alone is sufficient to instruct me. The rest
92         of you can go home and quit standing around then." The philos-
93         opher cleared his throat, "umm!, no my dear, you don't understand
94 	yet, you see there are many, many truths and each of these
95 	revered gentlemen is in posession of one humble part. By
96         combining all our knowledge and wisdom perhaps you may arrive
97         one day at Truth. Of course, he added, only after years of
98 	arduous study and calculation, correlation and confabulation.
99 
100 	Nila thought about this then shook her head sadly. "Compared to
101 	your wisdom I am ignorant indeed and I do not wish to be an
102 	obstinate princess of the kind one reads about. But I know,
103         rising from deep within me, that the Truth I seek is not many
104 	things, but only one thing. It can't be put together from a
105         bunch of parts like some broken toy and I do not think it can
106         be distributed like hot buns among many men." This caused a
107 	stir among the wise men and Nila caught the ocassional flicker
108 	of a glance, sometimes thoughtful sometimes admiring as their
109 	discussion proceeded. Finally the philosopher left the group
110         and bowed deep before Nila. "Beautiful Princess", he said,
111         "you are more wise than any of us for your search begins where
112 	ours ends. We only ask that if you succeed you will return and
113 	instruct us. With this each of the wise men bowed deeply 
114         before Nila and left the room in ceremonious single file in
115 	order of eminence. When they had gone, Nila sat down at the
116 	foot of the throne and tears came to her eyes. However, in
117         the natural course of events her sadness vanished completely.
118 	It was a beautiful day at the palace, as always, and she 
119 	thought she might take a walk in the garden before trying to
120         figure out what to do next. From that direction she heard a
121 	faint humming sound, like the sound of bees seeking nectar.
122 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< to be continued >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
123 
124 	He shook his head and smiled. So d was in a playful mood eh? Pulling on his
125 beard!  Apparently she had forgotten that apprentices are famous for their 
126 mischevious nature. He'd have to remind her.......
127 	First, however, there was another matter to be taken care of. "Piper? I have 
128 no wish to contradict thee, but I must say that the fault was mine. It was I
129 who first brought up the ...  shall we say, the matter better left unmentioned?"
130 	He and the piper bandied the matter back and forth in a friendly manner until 
131 the piper's next set.
132 	While the piper played, the apprentice was apparently idly doodling on the 
133 table with some of his cider (spilled when his beard had been tweaked, no doubt)
134 If any one had been paying close attention, they would have noticed that he was
135 reciting something under his breath. The only word that was intellegible was 
136 "Maxwell".
137 	Having finished, he smiled and his eyes were focused on what appeared to be 
138 empty air. He inclined his head towards another table and his eyes appeared to 
139 be following something as it flew(?) across the room.
140 	He called the innkeeper over and slipped him some coins, with a whisper.
141 He sat back and grinned, wondering how long it would be before d noticed that 
142 her mug was always full and always at EXACTLY the right temperature. Behind the
143 counter, the innkeeper just shook his head with a wry grin.
144 ................................the apprentice.................................
145 To the worried persons:	I am very careful to restrict the amount of space *I* 
146 devote to songs on a disk. I can only hope others will do likewise.
147 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
148 		I Dream of Unicorns (words: Teri Lee, music: Catherine Cook)
149 My brothers dreamed of spaceships and fighting men from Mars.
150 Of building giant ringworlds, and flying to the stars.
151 	But I dreamed of unicorns and centaurs sleek and wise,
152 	Pegasus, the phoenix, and cats with golden eyes.
153 
154 But mostly I found soldiers or Conan with a mace,
155 Robots by Asimov, and Heinlien's ships of space.
156 	But I dreamed of unicorns and centaurs sleek and wise,
157 	Pegasus, the phoenix, and cats with golden eyes.
158 
159 I spent my childhood searching for fantasy and dreams.
160 They told me I was foolish, but still it always seems
161 	That I dreamed of unicorns and centaurs sleek and wise,
162 	Pegasus, the phoenix, and cats with golden eyes.
163 
164 The tales and songs I longed for weren't on the bookstore shelf.
165 I guess they are the stories I'll have to write myself.
166 	For I dream of unicorns and centaurs sleek and wise,
167 	Pegasus, the phoenix, and cats with golden eyes.
168 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
169 	As I finish the song, I observe various reactions. Some are puzzled by the 
170 unfamiliar references. But I see that others are nodding as if in agreement.
171 Good, it had been a risk to sing such a song here, but perhaps it will have 
172 been one worth taking.

175 LEONARD:
176 Hmm...Mr Olson, huh? Don't recall anyone getting called Mr 
177 before. Wonder if that's respect, sarcasm, or a sign that I'm 
178 getting old. Whatever. 
179 
180 Sounds like JDH or McLaren. The politics of which kids get put 
181 in institutions is ridiculous. I won't ask the particulars of 
182 your experience, but I can imagine what happened. It's a 
183 strange juvenile system we've got. Not a particularly good 
184 one at that.
185 
186 You certainly survived it admirably. You impress me as some-
187 body whose got his head pretty well together.
188 
189 Speaking of heads.
190 
191 You impress me as having adopted a very rational approach to 
192 life. You often create verbal images of "insufficient data", 
193 "guidelines", and other such rational imagery. You appear to 
194 be very logical.
195 
196 I wonder if there is a philosophical base behind 
197 rationality. What books, or thinkers, or experiences 
198 most influenced how you perceive life. 
199 
200 What do you see as the essential nature of man.?
201 ================
202 GENERAL:
203 "Set goals for myself few mortals would dare". Surely you 
204 don't think I'm going to let that one go by.
205 
206 OK, General, tell it like it is. What goals have you set, 
207 how did you accomplish them, and what is the philosophy that 
208 sustained you in these pursuits? Do you feel a sense of 
209 personal destiny? Tell us about it.
210 
211 Your attitude towards life sounds familiar but I can't quite 
212 place it; a bit of Neitzsche perhaps?
213 
214 Tell us more.
215 =============
216 Debbie:
217 Got your note. I'll get the "Nuts To You" stuff in the mail as 
218 soon as I can. The money wasn't necessary, but thanks.
219 ============
220 Leonard & the General: The foundation of my own personal 
221 philosophy is the belief that it is the lopesided man who runs 
222 best on the sidehills of life. This is the philosophical 
223 principle that guides my life, as it obviously does for other 
224 patrons of the Inn. 
225                      Gary
226 P.S. - Enjoyed talking with everyone. Take it easy and enjoy 
227        life when you can.

232      IT HAS BEEN A LONG NIGHT, BUT ENJOYABLE!  STANDING OUTSIDE OF THE INN,
233 I LOOK AT THE MOON AND STARS, AND GAZE AT MY SURROUNDINGS WITH A SMALL SENSE
234 OF LOSS.  I'VE LEFT A SMALL SPRIG OF ROWAN WITH DEAR CISTOP, AND UNKNOWN TO
235 HIM I HAVE PLANTED A ROWAN TREE BY THE ROADSIDE AS A GUIDE TO ME WHEN I NEXT
236 RETURN.
237 
238      AS I BEGIN THE WALK DOWN THE ROAD, I FEEL THE PRESENSE OF BHARNAE.  "SO
239 WHERE WERE YOU ALL EVENING?" I ASK, WONDERING AT THE SLIGHT SMELL OF WINE
240 THAT ACCOMPANIES HIM.
241      "Well, I've been in the cellar with the resident Cluricaun, a nice old
242 elf named Moderagh."  THOUGH I KNOW HE MUST HAVE IMBIBED GREATLY, THERE IS
243 NO SLUR IN HIS SPEECH OR TREMBLE IN HIS GAIT. "We merely sampled the wares
244 of the Innkeeper, and left some of our own in payment."
245      "I, TOO, TOOK PART IN MORE REVELRY THAN IS NORMALLY MY WANT, AND I DID
246 ENJOY MYSELF!"  I AM LIGHT AT HEART, DESPITE KNOWLEDGE OF MY CURRENT PATH.
247      "Yes, I heard your song.  And how could I fail to notice the Rowan?  Do
248 you now not wish to travel the road you're chosen?"  THERE IS SYMPATHY, AND
249 SOME PAIN, IN HIS TONE.  "Such as this can be hard for a mortal, and for a
250 woman in particular."
251      "NO," I ANSWER, "I'VE CHOSEN THIS PATH, AND I WILL TRAVEL IT.  I MERELY
252 THINK THAT I WILL MISS MY FRIENDS, AND THE INN.  BUT I KNOW I WILL RETURN
253 WHEN I AM DONE, AND I KNOW THAT TIR-NA-N-OG MUST BE A COMELY LAND."
254      "It is, and you will learn much.  Come, the night is growing old, and
255 we must meet at the Faerie Hawthorn!"
256 
257      WE WALK THE ROAD TOGETHER, AND THOUGH I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT LAY AHEAD,
258 I THINK OF OTHERS WHO HAVE ALSO FOLLOWED THE HAWTHORN.  PLEASE, DON'T LET ME
259 LOSE TRACK OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME...

263 SIR OLSON:
264   AS YOU KNOW, GOALS COME IN MANY FORMS, AND GROW WITH THE INDIVIDUAL.
265 ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SMALL ONES, I RECALL THAT THESE WERE (ARE)
266 THE MOST SIGNIFICANT.  THEY GAIN IN LONGEVITY AS WE GET FURTHER ALONG.
267 AT FIRST GLANCE, THEY MAY SEEM TRIVIAL OR FANCIFUL, BUT CONSIDER HOW
268 MANY PEOPLE (ASIDE FROM OUR GOOD FRIENDS AT THE INN) HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
269 THEM:
270   *DEVELOP INTO A PERSON I CAN RESPECT, WITH NO "MIGHT HAVE BEENS"
271    TO CLOUD THE PERSONALITY.
272   *OBTAIN THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE, TO FULLY DEVELOP INNATE
273    TALENTS AND ABILITIES, AND MINIMIZE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WEAK
274    SPOTS.
275   *WORK AS HARD AS NECESSARY TO RETIRE BEFORE AGE 30.
276   *DEVELOP AT LEAST ONE NEGLECTED TALENT TO PERSONAL SATISFACTION.
277   *ORGANIZE, FUND, AND COMPLETE A LUNAR MINING STATION BEFORE TOO
278    OLD TO VISIT IT.
279 OK, THAT'S WHAT I AM DOING.  HOW ABOUT YOUR GOALS, SIRRAH?

284 	     Marcus spent the next seven years much as a small boy would
285 on any world.  He went to classes, slept in the creche with the
286 other children and the guardians, and played games.  Only the
287 games were changed.  The older children, those who'd been
288 initiated and had broken through the shell of their senses to 
289 become Aware, were fiercely competetive with their newly
290 acquired senses.  Their games were more like throwing darts, blind-
291 folded, or sneaking back into the commissary without being seen
292 or sensed by anyone.  Going somewhere without being seen was a
293 major feat on Ankira.  With a whole planet full of room, Marc
294 could never understand why they all lived in one crowded
295 settlement.
296      he didn't see Ben again, as he guessed it, for three or
297 four years, until one day he appeared again in the hall as
298 they were returning from the playgrounds.
299      "Marc!" he called, "Is that you?"  The almost adult-tal
300 boy stopped, eyes wide with surprise.
301      "Ben Avery! Hey, wehre've you been? I started thinking
302 you were Watching me again or something."
303      "No," he laughed.  "those days are over. I've been on 
304 Journeyman status in the Cluster. You should have known that."
305      "Well," Marc gestured, "it has been a long time, and you
306 know how they keep you cooped up in here.  But no matter.  Tell
307 me about Outside!"
308      For once Ben's face lost its familiar joviality and looked
309 pained, as if some hidden facet of his life had just emerged for a
310 moment, then resubmerged.  he looked Marc in the eyes for a moment,
311 considering his words.  This was a familiar trait with Ben, then
312 he spoke in low tones, "They're sad and lonely and they hurt each
313 other.  They're just people."

316     Inspector Salizar rubbed his fingers across the cool, oily
317 metal of his service revolver nervously.  There had been nothing
318 here in Marakesh, no one would talk, and then Serena had called
319 saying she had found something, and would be at the hotel in
320 an hour.  That was three hours ago.  He flicked the safety on
321 and off repeatedly, and lowered his chair back down on all four
322 legs.  He was seated in the corner, facing the door.
323      Suddenly, so quickly that even his trained reflexes took
324 time to respond, the door burst almost from his hinges, the
325 lights went out, and a burst of flame and white smoke obscured
326 his vision.  Blindly he began firing into the smoke, his
327 nervousness taking hold as he emptied the entire clip into the
328 dark doorway.
329      When the smoke began to clear, all he could see was Serena's
330 lithe form stretched out on the floor in the entrance.  At the sound
331 of an ominous 'snick' from behind, he turned suddenly.  Barely 
332 silhouetted by the dark outside, a black, robed figure stood before
333 the open window, a long, dark sword emerging from its sheath like
334 a living, hungry thing....

338    He had been following this roughhewn forgotten path since dawn.
339 Its ceaseless lacing back and forth across the spine of this craggy peak 
340 had tired the sailor. He paused to quench thirst and reflect on his journey
341 ....He had followed the instructions that the parchment had offered...and
342 the map he had discovered was as accurate as any pilot chart he had ever
343 seen. He had followed the stream and never, for a moment, let it from his sight
344 for that phrase he had read still rang strong in his ears........
345   "Mark well the streams passage. The answers only it will provide. "
346   "Follow it until the gorge and their thy path will lie"
347    He had reached the gorge the day before and had swam in a languid pool at
348 its base. It had been there that he had found the lace ....another gift from
349 the stream ....As he walked from the pool holding the damp fabric he discovered 
350 a much overgrown staircase that lead from the pool to the side cliffs.
351  
352 .....Taking another swallow of his water he put his flask into his rucksack.
353 Leaning on his staff he massaged his knee and admired the rowans fine carving.
354 How fortunate he had been. With a sigh he started walking ...letting
355 his strides become regular....He knew the top was near.....
356 ......
357 ..........After many hours travel and the sun low in the sky...He reached a
358 landing . From there the path lead downwards. He decided to camp there for the 
359 night. To the east he could see the streams course through the trees....
360 as it made its way defiantly to the sea....
361 And at his feet ...the gorge...to the west ...following the gorges path it 
362 seemed that stream again joined the surface.... and hidden from sight behind a 
363 bend in the stream ..Was what looked like a whisp of smoke....rising above the 
364 trees.....Another travler he thought...
365 ..And just before the turn in the stream...a bridge....How odd he mused .
366  Taking his rucksack off. And sitting with his back to the cliff. He closed 
367 his eyes ...for a moment..and let his mind drift......Softly the sonorous and
368 plaintive chords of the pipes entered his mind and he began to sleep........

380 Pushing away from the desk in his office in the city, he pauses for
381 a moment to think about dear Pam.  He feels she must have missed
382 the note he left on the table a day or so ago.  He fels a sadness, as ~
383 he did not get the chance to tell her what had happenned.  
384 He winces at the thought that she might think his establishment
385 closed forever, when it is in fact being merely remodeled, with
386 new tables and fine services installed for all of the patrons.
387 He opens a drawer and looks inside, just making sure it is still
388 there.  He sees the disk of wonderful and wise utilities and programs
389 is resting quite so, waiting for a place to go and be useful.  Ah, fair
390 Ms. C.  You have done me a disservice in being frightened of me.  I
391 carry nothing with me to be fearful of!  Underneath the business veneer
392 veneer lies a playful, fun loving nature.
393 Oh well.  Perhaps she will want it when she returns.
394 He closes the drawer and goes quietly ack to his work.
395 The lights burn late, for there is much to be done.

420 Ah, the dear inspector was rattled indeed if he fired a full CLIP from his 
421 REVOLVER! I don't mean to gritch, but please be more careful. I am careful about
422 what *I* do and do not put into my "on-line fiction". I have referred to magic, 
423 but I also made sure I followed accepted practice and procedures. (I know some
424 people who practice various forms of magic.) I don't know if it "really" works, 
425 but I treat it as if it does. I even consult various references.
426 I must also add that I have some familiarity with some forms of martial arts & 
427 with some things oriental. Your ninja should have a Japanese name, NOT a Chinese
428 (Bad Chinese, at that). 
429 	I'm impressed with your characters and writing, so I am leaving this msg.
430 Not to rake you over the coals, but in hopes that you will become even better!
431 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
432 Gary:	I'm not really sure where I got my principles, etc. I have read Heinlein's
433 books (and Norton's, and...). Almost all the philosophy I have read was "sugar-
434 coated" in one SF novel or another.
435 	I've made mistakes all right. Hoo boy, have I! I've learned from most though. I
436 do have some unusual spots in my background though. I'm single (never married)
437 yet I've helped raise a kid. I learned QUITE a bit from that. I don't think I
438 made as many mistakes as my mother did, but only time will tell.
439 	Actually, most children seem to start out being logical & then the adults 
440 confuse them. Most of the "silly" ideas that I've heard from kids (Patrick, & 
441 several others I used to babysit for extended periods) are just logical 
442 deductions or inferences based on insufficient data. If adults keep going "where
443 did you get that silly idea" instead of talking to the child & explaining where 
444 he went wrong, it won't take long for the child to decide that logic doesn't
445 work in the adult world (sometimes I think they are right, but that's a 
446 different topic).
447 	Rule #1 for dealing with a kid. Do NOT treat any child who is old enough to
448 talk in a manner that YOU would not wish to be treated. At the same time be 
449 ready to treat HIM the way he treats you and others occasionally. 
450 (the first insures that you will treat him as a PERSON. The second insures that 
451 he will treat others as persons.)
452 	My talk of "insufficient data" and guidelines stems from personal observations.
453 It's too easy to pigeon-hole people -- in the WRONG hole! As an example, when I 
454 was in the 4th grade I was tested. They were trying to decide whether I should
455 skip a grade or not. The final decision was: No, he might not get along with the
456 older kids. Unfortunately, they never stopped to consider whether or not I got
457 along with my "peer" group!

460   A shrill whistle echos thru the Inn causing the patrons to hastily
461 cover their ears and glare at this person who would disturbe them so.
462   Emer who was so bold to try to garner the Inn keepers attention
463 thus then looked around for surly he would be on duty at this hour.
464 Yet he was nowhere to be found.  So she must accept having her thrist
465 slaked thru the service of PAM instead for now.  "Where has the dear
466 Innkeeper gone off to now?" She asks of PAM.  "Duty calls, and I'm
467 afraid he will be late again tonight.  Leaving me to run things while
468 he's gone.  He damn well better pay me overtime this time!" She mutters
469 under her breath as she moves to serve another waiting patron.
470   With that Emer leans back on her chair balancing it on the two rear
471 legs and enjoys the atmosphere of the Inn.
472   Far away a figure trudges on towards the Inn his black cloak wrapped
473 tightly around him to ward off the chill of the night.  Though the
474 distance had seemed short before, now it was an endless eternity to
475 travel.  He must hurry to reach the Inn for fear of missing his new
476 found friend Emer, and the minutes seem like hours, every stone an
477 obstruction to his path.  Though the time is late he hurries on.

482      You seem to have some ideas for Inspector Salazar.  Be my guest and
483 continue with the tale.  Just don't kill off dear Alberto, I've got some
484 ideas I'd like to use with him.  Also there might be a lot of me in him,
485 and I'd hate to lose him.

496      The Inspector swallowed with a dry throat as the hollow click
497 of an empty chamber seemed to fill the room.  He pulled the trigger
498 once more just to be sure, or out of reflex, hope.  Same click.  The
499 dark figure advanced slowly, seeming to take pleasure from Salizar's
500 helplessness.  Then the light from the open entrance was suddenly 
501 blocked, and a voice rang through the room.
502      "Salizar, down!" the man yelled.  Alberto sprang backwards and
503 turned simultaneously, only glimpsing the tall blocky figure raising
504 an Uzi into firing position.  The act seemed to flow in slow motion
505 as the gun barrel raised, and then steadied as the Inspector reached
506 the floor.  But the gun never fired.  Just as he steadied himself,
507 two small daggers seemed to appear in his arms, and he spun, fell.
508 Salizar had just enough time to see the Ninja raise that sword for
509 a final blow when....

545      The evening is long, as is my patience.  I know that Tarn will arrive
546 for our scheduled appointment, will come sometime during the long eve, and I
547 will continue to search for him between pulls at my glass.  Perhaps by the end
548 of the night he will come, but will I be in any condition to speak to him by
549 then?  This wine is strange to me, with an odd but lovely flavor.  I have never
550 had its like.  I wonder if there is any more, this bottle is empty.  Where is
551 Pam?  Was that her leaving?
552      Ah, Pam!  More of this wine please!

556 Over in the corner, behind a post, where it is usually very quiet, where the
557 lurkers often sit, a large bearded journeyman looks up from his work and calls
558 for a refill of the dark sweet beverage he has been sipping.  After muttering
559 something about "the real ting" (sic) he rises and walks over to the Piper.
560 "I beg your pardon for this interuption but I could not fail to hear what you
561 and the other said.  Your words raise old memories better left dead, but I fear
562 that they will not sleep again."  the Piper nodded and asked him to continue.
563 "I am now known by a name which is a jest of matters technical (a disturbance on
564 the 67 line of a machine that processes information), but once I was called
565 Yngvi, and sometimes crazy.  When last this subject was discussed,  the world
566 went from gunpowder to wooden clubs in three seasons. if we must do this again,
567 I point out that Nuclear Weapons may act as a reminder of our folly.
568 If you have the courage, Piper, and think we may benifit from the wisdom of
569 the young ones who know not the passions of their fathers, write the words
570 that all agreed where correct on the slate on yonder wall."
571 With this the bearded one once known as Yngvi, that some once called crazy,
572 returned to his place to sip the sweet, dark liquid.

576 Pam was halfway through her belated breakfast when the idea came to her mind.
577 Although she knew operational characteristic as well as she knew her own
578 body, it seemed strange to her to see the semiconductor protruding from her
579 navel.  She thought about it for a while and then finished her meal.  After
580 all she was just a women.

584 Rushing towards the Inn, for now he was very late, Tarn flings open the
585 door striking a patron who was standing too close, learning the leason the
586 hard way about hanging around too close to the door in a public place. 
587 Muttering his appology, Tarn seemed little interested in the poor patrons
588 plight other then that he was not seriously hurt. Searching the tables
589 Tarn begins to worry, "Have I arrived too late?" 
590 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
592 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
593      In  the  wee hours of the morning while speaking to Emer  of 
594 many things past shared and otherwise,  Tarn felt himself growing 
595 sleepy  and  before he knew it he soon was fast asleep  with  his 
596 head in his arms.  A smile played across his face in a sleep that 
597 for the first time in ages was not troubled.   Looking upon  Tarn
598 with  a kindly gaze,  Emer pulled Tarns cloak over his shoulders, 
599 Then lightly Kissing him on the forehead quitly slips out of  the 
600 Inn into the still night air.  A smile on her own face.

604      It seems that either Pam is sleeping on the job, or has left the Inn
605 for a while.  I guess this table will have to be cleaned by someone else.
