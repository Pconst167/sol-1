23    Morby ate his meal slowly and without interest.  After he had finished he
24 and Dawg went into their room to grab some esentials, including his sword. He
25 left the Inn and went to look for the book worm fellow.  After a bit, he found
26 the Lazy One under tree, absorbed in a tome of some sort.
27   " Sorry to bother you like this, but I'd really like something to read.
28 Maybe something on the art of wandering, or something on that line."
29   The Lazy One glanced up, and then a look of comprehension appeared on his
30 face.
31   "  How about a comprehensive text an thieving talents?"
32   "  Down my alley...sounds wonderful."
33   The book materialized before his Morby's eyes.
34   "  If you would please sign it out...I don't like losing my books."
35   Morby went through the process of signing the book out, and looked for a 
36 place to read.  After some looking around, he settled for a patch of grass
37 next to a tree, and with Dawg's head at his feet, he began to read.

39   Sorry if I used your character incorrectly, but I wanted some interaction.

44 ... a man of amazing stature and an absolute evil look about him entered.  He calmly looked about, and said in a low
45 voice, "Danger Room?"  Milchar and the Doctor exchanged worried glances, and silently agreed.  "Lead on." 
46 The two travellers turned about and lead the man through a maze of tunnels, corridors, and side passages, untuil at
47 last they arrive at a set of double doors of massive size.  "K-9, activate the Dager Room, Danger Level 'Maroon'.  
48 Validation code: cheeseburger."  K-9 replies, "Room activated, confirmed validation code.  Room is now LETHAL, Master."

70     Or will be heard.

78   I stir the ashes in the hearth,

82   While dust and ashes yet remain

101 The three fighters move to the opposite sides of the large hexagonal chamber, the roof being easily 300 yards high
102 and the diametercould just as easily be over 200 yards.  Trees, bushes, even a river decorate the scene, the illusion
103 of which is only ruined by the whirr of mdeath machinery sliding into place.  In the center of the room is placed the

120 Shtoner:  if you are an alter-ego of a pre-existing BackWater Innhabitant,
121 I will assume that you are merely trying to disguise your identity.
122 If you are a truly new visitor, here's a short explanation of how the Inn seems
123 to work.  It has cycles.  For a while, it is mainly fantasy, essentially a verbal
124 D&D game; sometimes good, sometimes not so.  Currently we seem to be in the
125 mediocre mode.  After a while, the pendulum swings, and the bulk of the messages
126 relate to something "relevant".  Usually it ends up being a 'discussion' of religion. That's when a person named Aaron becomes
127 active, also the few female members are heard from then too.  Other topics such as anarchy are tried, but somehow also end
128 up being about religion.  That finally dies down, and the multi-authored
129 stories start up again... If you see one going that looks interesting, figure
130 a 'logical' way of joining in (logical within the bounds of the story, anyway).
131 If you want to try something different, try offering a story line.  Someone
132 might also find it interesting, and pick up on it.  Luck!
133 :::::::::::::
134 Milchar: a very intriguing story you have going.  Is it based on something
135 in particular, or is it entirely invented? 
136 Are the weapons controlled mentally; the arena a miniature world (the gods playing at war?)
137 Do you have any idea where it's going, or are you just 'winging' it?  I'm interested.

143   Far away from the familiar haunts of the inn, the piper was travelling a very
144 strange path.  His kilt was stained with travel, and his brouges dusty with many
145 miles, but his step was steady.  The path shown beneath his feet with a steady
146 silvery light, sparkling up as his feet lightly scuffed the surface.  Above, in
147 negative, shown the image of the path.  
148   As he walked, his pipes carried at his side, the very air about him seemed to
149 flash and change with his motion.  Occasional side roads would appear, and he 
150 would peer down them, shake his head, and continue.  Once, he seemed ready to 
151 go to the end of one side road, but the golden collar shaped like a dragon that
152 encircled his throat pulsed a warning at him, and he turned back to the main 
153 path.  Finally muttering "I've got to get some rest somewhere!", he took a 
154 likely looking side path.  As his feet left the main pathway, the continual
155 flikering slowed, and it seemed that he moved through three-dimensional images
156 that shifted abruptly as he travelled.  He stopped once or twice and examined
157 the scenes he saw, but moved on quickly.  
158   At last he came to an unoccupied meadow with a small brook bubbling through 
159 the center of it.  Moving as though down a steep hill, he stepped into the 
160 meadow -- the shining path disappeared behind him.  Evening was just falling in
161 the meadow, the piper quickly made a fire, stored his pipes in a fabric cover to
162 protect them from the damp, wrapped himself in his plaid to protect himself 
163 from the gathering chill and toasted a half-loaf of bread over the coals.  
164 Taking a large chunk of cheese from his sporran, he propped it on a framework
165 of twigs near the fire.  As the heat melted the cheese, he scooped it with 
166 toasted morsels of the bread.  After eating his fill, the piper returned the
167 bread and cheese to his sporran, took a drink of water from the brook, then
168 came and sat by the fire.  Streching out, he began to wonder what had happened
169 with his friends at the inn.  What strange creatures had come in that weather-
170 beaten and weapon-scarred door?  What strange fluids had been passed over that
171 blackened bar-top?  As he speculated, he became aware of thin, colored, gauze-
172 like filaments filling the air.  Idly, he reached out his forfinger and spun a
173 green-colored one around it.  Looking at the colors, he felt a slight resistance
174 as he dropped off to sleep.

181    It had been a long voyage and many diverse realities since the ancient
182 practitioner had seen his friends, of that convoluted eddy known as "The
183 Backwater". First there had been the trans-time, cross-discipline, enrichment
184 conference. The King, of course, had insisted that there be a representive
185 in attendance. Considering most of the papers that were read, he suspected
186 the reasons were more political than academic. Really, a two hour treatise on
187 determining the artistic or intellectual bias of the individual, based on
188 whether they install the roll of toilet paper in the holder with the loose
189 end rolling off the front or the back. The trip, however, had not been void
190 of merit. In his discussions with other attendees he had picked up a paradox
191 or two. "A Pair of Paradoxum", now that had a multitude of possibilities. One
192 of the items was the funniest joke ever told. There was one slight problem.
193 When someone heard it told, they laughed so hard that they died laughing. How
194 one can learn the story, and remain in existence was a story in itself. Maybe
195 the folks at the Inn would find it amusing. He had set sail for there some
196 days previously, but a great deal more water would flow under the keel before
197 he made landfall again. 
198    As he stretched out on deck in the tropical sun, his mind ranged out to
199 pick up any hint of mental activity. What was that? ## ~~~~~~~~~  @^@^%@!%#*&
200 ----- _______ ++++ ******** [][][][][ jjjj pppppppppppp... ## He sat up quite
201 suddenly, his mind spinning wildly. There was a great familiarity to the
202 pattern. Perhaps, if he brought his own mind to a more precise focus... With
203 that thought he relaxed and surrendered himself to the gentle swaying of the
204 boat's motion.

285 read "Reality 76". Under that a small sign proudly displayed the message, "Best restrooms for terrestrials of any kind"
286 We pulled into the station, and a strange attendant walked up to us and said, "What'll it be boys?" "Premium leaded please"

293 Just when the book was really getting interesting there was loud commotion
294 over by the door of the inn. Irritated the lazy one looked up just in time
295 to see a semi-seething mass of protoplasm on horseback attack one of his
296 new friends. Reacting quickly for one of his temperment, he sat back and
297 thought for fifteen minutes, ignoring the fight except to casualy float
298 aside from the combatants as they rolled around on the ground. Finally 
299 making up his mind, he waved and a new book appeared floating slightly above
300 the other book. Mumbling to himself he flipped pages until he located the
301 proper spell. Ah, oh protean one, since you like to fight. The lazy one 
302 made some gestures with his hands and fingers, joints popping like fat on
303 campfire. Suddenly the raging fighting mass of whatever began to shrink
304 Smaller and smaller it (grew?) changing shape all the while. Ten minutes
305 later it had turned into an extremely viscious and active shrew. Go find
306 some other world to fight on, the lazy one said as the shrew disappeared 
307 with a pop. That spell will wear off in a few days but it may take him 
308 longer to find his way back from that world.

341 The jets spewed out thin streams of universal solvent (Guaranteed to dissolve anything when the component parts are
342 mixed together!).  The solvent falls, and Milchar fadses for a moment as a stream of the stuff slices through the

344 Meanwhille, The Doctor was also having problems- Two of the vesta-cannons had decided to obliterate him.  Drawing out
345 his sonic screwdriver, he dodged yet another blast that almost knocked him over.  Leaping to the wall, he uses the 
346 'driver to open up one of the cannons, using the brush for cover.  Working frantically, he severs the control module-
347 and then, with a flick of the wrist, enables the 'LOCAL AIMING CONTROL'.  Operating deftly, a few wires here and there
348 crossed, The Doctor leaps aside as the cannon again activeates, now homing in on The Black Guardian...
349 ...who is busy gesuturing  a spell, in hopes that it will destroy some of these play-toys so he can get down to business
350 with the others.  A streak of light flows from his outstreched finger... to strike a cannon on the far wall.  The

353 In a nearby empty room, a CRT flashes dimly as sheer destructive power is unleased below.  The words found on the 
354 terminal say:
355 DANGER ROOM ACTIVATED-  AUTHORIZATION CODE !MAROON!
356 RULES:  NONE, EXCEPT THAT THE COMBATANTS MAY NOT LEAVE UNTIL ONE IS DEAD.

360 HAWTHORNE: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO, BUT

362 BESIDES ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS, IT ISN'T VERY POLITE.

365 The Doctor searches through his coat for his Danger Room Remote Control Module.
366 "Milchar, how many times must I tell you that we only kill if absolutely 
367 necessary!!!  Ah ha!  There it is...One flick of the switch, and...There we go.
368 Milchar, head for the door while the Black Guardian's busy!!"  The Doctor and
369 Milchar jump through the door and shut it.  As they do, they see the Black 
370 Guardian jump for the dootr(to no avail.).  "Head for the control center.  We'll
371 give him a run for his money!!!"  "This ought to be fun!!!" exclaims Milchar.
372 "K-9, override the present Danger Room program running, and give me full con-
373 trol of the room."  "Affirmative, Master...Completed.  Danger Room in your full
374 control.  Activating main viewing screen."  The screen slides up to reveal the
375 Black Guardian standing in the midat one edge of the Danger Room looking about 
376 wondering what happened.  He then lookks at the center of the room and sees the
377 Amulet of Zelgar and the Key to Tinme.  He runs for them.  When he is about 10'
378 away from them, The DOoctor flips a switch, and they dissapear.  $This isn't 
379 fair, Doctor!!!$  "Look who's talking" replies The Doctor.  I knew from the 
380 minute you entered the Tardis, that you didn't have the Key with you.  You see
381 I expected something like this from you, just as you should have expected some-
382 thing like this from me."  The Doctor turns to Milchar, "Well, should we give
383 him Danger Room Sequence #152?"  "Which one is that, again?"  "Surely you 
384 remember that one.  You helped write it!!!  It's the Dimat Sequence."  "That's
385 cruel...I like it!!  Go for it."  The Doctor then starts key the sequence while
386 at the same time, he tells the Guardian:  "We hfave a very special sequence that
387 we'd like to test out on you.  You don't have much choice.  You know we don't
388 kill, but this sequence will make you wish you were dead...Milchar, key it on 0
389 Ready?  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.  Key it NOW!!!"  Milchar keys it in
390 and the Danger Room roars to life.  In the center of the room stands the figure
391 of a tall, white bearded, powerful man.  The Black Guardian looks up and then
392 screams in terror....

396 back at the inn, pheric foerender,confused at all the attacks and to-be attacker
397 s. opens his pouch and draws  out a ybow(he could shoot it better than a gun)
398 and a quiver of 50 arrows,then walks out and quietly sits down and waits.
399 (maybe for giant ants?)he hasa feeling that danger is near, but what could
400 it be?he wonders.as he is waiting he idly chews on a blade of grass.he see's

407   HAVING RESTED MUCH ON THE LONG, SO FAR REALITIVLY UNEVENTFUL
408 RIDE, DREAMTOUCHER FELT MUCH RESTORED.
409   AS THEY APPROACHED THE EXIT ITSELF, BARD TOLD L'HOMME;"THIS LOOKS LIKE A 
410 LIKELY PLACE.  
411   THEY LEFT THE BROAD, SMOOTH, TRAFFIC FILLED ROAD BY WAY OF THE CURVING
412 EXIT, THE ONE LABLED BABILON BUISNESS LOOP NORTH.  TO DREAMTOUCHER
413 THIS WAS A NEW LAND OF MANY WONDERS.  AFTER PASSING FOUR OR FIVE
414 WIDELY SPACED SIDE STREETS, THEY PARKED UNDER THE OPEN SHELTER PROJECTING
415 FROM A SMALL SHELTER.  OTHER CARS PULLED UP AND PARKED IN LINE
416 BEHIND THEM.  ABOVE THE BUILDING ON A TALL POLE WITH AN OVEL OF SOME 
417 UNFAMILIAR TRANSLUCENT GLOSSY MATERIAL NEAR ITS TOP.  ON IT WAS PICTURED
418 IN A CONTRASTING COLOR OF THE SAME ODD STUFF (VOYER TOLD HIM IT WAS CALLED
419 PLASTIC) WAS A PICTURE OF A FOURLEGGED FINBACK WITH A RIDER WITH WILDLY
420 FLYING POUCH (IMPLYING MOVEMENT AT GREAT SPEED) AND A ROW OF ODDLY SHAPED
421 MARKES (BELOW THE SYMBOL) WHICH BARD TRANSLATED AS: 'PONI EXPRESS GASSAHOL
422 , SUPER FLITE FUEL AND UNTETRATED REGULAR'.
423   DREAMTOUCHER WAS ASSURED THAT THIS WAS NORMAL AND TO BE EXPECTED,
424 JUST WHAT L'HOMME AND BARD HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR, INFACT.
425   THE SCEEN WHICH GREETED THAIR EYES WHEN THEY ACTUALY OPPENED THE DOORS
426 AND STEPED OUT HOWEVER, WAS VERYMUCH NOT!
427   THE LINE OF CARS WHICH HAD JUST PULLED UP BEHIND THEM, NOW COULD BE SEEN
428 TO BE IMMOBILE PILES OF RUST WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SETTING THERE 
429 FOR YEARS, PERHAPS CENTURIES!
430   THERE WAS NO ONE ABBOUT, THE BUILDINGS
431 GLASS HAD LONG SINCE BEEN BROKEN AND VANDELIZED, EVEN THE PUMPS WERE USELESS 
432 RUSTED LUMPS.  INSIDE THE 'STATION' WAS NO BETTER, ONLY THE BUILT IN
433 CABBINETTS REMAINED AND A YELLOWED STAINED MAP LAY IN A PILE IN
434 ONE CORNER WARE THE THUMB TACKS WHICH HAD HELD IT TO THE WALL HAD RUSTED
435 THROUGH AND FAILED.  IT WAS A GRID OF STREETS AND ROADS AND NEAR ITS MIDDLE
436 WAS A LARGE FADDED PURPLE DOT WITH THE WORDS YOU ARE HERE.
437   L'HOMME BENT TO PICK IT UP AND IT CRUMBLED TO DUST IN HIS FINGERS.
438   EVEN THE DUST WAS BLOWN AWAY AND SCATTERED BY THE BREEZE WHICH CAME
439 IN THROUGH THE BROKEN GLASS OF THE DOOR.
440   BACK IN THE CAR, BARD ADJUSTED HIS CONSOLE, MUTTERING SOMTHING ABOUT 
441 GHALDRON-HESTHOR GLITCHES.  DRIVING ON INTO TOWN, LOOK THOUGH
442 THEY MIGHT, NO ONE COULD SPOT ANY TANGABLE SIGN OF LIFE.  
443   CAR GAVE UP, GASPING, OUT OF FUEL, AND HAD TO BE PUSHED TO A CURB.
444   FROM TIME TO TIME, OUT OF THE CORNER OF THAIR EYES, THE ROADWORN 
445 TRAVILERS CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF WHAT APPEREAD TO BE NORMAL SCIENTIENT
446 ACTIVITY.  YET WHENEVER ANYONE TURNED TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT WHATEVER 
447 HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN, IT WOULD TURN OUT TO BE NO MORE THAN
448 A BREEZE STIRRED BRANCH OF TREE OR SHRUB.
449   EVERYWARE THERE WERE TALL BUILDINGS.  THE CITY, FOR INDEED THAT IS WHAT IT WAS
450 , OR HAD BEEN, WENT ON FOR MILES AND MILES IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  SOME OF
451 THE BUILDINGS SEEMED LONG AGO TO HAVE BEEN SCORCHED BY FIRE FROM THE 
452 INSIDE OUT.  MANY MORE WERE COMPLETELY OR MOSTLY INTACT.  FOR ALL
453 THE STATE OF THE PLACE, THE STREETS WERE SUPPRISINGLY FREE OF DEBRIE OR RUBBLE.
454   INSIDE EACH BUILDING INVESTIGATED TURNED OUT TO BE MUCH THE
455 SAME AS THE GAS STATION.  IT WAS ALMOST AS IF EVERYONE HAD LEFT, EN-MASS
456 IN AN ORDRELMANOR, TAKING ALL THAIR VALUABLE BELONGINGS WITH THEM.
457   ONLY AN EMPTY DESK HERE, AN OLD TABLE THERE, IN ONE ROOM A RUSTED
458 BEDSPRING WITH A LAYER OF MOLD WHICH MIGHT ONCE HAVE BEEN A MATRICE.

460   THE FIRST EXCERSIZE FOR THOSE WHO ASPIRE TO DREAMSHAPING IS TO LOOK
461 AT YOUR HANDS WHILE DREAMING.  JUST GO TO SLEEP WITH THE THOUGHT IN YOUR MIND
462 THAT YOU WILL.  IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY BUT SOONER OR LATER IT WILL.

464 PLEASE DON'T EDIT THE ABOVE STORY ENTRY INTO UNINTELIGABILITY
465 AS SOMEONE SEEMES ALREADY TO BE DOING (OR
466 AM I JUST BEING PARANOID ?)  A LINE STATING RUBBLE ET.C THAT THE 
467 STREETS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SUPRISINGLY FREE OF SEAMES TO
468 HAVE ALREADY EVAPORATED.
469 I KNOW YOU (MIKEY) MIGHT WANT TO COMPACT THINGS A BIT.  JUST TRY NOT TO
470 COMPLETELY DELETE THE CONCEPTUAL ESSENTIALS UNTIL BARD, L'HOMME AND VOYER 
471 GET TO SEE THIS AND TELL ME WHAT THEY THINK.
472 THAT GOES DOUBBLE FOR HAWTHORN
473 (I'M NOT ACCUSING, JUST PLESE DON'T!

480 BEEN SCORNED BY OTHERS.I AM NOT A VANDAL,NOR SOMEONE WHO DIRELY FEELS THE NEED
481 TO DECIMATE OTHERS FOR THE SIMPL E REASON THAT THEY ARE DISGUSTE D WITH HIM/HER/

483 SAVING MESSAGES ON THIS DISK.AND NOW ALL CISTOP MIKEY HAS TO DO IS DESTROY THEM
484 PERMANENTLY AND THAT IS ALL.
485   THE FORMER WAS ALMOST DONE IN A REGENERATION.NOT THE ACT OF BE ING AN ACTUAL
486 MOUND OF BLOBBULAR SLOP.HE HAD,A T LEAST AS FAR AS I KNEW NOT EV ENHAVING OF THE
487 STRENGTH NECESSARY TO FIANY ONE IF HE HAD TO,BUT FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES?C'MON!

493   The dawn awoke the piper and he reluctantly unwound the thread that bound
494 him to the inn from his finger.  It had been long since he had looked in on
495 the inn, and saw several new inhabitants as well as several old friends.  Ah,
496 if it were just possible to spend more time, he would like to talk to them all,
497 hoist a few glasses and learn what adventures had befallen in his absence.
498   He sighed, took a lump of waybread from his sporran and made a hasty breakfast
499 washed down with a handful of water from the stream.  He shook the dew from 
500 his plaid, pleated it, then wrapped the end around his chest and fastened the
501 trailing end with a large silver brooch.
502   The first rays of light struck his face, and he looked up at what rose.  
503 Averting his eyes, he shuddered.  He knew he had come a long way, but this
504 was nearly too much to bear!  Longing for the simple light of a sun, he gathered
505 several of the lightly luminous strands in his hands, picked up the wrapped 
506 bagpipes, and took a step away from the meadow now illuminated by a horror that
507 brought the gorge to the back of his throat.  Pulling on the threads as on a
508 lifeline, his steps brought him to the main path and started the air around
509 him flickering like the scales of a gigantic fish.
510 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
511 Hello all, I won't be able to contribute every day as in the past, but I smay
512 be able to keep current now.  If so, I'll try to drop in on someone when I 
513 find out what's goint on.   --piper--

517      WHY IS EVERYONE PICKING ON POOR HAWTHORNE? HE SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A GUY WHO 
518 IS BASICALLY ALONE AND LONELY. WHY IS EVERONE ALWAYS ON HIS CASE? WHAT HAS HE 
519 REALLY DONE TO ANYONE?
520      OH SURE, I'LL ADMIT THAT HAWTHORNE'S SOCIAL SKILLS COULD USE A BIT OF 
521 POLISHING, BUT DOESN'T IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO. I'VE 
522 GOTTEN THE IMPRESSION THE GUY'S REALLY TRYING TO FIT IN. HE'S TRIED TO LEARN THE
523  RULES AND GO BY THEM. I THOUGHT HE WAS DOING PRETTY GOOD.
524      ONE OF CHARMS OF BACKWATER IS THAT IT IS A REFUGE FOR ODDBALLS. I DON'T SEE
525  THAT HAWTHORNE'S ANY STRANGER THAN MOST OF YOU (WELL MAYBE A LITTLE) AND I 
526 THINK HE DESERVES A BIT MORE RESPECT. AFTER ALL, HE'S HARMLESS, HE DOESN'T 
527 VERBALLY ABUSE ANYBODY, AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT HE'S 
528 INTO VANDALIZING THE SYSTEM. SINCE BACKWATER DOESN'T REALLY NEED A SCAPEGOAT WHY
529 DON'T WE GIVE HIM A BREAK?  MAX

532     First this stranger comes up to me, asks me VERY pointed questions, and
533 now he wants to talk about 'arrangements'.  It's about time to say farewell
534 once again.  Wait a sec, is that a drink being pushed my way?  My type of
535 guy.  But it's time to set a few things straight.  "I'm mostly a go-between
536 lately.  I get orders for transportation and selling of goods, and then
537 collect a fat commission."  He looked at my clothes and said "You don't look
538 much like a successful bussness man to me."    "How often do you think people
539 will buy my type of stuff from a guy who dresses good enough to be an agent?"
540     Must be fairly new to this sort of thing.  The questions before giving
541 me his identity gives that away.  Oh well, drinks come seldom my way.  I may
542 as well drink slowly and enjoy it.

546 I WILL WRITE ON MY OWN SLAT 400 TIMES I WILL NOT PICK ON HAWTHORNE!
547 REALY I THINK THE UNEXPECTED SUN MUST HAVE FRIED MY NEURAL CIRCUITS.
548 I KNOW THATS A POOR EXCUSE.  IF ANYONE NEEDS TO APPOLOGISE ITS ME BUT
549 ITS JUST THAT THE COST OF ANYTHING EVEN REMOTLY RESEMBLING SPONTENIETY
550 FOR ME SEEMS TO BE THE RISK OF MAKING SOMTHING OFFENSIVE OF MYSELF.
551 THERE I GO MAKING EXCUSES AGAIN.  WHAT I'M REALY TRYING TO SAY IS 
552 HAWTHORNE COME BACK.
553 I'D SWEAR I SAW A LINE DISSAPPEAR IN FRONT OF MY EYES THOUGH, OR MAYBE JUST GET SKIPPED BY
554 THIS TERMMINAL.  I REALIZE YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.
555 AND WHILE I'M WASTING EVERYONES TIME AND SPACE WITH PUBLIC APPOLOGIES, I 
556 HAD NO IDEA CAR HAD ALREADY PULLED INTO A 'STATION'.  DONT KNOW
557 HOW I COULD HAVE MISSED THAT, I THOUGHT I HAD LOOKED. OH WELL.

563 OK...THE NEW ONE APPEARS. 
564 THERE IS A TALL, DARK FIGURE SITTING IN THE CORNER OF THE INN.
565 HE SITS UP SIPPING AN ALE AND LOOKS OVER AT WISPER. HE IS INTERESTED AND COMES
