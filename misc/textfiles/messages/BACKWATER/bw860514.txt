28 Somewhere in Nicaragua. Friday 00:45
29 Bluefields lies on an inlet of the Caribbean sea, the white sand beaches sheltered from the tropical storms that ravage
30 Central America in the spring. It is swampy, and hot-even at midnight.
31 Hidden under a camouflage net, strung from teak and Balsa trees, a small group om men were chattering casually in 
32 Spanish-the occasional silence punctuated by the slapping of hands on faces and arms-already covered with small 
33 blotches of red. Mosquito Bay.
34    The red star on the vertical stabelizer accented the silver fuselage of the Soviet cargo plane, against a backdrop
35 of earthy browns and greens. It squatted at the end of the landing strip; cargo doors open; hungrily awaiting its load.
36    Three men and a woman stood nearby, speaking in Russian; smoking American cigarettes. Waiting...
37 "El trucca sera aqui en horas kinsey, si?" The uniformed Nicaraguan could just understand the Soviets crude Spanish-
38 irritated that he did not speak in English. "Si, truck here in 15 hours" And they waited....
39                 
40 A light rain was falling over the Pacific northwest, and at ten thousand feet, rime ice was collecting on the leading
41 edges of the wings. Net agent Parity turned the controls over to the rogue agent known as Delta Five, and did some
42 quick calculations on the flight computer. "We have an abundance of fuel. What we do not have is time. Lets get above
43 it." Wordlessly, Delta eased back on the yoke as he touched up the prop pitch and elevator trim.The red and white
44 Dakota climbed slowly above the clouds.
45 Parity switched the Nav-Com to one VOR, then another. More calculations were made. As he started to speak, Leo poked
46 his head into the flight deck, handing cans of cold Bud to the pilots.
47 Delta Five roared in approval;"Hey-you thought of everything!!" The tension was lessened. The six men relaxed. George
48 and Lou had been sacked out for a few minutes; Parity called them forward. "Gentlemen. Flying time is about 14 hours.
49 Given the winds aloft, we may trim an hour off that. Maybe. We'll be at ten thousand-not high enough to require oxygen"
50 Delta cut in-"Only Bud for the pilot..."
51    The flight was uneventful. Almost boring. George and Lou were still awake, and they were playing Poker. Bullets 
52 for chips. Parity was studying maps and weather reports, and handling the ComLink. The auto pilot was engaged, and 
53 there was little for the pilot to do. His mind wandered, thoughts drifting back...to another time...so long ago.
54 He was with Marie. And Tommy. A picnic in the Maryland countryside. Marie, his wife. The afternoon was warm, they were
55 beside a small lake;Tommy trying out the new fishing rod his father had brought home from his last mission. Three 
56 CIA agents lurked in the background. Watching. Protecting. All was peaceful...
57    "Dad. DAD. Help..." In a second the big man was on his feet, yelling at Marie. Then the explosions. Deafening, ear
58 shattering. On and on, and Marie was dead. Tommy was dead. "God, why didn't they kill me too?" The CIA men were gone.
59 The crying, the despair, the liars at Langley. The needles. The escape. The hunt. From Virginia to a Chinese restaurant
60 in Oklahoma to a pizza parlor in Mt. Shasta. The yellow Jaguar. Two men killed in a Seattle hotel. His old friend 
61 Wassir in South America. Phoenix, the Lear jet, a small island in the Pacific with the general, and finally Alaska.
62 And now he was closing in. To find McKane. To kill him... And he waited...
63 
64 Washington DC Saturday. 14:45
65    The presidents apartment is on the second and third floors; luxiouriously appointed in a curious mixture of the
66 old and the new. It was a place of solace, of escape, for the man whose desk was in the oval office. But today-on a
67 Saturday afternoon, it was his prison.  They sat at a small conference table, off the master bedroom. Of the 132 rooms
68 in the White House, this was where the president went to be alone. Today he was not. Across from him sat the Secretary
69 of Defense, and a Brigadier General of the U.S. Army. On the table was a yellow telephone, pads and pencils, and a
70 large aluminum attache case. The lid was open. A yellow light glowed steadily. DEFCON 1. They waited...
71    "Ed, do you really think we did the right thing?" The secretary looked up at the president. "If anyone can pull 
72 it off, these six men can"
73 A soft beep; the General lifted the handset, listened, and replaced it. "They're entering Nicaraguan airspace..."
74 Managua. Saturday. 13:45
75 Managua center Whiskey Echo niner four reporting leaving Vera Cruz at seven. Request PRC and clearance"
76 "Niner four, we have PRC. Welcome to Managua. Turn right to 165, you are 25 miles out, report at 15.."
77 "Roger Manag..   enr.. Ma.g uh...yday ..Mayda.. ..ner four..  ing    down..."
78 Leo worked the frayed cord back and forth as Delta spoke into the microphone. 
79 "Niner four, are you declaring an emergency?" silence...
80 "NOW!" The cargo door was pulled open, and as the lumbering DC-3 approached stall speed, three small wooden crates 
81 and the chunks of wreckage were thrown out. They exploded in a fireball of orange that sent clouds of acrid black 
82 smoke into the afternoon sky. Leveling off at treetop level, the pilot turned right, and headed for Bluefields...
83    The hatch was secured, and the team of men gathered at the flight deck door for last minute instructions. Parity
84 spoke;"We'll be setting down in about 50 minutes. Just before we stop rolling, get the planks out, and under the 
85 wheels, or we may not be able to get out.Then the nets-do the best you can. Use branches, leaves, whatever. Now-every
86 one got their equipment checked?"
87 And again, they waited...
88 "How do you feel, Eric?"
89 "Huh?"
90 "Your'e about to destroy the man who killed your family... What then?"
91 Delta Five looked at agent parity for a long moment, and replied "Here we go" He was not known for raising his voice,
92 but this time he veritably screamed-"Hang on, we're goin' in"
93 A tight right turn, the starboard wing dropping sharply, and the big Dakota flared back, and plopped onto the ground
94 braking sharply, as five commandos threw out the heavy planks and dived after them, onto the grass. Parity-radio in
95 hand trotted alongside the slowly rolling craft.."Goose it", he yelled into the radio. He was answered with a mighy
96 roar from the big radial engines, and the DC-3 rolled onto the wooden beams, the n coughed to a stop. they were in.
97 
98 Delta leaped out the cargo door, holding a parabolic microphone in his hand. He scanned the area, and announced softly
99 "We're alone" The camouflage nets were quickly draped over the big plane, and the team crawled under the port wing 
100 for a quick rest. Parity was scanning NET frequencies on the COMM-LINK. "Nothing. No one even knows we're here"
101 A sigh of relief, a few more minutes rest, and they were off.
102 They fought their way through some of the densese jungle on planet Earth, Delta Five taking the lead. He knew the 
103 jungle. It was his friend. Mosquitos were everywhere, biting exposed arms and faces. They were ignored. Vines tuggd
104 at feet. They were kicked away or slashed with machetes. Tempers flared in the opressive heat, but trained minds were
105 controlled. Delta raised his hand. They froze. A Fer de Lance slithered along the ground in front of them. Then on 
106 again, thorns ripping at their arms; strange shriekink birds protesting their presence. And the relentless mosquitos.
107 Again they froze at the signal from Delta. His hand stayed up, fingers motioning them forward, slowly... Then the 
108 finger pointed ahead and to the right. They all knew. The truck. They could hear the laboring engine a hundred yards 
109 or so, around a curve in the rutted dirt road. "Lets GO!". They crashed through the last few yards of ferns and vines
110 to the road.Parity, Delta, and Lou dashed across to the other side, and dived into the dense foilage. Fellows, George
111 and Leo sprinted up the road, and rolled under a clump of bushes. The truck approached... One shot from Leo's M-16
112 took out the driver, and before anyone could react, Delta was on the running board, and pumped one round from his 
113 Walther into the guards head. Parity dove thru the window and took control of the rolling six-by, braking sharply.
114 A curious face arreared fron behind the canvas back-quickly followed by empty hands, as he was four automatic weapons
115 pointed at his face. Leo barked orders in stacatto Spanish, and a dozen Nicaraguans piled out, hands high in the air.
116 "Alto. Attencion. Aqui, andele andele, "pointing to a small clearing at the edge of the narrow road. "Get their guns
117 look for a radio. Get their jackets. MOVE!" 
118 Fellows looked at the others;"What do we do with them?" George Kellerman stepped forward and answered the question.
119 
120 Fellows felt sick. He showed it. Delta Five felt sick. He didn't show it. "Let's go. Get the rest of those jackets.
121 Check out the truck, we're moving out"   Thirty seconds later they did.
122 
123 the impact of what they had just done-of what they were about to do- overcame all other emotions. they were a team.
124 a well oiled machine with a mission
125 
126 Delta Five was in the passenger seat, Parity was driving, the others in the back, yelling above the rush of the wind
127 as the six-by skidded along the rough road. Ther had donned the jackets of the slain Sandinistas, and again, checked
128 their weapons. A few minutes later, the truck rolled to a stop alongside the Soviet aircraft. Six men leaped out, the
129 Nicaraguan guards were cut down before they realized what was happening. The four Russians were reaching for their
130 weapons, but were too late. Leo had an M-16 pointed at them. The weapons were dropped to the ground. Parity yelled at
131 Lou" hey-look at this! Uzis! The damned Ruskies were carrying Uzis. Anyone got a camera?"
132 A hidden smile, a flash of light. "Yup"
133 The pressure was off, the men at ease. Lax. Laughing, cheering. Lax. "WHOA" "Lets get some guards posted, and get 
134 those crates on board" Parity was yelling as he listened to the voice from the portable radio. "We got company coming"
135 Within minutes, the heavy crates were aboard the aircraft. "What do we do with the Russians?", asked Fellows?
136 Delta replied;"We take them to Disneyland. They're defecting; right Ivan?"
137 The furious Russians, hatred on their faces could only acquiesce; they clamored aboard, as the plane started to roll.
138 Delta Five had many years flying experience, and with Fellows help figured out the controls. The soviet jet raced 
139 along the hard earth toward the free world...Ahead, they all saw it-the winking orange lights of automatic weapons
140 firing at them. George and Lou were returning fire from the open cargo doors as the jet streaked past the jungle 
141 fighters. George screamed at them, questioning their ancestry as he emptied a clip in their midst. Leo cheered- "You
142 got em, Ge---" and as he looked at Lou, fell silently out the door as the Earth dropped away beneath them...
143 Calmly, sadly, he crawled forward. "We lost Leo..." He, Lou and Delta strapped on parachutes and prepared to jump.
144 The silver craft with the huge red star on the tail climbed swiftly to 2000 feet, and circled the open field where 
145 was hidden the old Dakota. A quick farewell, and wishes of good luck, and they were gone. The stolen Soviet craft 
146 streaked into distance. Toward Puerto Rico. And freedom...
147 Three men plopped onto the ground a dozen yards from the hidden Dakota, and-discarding the harnesses, geabbed their
148 gear and sprinted to the plane. No time to hide the parachutes... The nets were pulled away, their gear stowed, and 
149 as Delta started the engines, they piled in and secured the hatch.
150 Delta firewalled the throttles. Boosters on. Carb heat on. Mixture full rich. The mighty engines strained, shaking
151 the craft violently. With maddening slowness, the big Dakota started to roll, slowly gathering speed. It slipped off
152 the ends of the heavy planks, shuddered, and continued to roll. "C'MON baby, c'mon, they urged, and finally the Dakota
153 was skimmimg along the field and was airborne, climbing and turning right to 165 degrees.
154 Delta keyed the PA and announced;"Well be over the target in sixteen minutes. Get ready".
155 The others worked swiftly, wrestling heavy drums of gasoline toward the now closed door. A stack of small wooden 
156 crates sat beside the drums.
157 "Target it sight. Get ready..." the PA barked. The door was pulled open, Lou and George poised... "NOW!". The five 
158 drums were thrown out, and crashed into the south end of the large white Stucco complex. They burst on impact, soaking
159 the walls with high octane aviation fuel. Delta whipped the DC-3 into a tight turn, and skimmed over the trees from
160 the north. "NOW!" The las three barrels were rolled out, smashing into the north end. "Bullseye!" cried the pilot, as
161 he again manhandled the big Dakota into it's final chandelle. Climbing, then easing back the yoke and dumping flaps
162 to slow the craft... "NOW!" And the stack of wooden boxes fell earthward as the pilot firewalled the throttles.
163 There was an enormous 'whump' that hurled the DC-3 a hundred feet into the air. Below-the entire complex was in flames.
164 There were explosions everywhere, and gigantic clouds of black smoke filled the sky. 
165    The red and white DC-3 climbed swiftly, heading out over the Caribbean Sea. George came up with the few last cans
166 of Budweiser, and the three man crew gulped long swallows, washing the dust from three dry throats. Everyone was 
167 strangely calm, exhillerated, exhausted...For several minutes no one spoke. Then George looked up, sniffing the air.
168 "What the..OH MY GOD, his eyes riveted on something in the hold... One small wooden box had been overlooked. Grey 
169 smoke seeped from the corners. Lou saw it and the two men dived into to hold, trying frantically to get it out the 
170 hold door...
171 
172 
173 
174 AGENTS PARITY AND FELLOWS STOOD SILENTLY BEFORE THE PRESIDENT. "RECONNAISSANCE FOUND NOTHING. NO TRACE...
175 "NO PARACHUTES?"
176 THE PRESIDENT LOOKED AWAY FROM THE TWO MEN;"I'M SORRY..."
177 HE CONTINUED;"WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE FREE WORLD MAY WELL HAVE SAVED THAT WORLD. THIS OFFICE, THIS COUNTRY OWES 
178 YOU ETERNAL GRATITUDE...I ONLY WISH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE COULD KNOW OF YOUR HEROISM..."
179  
180 Parity and Fellows walked through the wide ornamental iron gates of the White House, and onto the boulevard. 
181 Birds were singing; the Cherry trees blosomming. Fellows spoke;"Well, let's go find Ian...

190 Whoa!!! That above is what I call an entry and a half! A failsafe plot: kinda like Chuck Norris Mmeets Rambo, only
191 with a better storyline. But PLEASE try to remember that Soviet people are not intrinsicly evil.. They are people, like
192 everyone else. I get tired of every Soviet person portrayed in the media as being fat, bombastic or stupid, sadistic,
193 dense, blind followers. They are humans.Oh well. Off mysoapbox for a while. Never can seem to just LURK can I?

208 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
209     "Parity?" Fellows tendered the name in question form. Both men, despite
210 their years of training and conditioning, where just one notch above shock
211 after all that had happened in the last 36 hours.
212     "Yes Fellows?"  The plane trip to Puerto Rico, the depositing of the
213 defecting Russians, the delivery of the prize, the congratulations from the
214 local NET representative, the radio message: George, Lou, and Delta V: contact
215 lost, NET search parties turning up nothing, the red-eye to Washington, a talk
216 with the President, and now, the realization of ramifications of the actions
217 during the past day-and-a-half.
218     "I was just wondering... thinking about everyone, especially Delta. I
219 liked him, rogue that he was. He thinks, er, thought like we do. Action is the
220 name of the game. The shakers and movers live at the crest Parity. We live
221 at the crest."
222      "And sometimes the crest bucks Fellows, like this mission. Four good
223 men lost. Great men, gone, in the service of something greater. It may be
224 a crest Fellows, but it has the qualities ofn abyss too. I don't care
225 what the NET books say, I am hurting right now. We nabbed the laser. We
226 torched McKane's HQ and he was 85 percent likely to be inside. And we lost
227 Delta and the others. Who won?"
228     "Parity, you know I hate statistics. As for who won, I can't say. I
229 know we lost a lot, but the other side lost something too. They suffered."
230     The talk had led them to a corner. Instead of answering, Parity hailed
231 a cab. As the big yellow cut two lanes to reach them, Parity turned to
232 Fellows and said, "We are going to HQ. We've got to figure out what has
233 happened to Ian."
234      "Where to boys?" the burly taxi hearder asked.
235      "To the airport James. And there's an extra sawbuck if you can make
236 it in 15 minutes." Fellows countered.
237      "No problem, but my name's not James, it's Eric."
238      "Eric?" Fellows and Parity exchanged a glance.
239      "We suffered too Fellows."

263 Here's my beef here's my beef
264         Most writers on this board wouldn't make a story unless they're throwing
265 tirades to the Russians, Nicaraguans and Libyans.  I say Whooa, too.  The 
266 Russians and Nicaraguans are yet to sink a U.S. destroyer or a battleship.
267        What I'm driving is at is that there are countries who has dstroyed
268 U.S. naval  vessels and yet adored by lot of people here in the US.
269       Israel for example, and the Japanese empire.  Yet, no one dare to
270 call them terrorists.

363 1986.  Another year.  A growing uneasiness.  The feeling has been coming on for several years now.  Mostly since
364 1980.  It was only last year that I finally figured it out.  I realized that I was only a mortal, wi
365 weaknessess, vulnerable to many things hidden and unseen.  It's hard to realize that you aren't a god anymore.
366 Another year without a job.  These part time fill in jobs are the pits.  At least the last job lasted 7 years, 
367 giving a false sense of permanency.  Unfortunately, the company moved out of Oregon, following many other
368 companies on a mass exodus to greender pastrues.  The other jobs were never permnent, but at least they usu
369 lasted 1-2 years.  Now, if a job lasts 1-2 weeks, I feel lucky.  If I were the
370 quiting type, I guess I would have checked out of here and moved to parts unknown long ago.  Seems like nothing
371 makes much sense anymore.  But the thought of quitting makes me ill.  Before I do something like that, I plan
372 to be on top again.  I don't want people to be able to say that I couldn't handle it.
373      1969.  A fresh idealistic teenager emerges for the coocon of high school and makes a choice.  He may
374 understand the reasons for a 'police-action,' but he knowns that his duty is clear.  Down to the enlis
375 office.  The recruiter says don't worry, only the draftees go to Nam.  December 1969, "I'm Leaving on a Jet Plane"
376 makes it to the top of the charts.  How appropriate.  January 1970 am in a foreign country, at war with i
377 Due to a striving for excellance in everything I do, have had training in 4 different schools.  Cooking fo
378 rating, S.E.R.E. school, S.E.A.L training, and a political indoctrination school tht has no name and isn't ever 
379 mentioned in records anywhere.  I excell in all of these things, as I believe.  I believe that God is on the side
380 of righteouness, that I am fighting for my country.  The Domino theory is sound,and the Communist threat must be
381 met head on and defeated.
382      It is is 1970 that I find out that I am a god.  We are all gods.  We have te power to create, to save,
383 to destroy.  The earth teaches us the 'human' virtues.  The long night, deep in no mans land, alternately hunted
384 and pursued after a successfull mission teaches fear.  The days of waiting, waiting for the one shot to complete
385 the assignment all the while watching the jungle creatures and insects going about their destinies, ignoring the
386 god in their midst, teaches humility.  The wounded and the damned (natives) teaches pity and compassion.  It
387 hard not to have feelings after looking at napalm victims, or the left-overs after a VC recru
388 a small village during the night.  After watching a two-stepper finally crawl away from your warm leg afte
389 hours of waiting teaches relief.  The sound of blood gurgling out of a friends sucking chest wound teach
390 hope, and hate.  This must be a cheap lesson, as it is taught over and over again.  My one trip into Saig
391 teaches shame.  The amount of thieves, black marketers, drug pushers, pimps and hookers amazes me.  The migh
392 US Military can sure make changes where ever it goes.
393      I am the best.  I have more successful missions than anyone in IV Corp AO.  I become the Spade Ace, 
394 minor legend.  A full division hunted me for a month, but couldn't catch me.  I left them with no officers when
395 I finally made it back to my unit.
396      I have taught medicine and sanitation to villages, prevented wholesale deaths from plague, diptheria, and
397 cholera.  I have saved more children from death and starvation then could go to a grade school.
398      Worry was one object lesson I won't forget.  March 18th, I was hooking up wth a platoon for extraction
399 made it, but the platoon is ambushed and nearly wiped out 20 minutes later.  Two weeks as a POW, I make my
400 escape.  An unexpected Arc Light mission nearly kills us all, but five of us make for the hills.  We le
401 and 10 VC dead.  Sick, weakened, and bleeding from the ears and nose, we make our way back, followed by the
402 (Opps)--for the hills.  We leave 4 US and 10 VC dead.  Sick, weakened, and bleeding from the ears and nose, we 
403 make our way back, followed by the 15 VC survivors.  The worst thing (for me) is that we are all quite d
404 For the army boys, the worst thing is our situation.  No food, no radio, no medicine, no friendles in our ar
405 I wish the US Army would give better training to its own.  These guys are completely defeated.  After 4 weeks
406 we make it back.  Only lost one boy, to dysentery.
407      I get a vacation, 3 days rest and real food, and then out again as a village advisor.  But I guess t
408 enough for now.  If I get drunk enough again, and feel like this, maybe I will
409 continue, maybe not.  Sorry to whine in public.

448 Farley was struggling to forget that his other mission was postponed.  He was
449 also trying to drive at the same time.  It was difficult for him, just  then,
450 to do both at the same time.  James might have noticed, but didn't say a word.
451 Streets flew by, turns taken, signals obeyed, all while Farley sat in
452 something like a trance.  At last, they arrived at a downtown parking structure
453 somewhere near Ione Plaza.  On the lowest level underground, a portion of
454 a wall pivoted to provide a one-lane tunnel under the city.
455 Later, both agents were in the regional headquarters of NET.  Farley went to
456 his desk and tapped a sequence on the COMSET mounted there.
457 <Agent E.F. Farley: Report to Conference Room 10B at 1700.  A. Lovelace has
458 your instructions.>
459 James asked, "May I?" and tapped his own sequence.
460 <Agent J. Garret: Report to Conference Room 10B at 1700.  A. Lovelace has
461 your instructions.>
462 "Hey, looks like we're gonna work together this time 'round, Eugene.  I
463 Wonder who else'll show?"
464 Farley glanced at his watch.  4:46pm.  "We'll find out.  'Further up,
465 Further in!'" he said as he moved toward the lift.

541 Hi All,     Tuck here.  It looks like things are too quiet here.  Let's
542 stir things up.  (Call me a twit if you want to, but all I want is some
543 interplay of ideas.)  What do you think about PRAYER IN SCHOOLS.?
544 1) Is in morally correct to brainwash young minds with this religious prattle?
545 2) Can America survive this governmental support of immorality?
546 3) Will the greatest nation on Earth rot because the government has taken
547    away the moral support that prayer can offer?  In the one place where
548    children are ready to learn.
549 4) Can the Supreme Court continue in their stuggle to uphold the rights of
550    the people, even with several possible new appointments?
551 	Anybody willing to take the challenge?  Have I offended you?
552 Well, your only chance to fight back is right here.  Let's here what you
553 have to say.  I want your opinion.

556 To the Fried Turkey above: Perhaps if you were willing to assert something
557 in particular with the intention of eliciting comments, you might have more
558 success. But when you attempt to antagonize people with a collage of contra
559 dicting generalizations that obviate your lack of committment, you only attempt
560 to initiate eternal ambiguity amongst modemers who have long ago learned to
561 ignore neophytes who have no convictions. Grow up, sonny, and when you have
562 something to say, perhaps Daddy will let you borrow the keys to the modem again.

564 The day had been hazy and THOR had felt sluggish throughout his trip.
565 Finally finding a place to rest, he walked into the Inn called Backwater.
566 Here he found tale makers and sooth sayers galore but also THOR was troubled
567 for he found many who spoke in tongues unfamiliar to him. THOR had been most
568 everywhere on this blue planet but he had never seen the likes of what he saw
569 at the BACKWATER. What was wrong with these travelers that they did not want
570 to share their tales? Why must they cover their words with codes and gibberish
571 when all that THOR could see were as himself, travelers wishing to speak with
572 the others.Setting his great frame down into a chair, THOR put down his bag
573 and the great hammer. I will watch and  see what will be, he thought to him
574 self. THOR looked about the INN for a   friendly or familiar face.

580 Slurs on the juvies?  Oboy, this is going to end up in a mud slinging match
581 isn't it?  There is now way, however, that I am not going to get my licks in
582 about prayer in schools.  If there is a little Jesus freak in school, there
583 are so many times a day he could enact his rites that there is no need for a
584 mandated prayer.
585 The only reason I can see for this official event is to bring the United States
586 in line as a Religious State.  Something candidate for senate Joe Lutz and the
587 (Im)Moral Major(Minor)ity are all in favor of.  What do you think, should we
588 live in an echo of the Spanish Inquisition, with Christian cops beating up the
589 aagnostics, and the Jews, or should we have a nation free of jihad stained
590 politics?

598 Ah... I remember the days when Pam would clean the tables up back here. Now she's not even seen in the Inn these days. 
599 I wonder what has happened to her, why has she given up on BW? though I guess I can understand what with all the twit activity
600 in the past year, I'm amazed that as many of the good partrons have stuck around that have. Yet even so time has taken its
601 toll. Even the venerable Piper seems to be in permenant lurk mode these days. Perhaps it is no longer possible to have an
602 open and free forum of this type. BBSing seems to have become discovered by the great unwashed masses, and as a result has
603 deteriorated to the level of bickering, slander, abuse of the english language, vandlism, vengful spite, and just plain twitish
604 behavor in general. Not that it was free from such activities in the past, but it seems like that has become the only activity
605 that has grown in the last year, while the marvalous stories, debates, and generl communications have deminished. 
606 Perhaps it is that BBSing has lost its glamor to those who are in the vangaurd of such things and they have moved on to other 
607 activities. But where are they? Where have they gone...what activities holds their intrest now? The Innkeeper is here, I saw him
608 coming out of the wine celler the other day. The piper has been noding in front of the great fireplace for some time. Some of
609 the more adventurous types have swaped tales with each other at the main tables. Yet the tellers of great fantasy have long been
610 absent from the system. Will they ever return? Has that part of the life of BW come to an end? Has it come to this, to be 
611 discarded, given to the children to play with and be crumped and tossed aside as nothing? Is this the end of BW?
