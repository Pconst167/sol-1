30 Leonard and ZEBbie adventurers: Please excuse a minor typing error that
31     results in a major logic error.  In my last story entrance, I wrote
32     a group of assertions and a conclusion.  Unfortunately, I mistyped
33     that conclusion.  If you look at the repeat written to Leonard, the
34     conclusion is correct.  It should read  W => !P.  P must be negated
35     for the conclusion to be true.  (Someday I'll have download abilities
36     and be able to check my typing before I post it...)

39      Those of you with long memories may remember that we left dear Doctor
40 Frankenstupe in the hands of an obscure Mid-East terrorist group.  Never
41 fear, Frankenstupe fans (all two of you), the Doctor has been rescued and
42 now sits in his room at the Sunnyvale Rest Home with his good friend and
43 mentor, Sigmund...
44  
45      "Doctor, what is all this?"  Sigmund asked.  He waved his hand at a 
46 twisted contraption of wires, tubes, and flashing lights.  "It looks like
47 something from a Rube Goldberg nightmare."
48      "Impressive, isn't it?"  the Doctor said.  "It's my latest invention."
49 He puffed his chest out proudly.
50      "Er... it certainly looks complicated.  What does it do?"
51      "Well, it seems that many of the Innhabitants are currently examining
52 their own psyches.  Perhaps I should follow the trend.  This machine will
53 allow me to journey within my own subconscious."
54      "Are you sure it's safe?"  Sigmund asked.
55      "Why of course."  The Doctor held out an electrode-studded headband.
56 "Would you like to try it?"
57      "No, no... and I wonder if you should either.  Doctor, you've been in
58 the midst of a personal crisis recently.  I'm not sure a side trip into 
59 your subconscious would be wise at the moment."
60      "Phooey!  Sigmund, you worry too much.  This is just the thing I need
61 right now."  Frankenstupe slipped the metal band onto his head.  "Hmmm...
62 now do I turn on switch A first, or was that switch B?  No matter,"  the
63 Doctor continued to mumble under his breath as he twisted dials and flipped
64 toggle switches.
65      "Doctor, wait..."  Sigmund said.
66      "I can't now, as my Daddy used to say:  'No guts, no glory'."  The
67 machine began to hum ominously.  Fly wheels turned.  Grey smoke drifted to
68 the ceiling.  "Oh, Sigmund, one thing..."
69      "Yes?"
70      "If that red light goes on..."  The Doctor pointed to a large red 
71 light on top of the contraption.  "It means there is a minor problem with
72 the system.  Nothing to worry about actually, but it's vital that you..."
73 The air shimmered and Doctor Frankenstupe was gone.
74      "I must what?"  Sigmund called out.  The red light began to blink
75 furiously.  There was no reply.

101 not even take a week before they are gone totally, drive B and everything!
102 But now that school is going to start very soon I would expect the entries to
103 slow down a little bit.  Just this morning this disk was started and so far

108 	"Hmmm, if I add just a bit more over here and a little more over...
109 No No No not what I wanted at all."  Dissatisfied with the drawing I wiped
110 my sandy slate smooth, clearing the path for a new feeling or thought.
111 	Grasping my twig like an artist would hold his brush, the beginning
112 of a idea came forth.  After some carefull thought the image finally began.
113 Three long broad vertical lines crossed at the top and sharply pointed at
114 the bottom were the first to appear.  A line down the center below the cross
115 and ending at the point gave each of the swords the distingtion it needed.
116 Beneath the blades a suit if armor laying prone began to take shape.  
117 	Nearing the end of my illustrated thought, I sensed someone approaching
118 .  Laying down the twig, I raised my head to see who it may be.  Making eye
119 contact, I motioned to him to join me.  Quietly he approached and lightly
120 settled down into a comfortable position on the ground.  His eyes left mine
121 looking down at the many lines in the sand then back up again as if to ask
122 what meaning lye within them.  With a reasurring glance, I again picked up
123 my twig and finised the image hoping thOto give him a better understanding.
124 Upon finishing the sleeping armor the thought was finnished off with
125 another sword, horizontal this time, was drawn under the still figure.

134        I    In the long, sleepless watches of the night,
135             a gentle face -the face of one long dead-
136          looks at me from the wall, where round its head
137            the night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
138           Here in this room she died; and soul more white
139             never through martyrdom of fire was led
140              to its repose; nor can in books be read
141                the legend of a life more benedight.
142             There is a mountain in the distant west
143              that, sun-defying, in its deep ravines
144              displays a cross of snow upon its side.
145             Such is the cross I wear upon my breast
146          these eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
147            and seasons, changeless since the day she died.

234 Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be
235 in silence.  As far a possible without surrender be  on good terms with all
236 persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even
237 the dull and ignorant; they to have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive
238 persons, they are vexations to the spirit.  If you compare yourself with
239 others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and
240 lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
241 Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession
242 in the changing fortunes of time.  Exercise caution in your business affairs;
243 for the world is full of trickery.  But let this not blind you to what virtue
244 there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full
245 of heroism.  Be yourself.  Especially, do not feign affection.  Neither be
246 cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is
247 perennial as the grass.  Take kindly the council of the years, gracefully 
248 surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of sporot to shield you 
249 in sudden misfortune.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many
250 fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.  Beyond a wholesome discipline, be
251 gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees
252 and the stars; you have the right to be here.  And whether you conceive Him to be
253 and whatever your labors and asporations, in the noisy confusion of life keep 
254 peace with you soul.  With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is
255 still a beautiful world.  Be careful.  Strive to be happy.

278 Tin Man: Don't hold down the backspace key... in fact, don't even type them
279 too fast. BW 'echoes' backspace as 'backspace space backspace' (because not
280 all terminals erase upon backspacing). If you send them too fast, the space
281 can get 'lost' leaving your cursor farther back than it 'really' is.

333 000001TED - Were it not for your return, I might have just been so very tempted
334   to have said something along those very same lines.  I, on the other hand, do
335   not see defense as a parasite.  I admit it, I'm brainwashed (@%_#@**! I HATE
336   that word!) as well as my fair, departed damsel of yesterday.
337        It would seem that there are plenty of us here, that I know of, that can
338 say we have lost our precious ones to another way of thinking.  Yet however
339 slowly the days go by I know, and she knows that I will be waiting for our
340 reunion.  However lonely the waiting may be, I won't turn my back on intuition.
341 There's one chance to save her, and I know she'll return the favor.  I know
342 that what helps her make it through is the knowledge that I will be here.  And
343 she is all I live for, or so it seems.  So here I wait, (almost) silently.
344 L'homme - Did I ever tell you that I found that book you told me to get?  It's
345   been so long, I just wanted to make sure you knew that I remember Franz K.
346   I've had the book for a long time now, and haven't gotten around to reading
347   quite yet.  Maybe I'll start to read it as soon as Tin Man gets his XT...
348 so -  Well, you wanted it.  Now you've got it.  But if I'm to do anything
349   relavent I'll have to get some more material from L'homme before I should
350   continue...  There's so much more to be done and I can't remember where I
351   left off.  I've lost the direction and the inspiration for it...
352 Guru(s) - There is more importance to drivle than you may perceive.  But to
353   save paper is above all the most important thing of all, isn't it?
354 Might the apprentice be around here somewhere?  I thought I saw his markings
355   near here not all that long ago.  Hmm, perhaps I was mistaken.
356 Max - Pray tell, just how did you enter those remarkable lines?

358 Dear Doctor - I do believe you have forgotten how to count!  Either that or
359   you must have been interupted... yes, that sounds about right.
360   Oh, you're gone.

363 (trying again -- let's see if it'll stay in ENTER mode today)
364   The young lady who had called herself ZEB moved slightly under the piper's
365 touch.  Her thin shoulders seemed rather frail to support the load that seemed
366 to be loading them.  The slight quiver spoke directly to the piper's heart,
367 warmed by (perhaps an excess of) compassion, and he pulled her into a gentle
368 embrace for a long moment.  He spoke softly.
369   "Let me help.  I need information."
370   For a long moment she relaxed against him.  "You can think of this as a
371 meta-reality," she said.  "It is an area that partakes of aspects of two,
372 nearly opposite realities, and makes the interface between the two nearly
373 comprehensible.  One is nearly an inverse of the other."
374   "In what way?" asked the piper.
375   "In nearly every way.  The dark, hard surface beneath us represents your
376 home reality band.  The darkness and solidity represent lack of life.  The
377 points of light that are visible throughout this lightless solid represent
378 the bits of vital force that differentiate living things from the non-living."
379   She turned and stepped out of his embrace.  With a sweep of her hand she
380 indicated the sofly glowing space above and around them.  
381   "Above us are the realities that I used to inhabit.  Space itself is alive,
382 but look closely."
383   The piper followed the path of her pointing finger.  Suspended in the "air"
384 before her was a tiny black speck.  Once aware of the darkness suspended in
385 the light, the piper looked closely, and saw the inverse of the light patterns
386 picked out in darkness in the glowing space about them.
387   "But how...?" the piper asked.
388   "We are beyond our original realities here," she answered.  "This is the 
389 junction -- the shear plane that separates the two types of reality.  Just
390 as the yin-yang symbol contains seeds of the other within each of the opposites
391 that comprise the whole, these two types of reality contain portions of the
392 other making up the meta-reality where we now stand."
393   The piper stood for a moment lost in thought.
394   "Even the fundamental laws of our realities are nearly in opposition," she
395 continued.  "The arrows of time and entropy point in opposite directions."
396   "But," the piper interrupted, "that means..."
397   "Yes," she continued.  "While for you the natural tendency is for things to
398 move from a state of order to disorder, for us the universe tends to impose
399 order where none existed before.  You proceed from birth to death while we
400 come into existence at death and proceed inexorably toward birth.  You seek
401 education to gain knowledge, while we attend school to remove it.  For you,
402 the span of your life from birth to NOW remains in your mind as the past.  You
403 have no knowlege of what is to come before your death.  We remember the
404 other way -- I know of my life between NOW and my death, but the past is closed
405 to me."

458 L'homme - Now that your working your little fingers to the bone on getting
459   things to look picture perfect, I just comment that truth may indeed be
460   clever, the truth also hurts.  Can you say the Five Words without wincing?
461   I didn't think so.  Oh, and do you happen to remember that piece of synchro-

474  22 & 24 block that you are missing.  More interestingly, I do Not have
475  that mysterious 22 July 84 that you found, but I DO have 17 Aug 84, which you
476  don't.  Since THE LIST only goes up to July 84, I don't know how accurate our
477  lists are after then.  All the missing files exist in my Model 1 set, though.
478  (Unless we get them from Mikey again, I'll have to copy them over to single
479  sided for your LNW, then give them to you to use your xfer program on to get
480  them to MS-DOS so I can get them back... sigh.  I thought we were done with
481  this nonsense?)
482 Mikey: as you can see, our archives are slightly out of sync.  Do you suppose
483  you could supply us with a master list of archive file dates, so we can get

501 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
502   The piper looked for a long time at the slight figure facing him.
503 "I begin to understand," he said gently.  "Perhaps not fully, but somewhat."
504   Looking at the tears still coursing down her face, he asked, "Tell me this.
505 If your set of realities is a mirror image of mine, would not all I find as
506 good you find as evil, and so forth?  What brings me sorrow should bring you
507 joy, and I should delight in things that would trouble you."
508   A slight and brief smile passed over her face.
509   "I did NOT say that our realities were mirror images of each other," she
510 said firmly.  "The only mirroring is in the very rough physical sense."
511 She turned and stepped, bringing a wash of light from the black pavement 
512 beneath her feet.
513   "That light," began the piper.
514   Her face fell.  "Come here and look closely."
515   She knelt down on the black pavement, the piper came and knelt beside her,
516 each of his movements bringing a wash of light from the pavement.
517   "Watch closely now,"  her fingertip traced the black pavement slowly,
518 leaving a faint luminous trail until it reached one of the glowing points
519 that filled the transparent blackness of the pavement.  A flare of light
520 filled the piper's eyes and for a long moment he was elsewhere.
521 
522   He was clinging to a cliff face, filled with the awful knowledge that
523 this time he had tempted fate once too often.  He had always been strong
524 and skillful, and this knowlege had made him careless.  He was alone now,
525 his companions had fallen long ago.  His skill and strength had served
526 only to prolong the inevetable.  The cliff shuddered, a reminder of the
527 quake that had torn his companions from their holds and shaken them from
528 the rock face like fleas from a mangy dog.  Another quiver, the hot
529 mineral smell of fractured rock, and the cliff face to which he was 
530 clinging collapsed.  Long, unbelieving moments of falling, a painful grazing
531 impact, with the sick inner knowlege of serious damage to the body,
532 then a brief moment of total pain.
533 
534   The piper sat up, apalled.
535   "You see," the tears rolled down her cheeks, "We live here only through
536 the death of others."  She straightened up, erect but on her knees facing
537 the piper.  "How can I justify my own existence with this as a result?"
538   The piper reached for her, and she came into his embrace like an injured
539 child seeking comfort.
540   "How can I go on?"  Her thin body was shaking in his embrace.  "How can
541 I endure this?  How can I change what is happening?"
542   The piper moved slightly, bringing a wash of light from the pavement.
543 He sat back, weeping figure in his arms, seeing with newly sensitized eyes
544 some of the causes of the light.  He sat on an immense battlefield, watching
545 giant machines reap men's lives like stalks of ripe wheat.  With the 
546 sobbing body of ZEB in his arms, he stalked the avenues of death watching 
547 the humble to the heroic, feeling the pang of loss even as the loss of
548 life gave him strength on the meta-plane of reality he inhabited.

554    The power of the circle incomplete redefines attraction and dominion. The
555 compelling force for completion can compete with most other forces in this
556 universe. Unfortunately, a power from outside the universe acted as impediment
557 towards the forces of completion. ZEB grew, ZEB counteracted, ZEB withdrew,
558 as the power of the group grew, and then, withdrew.
559    Cragmore broke concentration. "I... am sorry. We can't do it. My vision,
560 our vision was blocked by something from within the void. Piper is no longer
561 where he was. He has moved from our space to another space. Our circle is
562 not complete, and our friend is lost."
563    Trainor moved from the control panel to the room where the others were now
564 just coming out of various trances. "What do you mean lost? He is out there,
565 isn't he? Even in this place people don't just disappear."
566    Cragmore's brow darkened, and getting up, he motioned Trainor back into the
567 other room. "Listen, I wasn't sure I should say anything in front of the
568 others now, but I think Piper did not want to come back. Remember the impressions
569 I felt when I tried to contact him before? They were much stronger this time.
570 Our circle should have overcome anything...anything except the will of the
571 object we wish to complete the circle with. Piper is a very strong-willed
572 person, and that coupled with the singular aspects of this void made union
573 impossible. He is lost my friend, lost from this reality and all other
574 realities we are familiar with."
575    "What do you suggest?" Trainor was visibly upset over the whole ordeal.
576    "I suggest we tell the others, and then combine our kwledge. Perhaps then
577 a plan, or even a direction, will make itself clear. We must get piper back,
578 but we must also destroy this thing that has destroyed your home and will most
579 certainly wreck havoc in all the realities."
580  
581    Trainor and Cragmore repeated all that had gone on between them for the
582 others. A grim silence shrouded the entire Pell-mell, which was now set to
583 drift in the path of the creature from ZEB, following the leading point of
584 the ZEB by several R-distances.
585    "I have known piper so long." Bard said with a heavy heart. "I can't believe
586 he is gone."
587    The others followed with similar sentiments, but Trainor would have none of
588 it.
589    "Do not equate his absence with death! Never make the mistake of giving up!
590 Piper is not with us, but since when does that mean death? Remember who we are
591 speaking of. Piper can take care of himself. The fact that we found no trace
592 of him means he is not in this reality universe anymore, but it certainly
593 doesn't mean he has met his final fate, and left his physical body forever. On
594 my planet, we fight death constantly. We love life to such a degree that death
595 is totally repulsive, and we resist it until there is nothing left. We never
596 never give up, and neither should you. ZEB has destroyed that life-loving
597 people already, we must never forget that.
598    "you are right, of course" said lady tayree. "we must not give up. we must
599 find piper and destroy this ZEB before is does any more harm."
600    "Yes, that's the spirit. We have the sentiment, now we must have the plan!"
601 Trainor hoped that with the combined knowledge and skill of the people he had
602 assembled, tayree's and his words would not be empty ones.
