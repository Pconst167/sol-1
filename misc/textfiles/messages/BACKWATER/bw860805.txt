24 AH, SO CLOSE, YET SO FAR....
25  TO ALL WHO PREACH ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF THE GOOD OLE DAYS, HERES MY PERSONAL
26 PERSPECTIVE:
27  I HAVE HAD A MODEM FOR 3 YEARS. MY FIRST MODEM WAS A C-64 MODEM, AND NOW I
28 AM USING AN ATARI SYSTEM. I HAVE PROB
29 BEEN MODEMING FOR A BIT LONGER THAN SOME OF YOU, BUT WHO REALLY CARES. MY 
30 MEMORIES OF YOUR GOOD OLE DAYS ARE NOT SO NOSTALGIC. IT SEEMS THAT ALL THAT 
31 YOU ARE SEEKING IN A SYSTEM, SUCH AS BACKWATER, IS TO KEEP A RELATIVELY
32 SMALL GROUP OF FRIENDS TOGETHER. INSTEAD OF WELCOMING NEW USERS, YOU PROD 
33 THEM BY CALLING THEM NAMES, SUCH AS "TWIT". BIG DEAL, HOLY MEN. ITS NOT GONNA
34 MATTER TO ME MUCH IF BWMS GOES DOWN. OR ANY GIVEN BOARD. BW HAS CONSTANTLY
35 SHOWN ME LITTLE REASON TO STAY AND CONTINUE TO LOG IN EACH AND EVERY (OR EVERY
36 OTHER) DAY. THINGS HAVE BEEN SLOW LATELY. OK, THIS IS LIFE. BUT PLEASE DONT
37 PRETEND LIKE THE PAST WAS SO GREAT. IT WAS RELATIVELY THE SAME AS TODAY. 
38  THINK: CHILDREN LIVE IN "TODAY", THE PRESENT
39         ADULTS LIVE IN THE FUTURE
40         THE OLD LIVE IN THE PAST...
41  IM TRYING TO SAY, THE PRESENT IS ALL THAT MATTERS! IF YOU BLOW IT NOW, THERE
42 WILL BE NO BW TOMORROW.....

48       There  is  chaos and there is nothing.  There is no  light, 
49 there   is   not  even  the  concept   of   light.   Reality   is 
50 disintegrating.  The  very  fabric of existance collapsing in  on 
51 itself. Life itself grown in complexity, one with the cosmic all, 
52 infinate knowledge and nothing.  No knowledge of self, no self to 
53 have  knowledge  of,   only  the  feeling  of  fullfilment,   all 
54 encompassing, completeness, peace and serenity. Feelings of loss, 
55 death, decay, a forever perception disinegrating, disapating into 
56 nothing, the end of everything... and the beginning.

63    The Nevada landscape spread out like a giant hand laid flat upon some
64 plain. Hills like knuckles rose in the distance, and a speeding car threw up
65 a small cloud of dust along the palm. The car flew straight across the
66 desert. The thin line of blacktop it followed the only thing that appeared
67 man-made on the sun-drenched tableau.
68    From the car's viewpoint, the knuckle-hills were the only relief to the
69 otherwise flatness this part of Nevada offered. Miles and miles of empty
70 spaces.
71    But looks can be deceiving, and Parity knew this to be true. They were
72 only two hours out of Vegas, heading for a place he had not seen in many years.
73 But the destination held fond memories of friendship and security, and that
74 was enough to push Parity's foot further down on the accelerator. 
75    Fellows had seen better days. Even with the compound bandage Parity had
76 fixed outside of town after the escape from the hotel parking lot, blood
77 seeped through, staining the car's cloth seatcover. Parity realized that any
78 place equipped to give medical help was also equipped to call the police. From
79 the car's radio Parity knew that the Westward Ho explosion was the talk of

80 the town, and the number-one unsolved crime on the law enforcement books.
81    He had one alternative. Four years back on another mission in the area,
82 an injured Parity had stumbled onto a farm house out in the middle of that not-
83 so-popular place called nowhere. Barely able to stand, Parity had crawled to
84 the door, and collapsed against it. The next thing he remembered was lying
85 in bed, discovering his wounds expertly dressed, and hearing soft country music
86 playing in the background. The occupants of the house turned out to be a
87 retired doctor and his wife, who after years of living in the city had 
88 decided, with more than a little trepidation, to live in the country. Their
89 approximate three-hour normal drive to Vegas was the one compromise they made
90 to getting back to their roots.
91    Doctor Buchan, and his wife, Ionna, took care of Parity for one week, until
92 he had enough strength to stand the ride back to the airport in the doctor's
93 old Cadillac. Parity never forgot them, and they had said to be sure and 
94 drop in again sometime. Agent Parity was about to take them up on their offer.
95    The scenery of Parity's drive with Fellows unconscious in the passenger
96 seat blended into that of Buchan's drive with Parity four years ago. Parity
97 remembered what he and the doctor had said during the trip.
98    "Son, I won't ask you what you do for a living or what you were doing in
99 the desert on foot half-dead. But I've seen wounds like the one's you have,
100 and I know how people get them. You aren't a Fuller-brush salesman on a long-
101 distance call." The doctor thought humor was one of the best medicines, and
102 rightly so.
103    "Then you probably also know I can't really tell you what I do, even if
104 you did ask. I appreciate your not asking too many questions. I realize it
105 is not every day a bleeding stranger comes up to your door."
106    "No, Ionna and I don't get many visitors. Our monthly trip to stockpile
107 the cupboard is just about the exposure we get to people anymore. I'm too
108 old to live completely off the land, besides this land isn't worth a hoot-
109 in-Hell for growing anyway." As Buchan said this, his friendly eyes turned
110 to Parity and he smiled. "We came out here to get away. I think you did too."
111 
112    The road changed consistency, from blacktop to older cracking pavement.
113 Parity remembered when the road had changed the other way before, and knew
114 he was only a few more minutes to the house. He looked at Fellows, whose
115 head lay back between the head rest of the seat and the window. A slight
116 rise and fall of Fellows' chest told Parity his friend was still alive. But
117 the rise and fall was not regular, and Parity knew he didn't have much time.
118    As the car drew closer to the doctor's old homestead, a multitude of
119 worries flashed through Parity's mind. What if they were gone? What if they
120 had given up their place and moved back to the city. What if the doctor isn't
121 up to taking care of Fellows? There were so many questions that Parity had
122 not had the time to ask. He started to worry. His hands clenched the steering
123 wheel even tighter. 'Almost there.' he said to himself.

200 sufficient " Lambs ". I told him I would pass the word...and because of 
201 such short notice...I was unsure that we would have a quorum....

229 I think 'The Defender Thing' was right about the drivel posted about
230 me by 'The Swamp Thing' (what an appropriate monker!)--he does seem only
231 to be interested in starting a fight.  In any case, I truly do not care
232 what Swamp Thing cares concerning whether Bit Bucket was slow, outdated,
233 or whatever.  That is "it's" privilege.  However, the reference that I
234 am a "S.O.B." is something that sticks with me, and this, I resent.
235 It's types such as this that really make me glad that I took the system
236 down when it did.  I wouldn't want the stench of such beasts to cause
237 .
238 .END
239 Hey, don't worry.  Anyone who pays money out of pocket four years to provide

249 impression you are playing on words again.

300      Something cold hit my forhead. And again. Coughing, I opened my eyes. 
301 I was met witha veiw of green walls and a white ceiling. I felt tired and 
302 weak. I wanted to go back to sleep, but the constant dripping on my 
303 forhead wouldn't allow it. I tried to get up. At first my body wouldn't 
304 respond, then I realized that my arms were tied. With that came the memory 
305 of how I got here. 
306      A robot, an android had drugged me and now I was laying in my own 
307 bath tub tied up. The dripping water had been a help though, it lossened 
308 the cloth bindings about my arms. With a little difficulty I was able to 
309 break free. 
310      Grasping the shower door for support, I climbed out of the tub. I 
311 felt very week, but I had to get out of there. Stumbling towards the door, 
312 I held on to it. My vistor appeared to be gone. The front door was open, 
313 letting the warm outside air inside. I moved to go close the door. 
314      Halfway there I slipped and fell. Oil... fine machine oil. It 
315 appeared the android had a leak in it's lubrication system.  Picking 
316 myself up I closed the door. 
317      My computer! Avoiding the oil slick, I headed back to the living 
318 room. The CD drive was gone, as was the computer. A rather large amount of 
319 oil stained the rug where I kept the computer. On impulse, I went to the 
320 closet where I kept sveral cans of motor oil... sure enough, they were 
321 gone. 
322      Going back into the living room, I looked at the desk where I had 
323 kept my computer. A glint of metal on the floor caught my eye. A cuff- 
324 link? It was in the shape of a cog, and had the inscription IM5.

327 of a fair computer pales by comparison.  Who knows? This is the 80's.
328 We have ERA, gay-rights and I guess you can rescue a computer if you want to.
329 But *what* would you do with it once you had it?  Call Backwater?

386 put my cents in.
387      All, and I mean ALL, of my life, I have wanted nothing more than to write.
388 No riches, fans, or concubines did I pursue, only that one day someone should
389 see my by-line and say, 'Now, I think
390 this guy can write something worth
391 reading!'.  That's it.  To the letter.
392 
393 It was Hemmingway who said, 'To be a
394 writer, one must write'.  It may sound
395 simple, but the implications go deep, though that's only in the meaning to the
396 reader.  I find it hard to focus all of the ideas I have into a beam of thought,
397 and that is what plauges me.  For lack of a horse...
398 
399 I call Backwater to sharpen my senses.  No drug effects me like a 'good' call to
400 Backwater.  A cold numbs my chest and slows my respiration.  An awareness
401 encompasses me.  My jumbled ideas are grouped and I can, when dropping carrier,
402 begin to write.  Not expirament or test;really write!  I have no explination
403 for this, and want none.  It may be thatone day Backwater will no longer effect 
404 me in this manner.  If it goes down, that will surely be the case.
405 
406 I've used up my space.  Please ignore these ramblings.

424 It had been many months since THOR's last visit to the INN and as he settled
425 his square frame down upon a chair near the hub of the visitors he overheard
426 one of the visitors speak of the loss of another of THOR's favorite resting
427 spots. The Bit Bucket gone? How could this be THOR thought to himself.
428 So many friends and even some worthy foes had been met at that fine place.
429 THOR thought of the wonderful and colorful tales and stores told by the 
430 visitors he had met there and his heart felt heavy in his great chest. This was
431 indeed a sad day for such a place was hard to find where friends can exchange
432 views and ideas. Tales of Wizards, Trolls and warriors. Even a cookie eater or
433 two. Men and women shared their thoughts with not only each other but with the
434 youthful visitors who were sometimes novice in their methods and words.
435 The terrible battle scars upon THOR's mighty frame began to ache and he hurt
436 inside and out for the loss of a place to see and hear about life on this
437 world of poets and writers.
438 THOR ordered a large ale to toast the absence of BIT BUCKET and while waiting
439 for the beer keeper, set out his pipe to smoke a blend of turkish tobacco he
440 had been saving for his visit to their Inn. As the flame touched the shredded
441 tobacco it began to sparkle and snap wand THOR made a wish upon this lucky
442 sign that the BIT BUCKET would not forever be absent.

445 That aboveformentioned Tek UNIX workstation was dropped by Tek from it's 
446 product line. I think there may have been a reason for this, like speed,
447 crappy Kernel implementation and a host of other problems. As for me and
448 the Bucket, I was kicked off of said BBS after staying on one night for 
449 20 extra minutes. I don't know about you folks, but I consider this extream.
450 So yes, this could be considered a quip from a random name, but the random 
451 name comes from having known what happens when a known name says something 
452 bad about something everyone else is greaving over.

456 
457     Too bad the above comments are incorrect in their assumptions about the reasons for the demise of Tek Graphic
458 Work Stations. First of all, the Tek 6130 is *not* a discontinued product. You can ask the hundreds of customers
459 who are using the 6130 right now. I don't know where you got the idea that Rick's system was an orphan. He put it
460 together a piece at a time to save costs, not because that was the only way it was available. There is another unix box
461 in town that is an orphaned Tek product. That is a 6205, not a 6130. There is a difference even though both are based on
462 the same chip set/future bus. As for kernel implementation, let's see some credentials before you start making such
463 brash statements. The Kernel is the most important part of unix, and if you think Tek was sloppy with their modification
464 of the original National Semiconductor kernel, what's your proof? Half-truths and anonymous snide remarks just don't 
465 cut it. 
466     Marketing drives Tektronix, not engineering. This may not be the best way, but it is the way things are done. If you
467 can't understand the real reasons behind some products going to market and other products not, any discussion about the
468 success or failure of Tek's CAD/CAM effort is useless.

607 No, I ain't "R F". I don't know who that is. Yellow Donald got his name about
608 three years back when I stood on his front porch and called him out and he 
609 failed to show. All he would do was yell threats through the door. Ever since 
610 then, I, and soon everybody else, called him Yellow Donald. He raised hell
611 on the CB back then, trying to interrupt everybody's communications as best he
612 could. His reign of terror ended when I and a few friends made a raid on his
613 house with BB guns and M-100's. We managed to do some damage and after that 
614 night we hardly heard from him anymore. I think his dad shut him down. Eventually he moved but his new location was too
615 far out to bother anyone of consequence. And I don't know who this guy pretending to be him is but he does have a 

616 working knowledge of the person in question and how he acts. I just hope he isn't intending to do to backwater what
617 Yellow Donald did to channel 11.
