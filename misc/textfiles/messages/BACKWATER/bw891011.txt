 24    Something shall happen soon.  Always seems that when things are best,
 25 a disturbance comes from no-where.
 26  
 27    AD, hope you caught my message - there are 680x0's availible.
 28 Last time I saw the price of a 68010, it was roughtly $20-$25.  May
 29 seem spendy, but it may be worth it in the long run (for only a
 30 5% speed increase on the same clock?  Who am I kidding?...)
 31 but a 68000 will run you for $12.00, and several are availible from
 32 third party venders.  A word of warning!  Some third-party chip
 33 fabricators do not pass as 100% functional!  I remember (somewhere)
 34 reading about how a licenced manf. had the rights to fabricate 
 35 "work-alike" chips, but there was something apperently wrong with
 36 the actual masks themselves, so several hundred thousand 68000
 37 chips came out with "reliability" problems.  Some would crash any
 38 system they were installed on with bus errors, etc. - again, something
 39 to do with the internal electronics and the bus handling.  The
 40 problem was quickly remedied, as I recall.  As for a source, try:

 63    He was tired.  The "day" had seemed long, but it bothered him
 64 little.  Sleep was the gremlin in is mind, not boredom - so he 
 65 considered bedding down.  He also knew that in a few minutes, his
 66 mind would suddenly awake, to find a body exhausted and in slight pain.
 67 His concentration was lapsing - which ment that he was now floating -
 68 causing him to ooze here and there, especially at his digits.  Regaining
 69 composture, he sits into the lotus, and focuses on his "body".  The
 70 "digits" reformed, but he was still lacking toenails. (I'm too tired,
 71 and I'm not content with my State of Being.  I shall have to
 72 return to a physical form soon, and reliquish my "body" of energy).
 73 Still sitting in the lotus, he beings his breathing, then preperations,
 74 and finally, locks his existence into being with a mantra.  Sleep
 75 ocassionally scared him with the prospect of disolving into electrons
 76 or other such nonsense, but with the concentration (on the mantra)
 77 and the relaxation of this "body" into a sphere, he was able to
 78 sle, in a crude way.  A sometimes painful way.  But it worked.

 82    Unlike most, Hagbard had to leave before he could complete his
 83 tutorage at the monestary.  It was an amazing and cheerful place -
 84 Bhuddists, Yogis, Fakkirs, and the like, walking, thinking, and
 85 rarely talking.  Because of this, he is unable to complete higher
 86 brain functions.  When he returned, the monestary was razed to the ground
 87 by a mob of soldiers.  He fled Tibet, and seeked asylum in the 
 88 United States.  Sometimes, uncommonly, he would privately mourn the
 89 loss of his instructors and friends, but he could only stand at a 
 90 distance and contemplate, and soon enough, he would abandon the
 91 thoughts to concentration on another obstacle.  Namely, the
 92 continuation of his instruction by the few in the U.S., but none
 93 had the remaining training and he had already surpased all in this
 94 respect.  So, he remained, the last person to hold the understanding
 95 of being, yet unable to affect it.
 96    Such knowledge occationally burdoned him, yet he could handle this
 97 by applying meta-programming, the ability to re-condition behavior at
 98 will.  It was the 6th highest, with 8 levels of knowledge already learned.  Lit
 99 (oops) little did he know that it was the last level, number 8.

109 I too missed the PCS Social.  Unfortunately, moving woes and seemingly
110 impossible (yet tiny) problems at work (Test Director II-- just when
111 you thought it was safe to design tests) piled up on me the first week
112 of this month.  I'll make it to the next one, however, or know the
113 reason why.
114 As for writing, I find that I am suffering from some sort of block, an
115 inability to sit down and let the mind roam free in search of ideas.
116 I haven't written anything in months; I feel I should- but somehow,
117 the words do not flow as they once did.  It seems odd that I can know
118 of an inability but not know how to circumvent it.  Perhaps a vacation?

144  
145 as someone who doesn't have alot of time to spend bbs'ing, i've popped in 
146 and out of bw and blue parrot. i always seem to drop by in the middle of
147 these 'remember when we..' and 'whatever happen to...' discussions. they're
148 rather intimidating in the sense that it seems to be assumed that the
149 new people could never hope to live up to those great times.
150  
151 one thing that i have learned: each day is unique. and no matter how good
152 yesterday was, i am *here* today and it is up to me (and no one else) to
153 make *today* a good day.
154  
155 sure, it's nice to remember the good times and to learn from the not so
156 good times but some people never seem to leave this mode and i have to
157 wonder, what are they doing to make today memorable.
158  
159 each day is an exciting new possibility - what are doing to make your
160 dreams come true?
161  
162    -all i ask for in this life
163      is to follow my dreams        (i'm sure somebody said this or some-

181    Monday begins the countdown for Tuesday's lift off of the shuttle Atlantis 
182 and the Galileo probe to Jupiter. Blastoff of Atlantis is scheduled at Kennedy 
183 Space Center at 12:57 p.m. EDT. Activists, unhappy with last week's ruling

239 10/18/89 By The Associated Press
240    Here is a summary of developments in the earthquake that rocked Northern
241 California Tuesday:
242    ------
243    THE QUAKE
244    The earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. PDT, registering 6.9 on Richter scale, and
245 was centered on the San Andreas Fault about eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz
246 and 75 miles south of San Francisco.
247    ------
248    CASUALTIES
249    At least 272 people died, and 650 were injured. Of the dead, 253 were killed
250 when the upper level of two-tiered Interstate 880 in Oakland collapsed onto the
251 lower level.
252    ------
253    DAMAGE
254    The quake collapsed buildings, broke windows, and caused other damage across
255 nearly 100 miles.
256    Severed gas lines started fires. One spectacular fire in San Francisco burne
257 a block of buildings and another damaged downtown Berkeley.
258    Power, telephone, water and other services were disrupted for at least 1
259 million people.
260    The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and two bridges near Santa Cruz
261 collapsed. The San Mateo and Dumbarton bridges were closed for inspection.
262    Highways were damaged and mountain passes outside Santa Cruz were closed due
263 to landslides and fissures in the roads.
264    Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy said damages would total "the better part of $1
265 billion."
266    ------
267    LOOTING
268    Some looting was reported in San Francisco and in Los Gatos, a town between
269 San Jose and Santa Cruz, but no arrests were made.
270    ------
271    FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
272    President Bush signed a disaster relief declaration for seven counties in th
273 Bay area and dispatched Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to join Vice
274 President Quayle in California to assess damage.
275    Military officials mobilized National Guard units to aid the rescue.
276    The Federal Emergency Management Agency set up a disaster field office in Th
277 Presidio, an Army post in San Francisco.
278    Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the armed forces to set up an emergenc
279 group to help coordinate aid efforts.
280    ------
281    WORLD REACTION
282    The Soviet Union made an unprecedented offer of relief aid and President
283 Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent condolences in a telegram to President Bush.
284    Offers of aid came from the Philippines, Japan, France, Britain, Switzerland
285 and several other nations.
286    Pope John Paul II was "deeply saddened" and praying for the victims.
287    ------
288    WORLD SERIES
289    Baseball fans awaiting the start of Game Three of the World Series evacuated
290 Candlestick Park, which sustained structural damage. No major injuries were
291 reported and there was no word on when the game would be played.

294              10/17/89 By SALLY CARPENTER HALE Associated Press Writer
295    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Opponents of U.S. military aid to Central America
296 demonstrated outside a hotel where Vice President Dan Quayle was speaking, and
297 21 people were arrested.
298    Several of those arrested were later injured in a traffic accident as they
299 were being taken to jail. Protester Robin Terry said the worst injury was a
300 broken leg and that all of the protesters had been released from a hospital by
301 today.
302    "There were about 200 protesters out there. I would say out of respect for
303 the office of vice president there should have been 500," Quayle quipped during
304 his appearance at a Republican fund-raiser at a downtown hotel.
305    Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said it was the largest
306 demonstration against Quayle since he's been vice president and the only
307 demonstration that disrupted his schedule. Quayle left the hotel a half hour
308 late.
309    The protest began as a "die-in," with 11 demonstrators wearing red-stained
310 clothes lying on the sidewalk in front of the hotel.
311    When police asked them to move, the protesters tried to push their way
312 through the doors, chanting: "Bush, Quayle, we know you; Hitler was elected,
313 too."
314    Police used nightsticks to quell the demonstration. "It was hats and bats an
315 shoving and pushing," said a police officer who didn't give his name.
316    Earlier, Quayle dropped in at an FBI news conference to praise investigators
317 efforts in breaking up a drug ring.
318    "What you've been able to accomplish is part of the strategy of President
319 Bush in his war against drugs," he told law enforcement officers from several
320 agencies. "We're not going to give up until that war is won."
321    The news conference was called to announce the seizure of $150 million worth
322 of tar heroin and cocaine on the West Coast.
323    Isn't it interesting how the drug problem continues, but when the Republican
324 Boy is in town, they can manage to bust a major drug ring?  Coincidence?  Or
325 Political timing?  Lee Atwater was unavailable for comment.

327 10/12/89: NASA CONFIRMS '89 OZONE HOLE MATCHES '87 RECORD
328 RELEASE:  89-160 (Update from release 89-152).
329  
330      Continuing observations by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) 
331 have confirmed that the ozone hole over the Antarctic this year has equalled

334      Dr. Arlin Krueger, Dr. Richard Stolarski and Dr. Mark Schoeberl, 
335 scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., have been 
336 closely monitoring ozone levels over the Southern Hemisphere with the TOMS, an 
337 instrument on board NASA's NIMBUS-7 satellite. 
338  
339  
340      Previous measurements had indicated this year's hole might 
341  
342 be as severe as the 1987 hole, and a record low ozone level was 
343  
344 reached on Oct. 5.  Krueger, the TOMS prinicipal investigator, 
345  
346 said, "It's becoming clear that the ozone hole is not going away 
347  
348 in the near future, although the depth will vary from year to 
349  
350 year."  The depth of the ozone hole each year will be determined 
351  
352 by meteorological conditions, such as temperature and winds.

372   10/19/89 By STEVE WILSTEIN Associated Press Writer
373    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mayor Art Agnos said he was "ticked off" that Vice
374 President Dan Quayle had time for television cameras but not for him during a
375 tour of earthquake-damaged areas of the city.
376    Quayle, who promised federal relief for earthquake victims after visiting th
377 Bay area Wednesday, today dismissed the liberal Democratic mayor's criticism.
378    "I would hope that the mayor would resist any kind of political rhetoric at
379 this time and concentrate all the energies and all of our dedication to helping
380 the victims and helping the families of the victims, and let's get the situatio
381 stabilized first," Quayle said on CBS's "This Morning."
382    And on NBC's "Today" show, he said that he thought it was "very unfortunate
383 to take that kind of a shot at a very difficult time. ... I was there to help
384 people."
385    Agnos said Wednesday he was "ticked off" that Quayle "flies around in a
386 helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots" but didn't meet with him. The
387 mayor had said before Quayle's visit that he planned to meet with Quayle to urg
388 immediate federal help.
389    "I understand he was in the Marina and in the shelters and then left. If he
390 did so without visiting the mayor, I have real questions about what he was doin
391 here. It may have been just a publicity stunt," Agnos said.
392    President Bush said today he would go to the Bay area on Friday and
393 presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Agnos would be invited to a
394 session between Bush and local officials.
395    Fitzwater denied that the Republican vice president had snubbed Agnos.
396    Agnos was invited to two meetings with Quayle "and he declined to attend bot
397 meetings," Fitzwater said.
398    Furthermore, "we offered to send a helicopter to pick him up wherever he was
399 and deliver him to the meetings and he declined that."
400    White House chief of staff John Sununu has "been trying to reach him on the
401 phone for several days and he has declined to talk to us," Fitzwater said. "We
402 regret very much that the mayor of San Francisco has decided not to cooperate
403 with us in this matter."
404    Quayle met with officials in Alameda County across San Francisco Bay to
405 assess the need for federal assistance.
406    On his tour, Quayle appeared stunned by the magnitude of damage and loss of
407 life inflicted by the temblor. Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, spent six hours
408 touring the area by helicopter and on foot after President Bush authorized
409 federal disaster assistance.
410    Upon his return to Washington late Wednesday, Quayle said that federal aid
411 would be forthcoming.
412    Quayle, accompanied by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and Sen. Pete
413 Wilson, R-Calif., met with mayors of more than half a dozen cities around the
414 bay and emergency officials at the Alameda Naval Air Station.
415    "My impression was one of great sadness for the number of people that lost
416 their lives and the families that are impacted," Quayle said after seeing
417 crushed cars on collapsed portions of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and
418 Interstate 880 in Oakland.
419    "You can't help but be impressed by the magnitude of the earthquake," he
420 said. "To see 880 flattened like a pancake, it's really a sobering sight."
421

423

425 Just ducking in between the news postings. Looks like a down cycle right
426 now.
427  
428 Interesting bit of trivia : Don't buy those bench marks that say the
429 '386sx is only about 90% as fast as an equivalent '286. If you put the
430 '386sx in virtual 8086 mode it is faster then an equivalent '386 in that
431 mode, and nearly as fast as a '386 running in '386 mode. Needless to say
432 it blows away an equivalent '286.
433  
434 Note that chip revisions can lead to slight improvments in performance.
435 Thats probable why the '386sx is slightly faster then a '386 in non
436 32 bit tests. Newer 386's are probable as fast at the same clock rate
437 as the '386sx.
438  
439 ch probable probably.

475 Technological failures Source: USA TODAY/Gannett National Information Network
476    The computerization age changed the way business was done: hand ledgers are 
477 outdated and customers' names are recalled using a computer screen instead of 
478 one's memory. The computer industry has been rocked in the last several weeks 
479 by natural disasters.
480 HAS TECHNOLOGY BEEN DOUBTED?
481    The earthquake in Northern California, Hurricane Hugo and the threat of a 
482 "Friday the 13th" computer virus showed the vulnerability of technology. Tari 
483 Schneider, president of Contingency Planning Research Inc., a firm that sets 
484 up backup computer sites for disaster victims, said the events shook the 
485 computer industry. 
486 WHY ARE COMPUTERS SO FRAGILE?
487    Computers and phones function by electrical wires that are susceptible to 
488 nature. Wires above the ground are often the first to go in disasters. 
489 HOW ABOUT WATER AS POWER?
490    The  majority of the nation's 16,000 mainframe computers that run big banks 
491 and brokerages are liquid-cooled, which means cold water is necessary to 
492 operate them. If pipelines or underground tanks rupture, they can be knocked 
493 out of service indefinitely. 
494 WHAT EFFECT HAS NATURE HAD?
495    Nature's impact can range from minor to devastating. U.S. companies have 
496 always been at the mercy of the natural elements: fire, water (floods), earth 
497 (quakes) and air (hurricanes). Now that computers and phone networks are 
498 essential to businesses, firms are at the mercy of a fifth: technology 
499 outages. 
500 DO FIRMS HAVE BACKUP PLANS?
501    Many firms in the nation set up backup computing centers called "hot sites."
502 These sometimes entombed sites contain computers that can take over data-
503 processing chores when disaster strikes. 
504 ANY WORKING IN SAN FRANCISCO?
505    Yes, many took effect Wednesday when firms shifted their business centers. 
506 One San Francisco bank is now running its data processing operations on 
507 computers in Toronto. 
508 HOW ABOUT SECURITY MEASURES?
509    Many of the sites that house main-frame computers are well-protected. In 
510 Tulsa, American Airlines constructed a $34 million underground facility to 
511 house its mainframes. The facility has a 42-inch-thick ceiling and 12-inch 
512 thick concrete walls. Admittance is only granted after passing a "retina scan" 
513 - a James Bond-like device that identifies you by scanning the blood vessels 
514 in your eyes. 
515 WHAT IS THE WORST OUTAGE?
516    When the telephone lines go, then a firm usually is in trouble because 
517 computers can always run on a backup. 
518 WHAT IS COST OF PHONE LOSS?
519    If the phones go down at a major airline or investment house, the losses can
520 be as great as $6 million an hour, says Donna Lee, director of network 
521 operations at AT&T. 
522 WHAT IS VULNERABLE? 
523    All service operations - banks, insurance firms, newspapers -are vulnerable 
524 to a telecommunications breakdown. Manufacturing firms also rely on phones to 
525 order supplies for assembly. 
526 WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF LINKING?
527    A local disaster can have rippleeffects nationwide because of the 
528 interconnecting technologies. On May 8, 1988, fire struck a Hinsdale, Ill., 
529 telephone switching station. Suddenly, air-traffic controllers at O'Hare 
530 Airport couldn't communicate with controllers in other cities. Flights were 
531 delayed throughout the country. Unable to call in or out, Chicago-area 
532 businesses lost an estimated $500 million in sales. 
533 WHAT PROTECTION IS TAKEN?
534    AT&T routes its calls through 100 heavily protected switching stations, 
535 housed in 200-foot square buildings. Just three stations serve the entire San 
536 Francisco Bay area. Among other AT&T's defenses: double backups for every 
537 switching center and computer systems that route long-distance calls through 
538 any of 21 different pathways.
539                                                                                
540 As Lee Atwater, chairman of the National Republican Committee said:  "It is m
541 truly a shame that those who complain the loudest and most frequently about
542 other people's postings on Backwater, never post anything themselves, but 
543 their complaints."                                                             
544

552 More on the '386sx. I'm not sure that the virtual 8086 mode explains
553 the speed of the '386sx.
554  
555 At work I recently got a tandy 4000sx. Out of the box it ran at about
556 15.2 MHZ relative to a '286. Sort of slow, but much faster then the
557 vanila 6MHZ True IBM AT I had been using. About a week after getting
558 it I ran setupsx, which is the sx specific version of the standard dos
559 setup. (Atleast for tandy 4000sx's) At about the same time I also
560 got the upgrade to the turbo debuger and turbo Pascal. Once they where 
561 installed I set my computer up to use the debuger. (I have multiple 
562 enviorments, as some of the software I use conflicts with other 
563 software.) This meant that I loaded the boreland virtual 8086 driver. 
564 At about that time I ran some benchmarks. Suddenly I was getting a 
565 17.6 on the norton SI index, and around 43 MHZ relative to an 8088.
566 Of course I attributed it to the virtual 8086 mode.
567  
568 This morning I went in to work, booted up my computer and noticed that
569 it had slowed back down to the more ussual 15.2 or so MHZ relative to
570 a '286. So on a hunch I ran setupsx again. Bingo, it was in turbo mode
571 upon reboot.
572  
573 Now I can't argue with the performance increase, but I really do wonder
574 where it's coming from. It's as real as about 6 different bench marks
575 can prove. So, Any ideas?

590    Barbara Boxer, Democratic congresswoman from California, and Dennis L. 
591 Cuddy, free-lance writer, discuss their views. 
592    CUDDY: "President Bush is right to veto federal funding of abortions in 
593 case of rape or incest. ... Bush must veto abortion funding because not to do 
594 so would mean government would be imposing a `pro-choice' morality upon the 
595 many taxpayers who don't want their money used for this killing." (What about 
596 those taxpayers that object to the B-2 bomber or the Contras being supported 
597 with their tax money?  Isn't a "killing morality" being forced on them?)

599 has endorsed a double standard based on wealth, connections and power. ... It 
600 is bad policy, bad politics and bad news."

605 Bah!  It is a waste of valuable space. Have you considered that maybe the

627    To the creature that posts repeat news found on CNN:
628  
629    In an effort of good faith and utter hopelessness, I ask kindly that
630 you limit yourself to 3 "small" news postings (10-20 lines per post), or
631 2 "medium" postings (20-30 lines), or 1 "large" posting (less than 60
632 lines) per disk.  I myself find the newservice sometimes annoying, but
633 I ask that you observe your behavior, and learn a new word:
634 "moderation".  In moderation, along with occassional (sp) tact, you will
635 find a greater acceptance of your work(?) in a place where most work
636 is inspirational, ad hoc, sharing, witty, and caring, and otherwise
637 enjoyable to the avid reader.  There is nothing wrong with the
638 news, nor is there a problem with posing questions with the day's
639 events.  But if BackWater is interested enough, it would have its
640 OWN live newsfeed to share with its users. (pardon grammar)
641  
642    If you wish to catch the fancy of the passer-by, try posting a
643 question(able) line after each news posting, or a witty response.  I
644 think you will probably find many people paying much more attention to

657 10/22/89 By MITCHELL LANDSBERG Associated Press Writer
658    In a simpler time, not so long ago, environmentalists talked about saving
659 forests for hiking, streams for rafting and clean air for the pure enjoyment of
660 breathing it.
661    Now, as the 1990s approach, the talk has turned to the science of survival -
662 saving forests for oxygen, keeping streams from spreading toxic pollutants,
663 cleaning the air to avoid catastrophic global warming.
664    From the hazy vantage point of 1989, the environment looms as the major
665 global issue of the next decade. The threat of an environmental cataclysm is
666 replacing nuclear holocaust as the scariest menace to civilization.
667    The World Bank, long dismissed by environmentalists as ecologically
668 insensitive, now calls the environment its leading priority for the 1990s.
669 President Bush called the '90s "the era for clean air."
670    And the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization, calls
671 the 1990s "the turnaround decade" in which people will either stop polluting or
672 face an environmental disaster as devastating as nuclear war.
673    "By many measures, time is running out," Worldwatch warned in its "State of
674 the World 1989" report.
675    Not everyone shares Worldwatch's apocalyptic vision, which is based largely
676 on the threat of global warming -- the "greenhouse effect." Many respected
677 scientists say the available evidence doesn't warrant the doomsday warnings.
678    But few doubt that environmental issues will be paramount in the coming
679 years. If nothing else, the '90s are likely to be a decade of unprecedented
680 research into environmental problems as scientists try to solve 19th- and 20th-
681 century problems before people start mucking up the 21st.
682    The environmental agenda in the '90s will include:
683    --Clean air. Perhaps no environmental issue will be as sharply felt. In Los
684 Angeles, authorities will try to change a way of life by starting to wean
685 commuters off gasoline-powered automobiles in the 1990s. The rest of the nation
686 undoubtedly will follow that lead. Already, a congressional committee has voted
687 to adopt California's tough new standards for anti-pollution equipment on cars.
688    --Ozone depletion. In cities, ozone is a toxic pollutant spewed out by cars,
689 but high in the atmosphere it's a vital gas shielding the Earth from dangerous
690 ultraviolet rays. That shield is being destroyed by yet another human pollutant
691 -- chlorofluorocarbons -- and the consequences are expected to include increase
692 rates of skin cancer and cataracts.
693    --Extinction of species. Largely because of the burning of tropical rain
694 forests, entire species of animals, plants and insects are becoming extinct at
695 the fastest rate in human history.
696    All these concerns will be secondary, however, to the one overriding issue
697 that touches them all -- global warming.
698    The greenhouse theory has been around for two centuries, but suddenly became
699 the stuff of newspaper headlines during the hot, dry summer of 1988 in the
700 United States.
701    The idea is that certain gases in the atmosphere act like the glass on a
702 greenhouse. They let sunlight in, but won't let its heat out. The biggest
703 villain is carbon dioxide, which is released when trees are destroyed and when
704 fossil fuels such as oil or coal are burned.
705    Scientists almost universally agree that the gases will cause the Earth to
706 get warmer. "The greenhouse effect is not a hypothesis or anything; it's one of
707 the best-established facts about the way the world works," said Gus Steth,
708 president of the World Resources Institute.
709    That's where the agreement ends; the fights begin when experts try to guess
710 when the warming will occur and how bad it will be.
711    Some, such as Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for
712 Atmospheric Research, argue that the greenhouse effect has already begun and
713 will have devastating effects in the next century unless radical action is
714 taken.
715    Without such action, Schneider envisions a starkly different world by the
716 middle of the next century, one in which the average global temperature will
717 have risen by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit.
718    Oceans would rise, deserts would spread, forests would die. People would
719 starve.
720    "Such a change," Schneider wrote recently in Scientific American magazine,
721 "would be unprecedented in human history; it would match the (9-degree) warming
722 since the peak of the last ice age 18,000 years ago but would take effect
723 between 10 and 100 times faster."
724    It's too late to stop the warming altogether, Schneider argues, but the wors
725 of it could be averted if people cut back drastically in their use of fossil
726 fuels and stopped destroying rain forests.
727    Other scientists believe such warnings are premature.
728    Richard Lindzen, a meteorology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
729 Technology, argues that climate scientists are operating in a vacuum, not a
730 greenhouse. He said they lack the facts to back up claims about global warming.
731    "You know very well we can't predict the weather with any certainty," Lindze
732 said with a chuckle.
733    His forecast for the '90s: continued scientific fogginess with a chance of
734 clearing by the end of the decade.
735    Schneider's forecast is considerably more ominous.
736    "Six of the warmest years in the last 100 occurred in the '80s," he said
737 recently at a meeting of chemists in Miami. "And I'll give you odds that the
738 '90s will be warmer than the '80s."
739    That sort of prognosticating doesn't impress the greenhouse skeptics.
740    "Nobody in their right mind would make a forecast like that," said Andrew
741 Solow, a climate statistician at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
742 Massachusetts. "There's just no way you can make that claim."
743    Solow said he has pored over the statistics and cannot find any basis for
744 claims that the greenhouse effect has begun. The warmer temperatures in the
745 1980s, he believes, are probably part of a natural upswing; the greenhouse
746 effect could be centuries off.
747    What if the heat continues, if temperature records continue to topple throug
748 the 1990s, if Schneider's forecast comes true? Would he become a believer then?
749    "I'd be pretty convinced," Solow said.
750                                                                                
751    As Lee Atwater may have once said:  "It is interesting that those who 
752 protest the loudest, longest, and most frequently are those who apparently
753 are unable to read.  And they seem to have difficulty distinguishing fantasy
754 from fact.  I have trouble following stories that aren't going on too."

806                                  JIM BAKKER
807  
808  
809         October 25, 1989
810  
811         Dear Jim,
812  
813            Gosh, that was a tough break you got at the sentencing
814         hearing yesterday. Fourty-five years is a pretty stiff
815         sentence for a man with so many nice suits - especially after
816         you insisted so strenuously that you were innocent and that
817         God had forgiven you. Come to think of it...if you WERE
818         innocent, then why would God NEED to forgive you? No matter.
819         Once the hog came out of the tunnel it was clear to everyone
820         that God Almighty and Judge "Maximum Bob" Potter have been
821         working from completely different agendas all along.
822  
823            Prison life will definitely be a change of pace, Jim.
824         People in there will say things to yohthat are not polite,
825         and they may neglect to use the title "Reverend". Chit-chat
826         out in the exercise yard may go something more along the
827         lines of : "Hey! Preacher Boy! Yew gotta pretty little mouth,
828         anybody ever tole yew that? C'mon over here. Hey!"  If you
829         thought bending over for strip searches in the Federal
830         Psychiatric Hospital was unsavory, wait till "Bubba" from
831         Cellblock D decides to make you his personal houseboy. "Turn
832         the other cheek" takes on a whole new meaning in the dark
833         world of federal corrections, and it's not something you'll
834         want to base a sermon on.
835  
836 {           Try not to fret too much, Jim. A fourty-five year sentence
837         isn't that bad - except for that unfortunate ten year
838         minimum. Bummer. You may see some cold-blooded murderers get
839         paroled before you do, but so what? Maybe by then you'll be
840         buddies and they'll make phone calls for you when they get
841         outside. You'll surely get paroled after your full "dime of
842         hard time" is served...if you mind your manners.
843  
844            So cheer up, Jim, and look at the bright side - you won't
845         have to wake up next to Tammy Faye again until late 1999.
846  
847         Sincerely,
848

988      10/27/89 - TICKER TAPE FLOODS BACKWATER, AUTHORS PANIC!
989  
990      In a bold move today, an unarmed assailant burst into the Backwater 
991 Message System, carrying only a large ticker tape machine.  Threatening the
992 authors present with a magnet, he promptly set up the machine and began a 
993 steady flow of ticker tape news items throughout the entire network of BWMS,
994 utterly clogging literary traffic for days.
995      "We just weren't expecting something like that tever happen," one 
996 anonymouus writer commented during routin questioning.  "I mean, look, usually 
997 we get a few hack authors, but nothing  this dramatic.  You'd think there'd be 
998 a law against something like this."
