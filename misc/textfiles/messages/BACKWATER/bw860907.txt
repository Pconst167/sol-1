21      The differenece between love and hate is not so great. They live side 
22 by side, one always struggling with the other. When love is strong and 
23 shows its range, the beauty of the world opens up and surrounds us. 
24      But when love is supressed. When it is hidden. When it is striken and 
25 held inside, foul hatred rises to take its place. The expanse of the world 
26 is lost and it reduces down to a narrow tunnel of vision. Only the hatred 
27 is visible, only the wrong is known. 
28      It is so easy to switch from love to hate that often we don't even 
29 realize it. It enters our lives in an insidious fashion, filling the cracks 
30 and nooks in out heads when love retreats and the anger of the world seeps 
31 in. And like water in crevises of a rock it sits and waits biding its time 
32 for when the cold winter season sets in. Then it does its worse breaking 
33 apart the bonds of grace and strength. Leaving our emotions scattered and 
34 destroyed. Leaving only only shattered hopes and dreams. 
35      Then is when hatred paints its image in our minds, giving reason where 
36 none exists. Filling the void left by the lost vision of love and hope. 
37 Then hate works to finish what it has begun, feeding on the lost and 
38 ravaged vision of the past. Breaking the mind into small grains of sand, 
39 until nothing is left but a warped image, a ghost of the past, and all our 
40 hopes and dreams lay as shards at out feet.
41      Can this be changed? Yes, but it isn't easy. It requires great 
42 strength and desire to build anew, to find new and stronger foundations to 
43 build anew. Build incorporating pieces of the past, or leave them behind 
44 and start fresh, but don't let the cold snows of hatred deter you. A solid 
45 foundation is important. Begin with a thought and form you can believe in 
46 and hold as your own for all time. For the stronger the foundation, the 
47 greater the strength against the storms that will always test you. 
48      You build with joy, love, and faith on a foundation of sense and 
49 purpose. It is long and at times tedious, but in the end it is more then 
50 worth it, for it provides you with a strength and vitality, a sense of well 
51 being that is unachieveable in any other way. 
52      You can start easily today, just look out your window, or step outside 
53 and see the wonderous beauty that mother nature gives us. See the clear 
54 blue sky, the fluffy white clouds, the rich green of the leaves on the 
55 trees. When it rains see the rainbow it brings. Don't just look at these, 
56 see them, know them for what they are. They are there for you to enjoy, so 
57 revel in their existance, and love the wonders that life has to bring. 
58 
59              Remember, the world sees you as you see yourself.
60 
61      Stiring, I looked up at the dying flames of the hearth. What an odd 
62 dream, what did it mean? Oh, I had seen the death, hate and suffering many 
63 times of those I knew and had known, I knew all of that, and I knew what 
64 that aspect of the dream ment, I have lived it often enough in my own past. 
65 But why did I dream of such things now? To what purpose, to what end was 
66 this displayed before me now? Perhaps it is simply the rememberance of 
67 good and dear friends brought on by the flickering flames in the great 
68 hearth of the Inn. 
69      Getting up, I gathered an arm full of solid Alder and Birch to feed 
70 the fire. Stiring the embers to encourage the fire to the logs, I then 
71 moved back to relax in my chair again to enjoy the warmth that it always 
72 brought. As I watched, the flames grew and licked at the logs, the mosses 
73 and lichean clinging to the bark crackling and emitting sparks and bright 
74 flashes. The flames grew and grew, hideing the logs, filling the fireplace 
75 with a flickering yellow-white light.

109     Sometimes Love leaves and hate fills the void, but sometimes isn't everytime. The cliche' rings true: 'Tis better to have
110 loved and lost than to never have loved at all. How else can Man and Woman ever experience the truly important emotional
111 state of Love? Being bombarded on all sides as to how black the time after love can be, many are scared of ever letting
112 down their defenses and letting Love enter.
113     Our Western mind has a strange idea of Love. It has its origins in medieval times when knight and lady strode arm in arm
114 betwixt and between Dragons and Robber Barons. Love was an exciting breathtaking experience! Leave that plain, albeit steady
115 feeling older couples had for each other behind. This fresh, invigorating dash of romantic love was the true emotion. And
116 when this brightly burning candle goes out, so be it. Love is through. Time for the depression, the blackness, the void where
117 hate might gain a stronghold.
118     Does this approach sound good? Is the continual thirst for high romance the
119 rock a lasting, loving relationship should be built on? As the excitement diminishes, and there is no avoiding that, all that
120 is built on that is in jeopardy. A relationship should not be devoid of romantic love, quite the opposite, that is where it
121 will start. But we must learn to move beyond that initial ecstasy into the realm of the steady, assured, long-time Love that 
122 lasts, and leave no room for hate. It is at this point when we have truly, honestly found Love, the all-powerful force within
123 all of us.
124     Then Love is boring, some might say. What is better, the emotional tides of romantic love, where our insides are awash
125 one day with romance and the next day with hate, or the steadfast caring of a loved-one who will always be there, needing,
126 helping, listening, and Loving?
127     Perhaps this ideal is too difficult to live. We are all masochists then, because that higheplateau of existence will
128 never be available to us on our current path.

140 CONTRARY TO THE OPINION OF SOME, THE EDITING OF BACKWATER IS BY NO MEANS
141 RANDOM. THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF EDITING DONE:
142 1. REMOVAL OF EXCESSIVE BLANK LINES (AND OTHER ATTEMPTS TO FILL THE BOARD
143    AND PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING ENTRIES).
144 2. PROFANITY & OBSCENITIES AND OTHER OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL (SEE THE FIRST
145    NINETEEN LINES OF EACH DISK).
146 3. RE-UPLOADS OF OLD MATERIAL (MOSTLY BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY WASTES SPACE, BUT
147    ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN UPLOADED BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL
148    AUTHOR & THIS PERSON OR PERSONS ARE TRYING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR SOMEONE
149    ELSE'S WORK)

151 OCCASIONALLY A LEGITIMATE MSG WILL GET REMOVED WHILE THE JUNK IS BEING CLEANED

307 Is everybody having problems with the people they love or does it just appear
308 that way?  I too am at a rough point in my life,  I love one,  but she loves
309 another.  What am I to do?  I've asked myself this many times,  and still no
310 answer.  If I could I would just leave,  that would be best for them,  but I
311 am not sure as to how she feels about me.  Besides,  I do not think I could
312 stand to be away from her forever.  She is all I can think about,  I dream
313 about her whenever I sleep,  I see her face when I'm not sleeping.  Is this
314 love?  What do I do?  Do I fight for her?  Do I try to forget about her?
315 No,  I've tried that before,  won't work.  Maybe I should join the army and
316 make a career out of it?  So many things I could do,  all of them painful.
317 Life was so simple before I met her.  I wish I could take her in my arms and
318 make her forget about all else.  She knows how I feel yet she doesn't know
319 what I should do,  she doesn't want me to leave even though I've told her that
320 if I stay near her my feelings will grow.  What do I do?

327 What do you do? What any sane person would do. Go shoot the guy she likes then
328 be a big hero type by ostensibly solving the murder. Then give her some flowers,
329 act tough, and voila! She'll fall into your arms. ( Or bed, whichever you feel
330 is more important.) Of course, you might have the trouble of finding a patsy 
331 to push the killing off on. I suppose you could find some bum down on Burnside 
332 and make him out to be the heavy, but that wouldn't be dramatic. You need 
333 gunplay, shooting, death scenes in which your love takes her wounded knight 
334 inot her arms and heart and suddenly,   passionately, loves him. 
335 
336 ( this, by the way, is that romantic love that someone else was saying was 
337 needless and stupid. I doubt that any relationship could start without passion 
338 and excitement.)

402   Just got back from the Journey concert,  WHAT A SHOW!!  My ears are still
403 ringing.....  Anybody else out there see it?   How about when they did
404 Jailhouse rock?  I almost fell off my seat.  Kinda took me by suprise.
405 Mike (different Mike):  I've stepped up my working out with the chucks,
406 haven't even hit myself in the past week.  Still gotta work on the left
407 arm but my right arm is doing fine,  you wouldn't believe how quick I'm
408 getting.  I'm just waiting for the one time that I DO hit myself,  it'll
409 probably end up with a broken arm,  oh well,  as they say,  no pain, no
410 gain.   Hmm,  maybe I should continue this on a different system,  one
411 with E-mail.

430    MORE BITTERSWEET DREAMS...
431 
432 "In Praise of Rainbows"
433 
434 I would have taken my fury out on myself
435 in barefoot torment
436 across the soggy leaf mush which squales
437 as Wheaties do when left alone in milk
438 but bites as breakfast cereal never could.
439 My face: two black river
440 map lines, a nowhere topography,
441 a legacy of sudden death. I would have died,
442 but there are painters of promises
443 who paint streaks of color in queer
444 places where masochists hide,
445 drowning in leaves where grey prevails,
446 as if they knew leaves, and grey,
447 as if someone had told them of me.
448                                                                      
449 "The Conversationalist"
450 
451 i meet myself rarely nowadays
452    only in unlit alleys
453 dark street corners or
454 empty backrooms
455 
456 it wasn't like this when i was a kid
457    teachers did not question
458 if i talked to the wall
459 cried for no reason or
460 screamed at no one in particular
461 
462 and it wasn't like this when i was a wife's husband
463    with three children and a litter of cats
464 when i could sit myself down
465 in a black vinyl chair
466 to talk back to t.v. announcers or
467 radio newscasters
468 
469 but now with the boys grown
470 Allison dead
471 and my hair grey and balding
472    i am careful to introduce myself to me
473                                                                 
474 
475      CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM WELCOME, ALTHOUGH THESE POEMS ARE WRITTEN
476 FOR ME, AND I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THEM.
477 
478      LOVE,

503   I thought as much,  I guess 555 didn't expect me to supply requested info.
504 But wouldn't it be nice if it's just that he hasn't logged back on yet??  I
505 know,  this sounds like I live for stuff like this,  well,  I don't,  I'm just
506 sick and tired of what he says and does.  But,  I'm not planning on moving 
507 anytime in the near future so if he wants,  he can find me here.  Who knows,
508 maybe this little incident will make him shut up forever??  Wouldn't be any
509 great loss to BW.  I gotta learn to control my temper better,  this is stupid.

514 To the lovelorn:
515 	     Life seems to be not worth living when you have lost your love.  Suicide
516 doesn't seem like such a bad idea.  It's really easy to do something rash.  Pain
517 is simply part of life.  No one ever promised that life would be easy or comfortable.
518 However, not all is lost.  Grieve.  It is good for you.  It is the only way that
519 you can start to go on with your life.
520 I would recommend to you a book called "Good Grief".  Even though it is geared
521 to those who have lost a loved one through death, the principles therein surely
522 apply to anyone who has "lost" someone.
523 
524 What it comes down to is this:  life and the world go on.  You will, too.  You
525 will be enriched by the experience of pain and loss.  You will love again.
526 
527 That's difficult message to swallow for artists and romantics, but it is true
528 nonetheless.  Take it from an artist and romantic!

532 """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
533 Sure, but what about when the 'love lost' is, in whole or in part, the World.
534 Life.  Living in this place?
535 
536 Can you really get into a book?  I can.  I read for hours on end, shut up in
537 my hovel (<-dramatic words!) like a rat nibbling at cheese, I can soak up the
538 plot and involvment of protagonist and antagonist page after page.  And now,
539 after finishing a series of really good works, I find myself haunted by this
540 vivid wish:
541 
542 The only world I really would like to live in, is a world much the same as
543 the one reflected in these books.
544 
545 In particular, a twon like Sanctuary; like Solmania; like QKrynn.  Towns built
546 in an almost-real idea, where men speak with steel and magic rules the day.
547 Where gods are gods and evil always a battle.
548 
549 And then, I think, 'Why is this?  This is not reachable, this is not reality.
550 Why strive and wring your hands and wonder when you know as sure as anything
551 you have ever known that this will never, can never be.'
552 
553 But then I consider what I once thaough I knew.  What I once thought was real.
554 Is this, after that reflection, so much fantasy?
555 
556                                                              PEN NAME

614 Darbon: Did you get the disks that I left for you at the desk?
615 I told Phillip (Drake???) that you would be stopping
616 by later to get them.  There is some neat stuff on them, but I will
617 tell you more later after I am sure you have them.
618 As for me, well yes I did see the new system, but it looks way too
619 expensive for me right now.   Maybe when I get that check from
620  you know where.  Anyway, I just wanted to say hi and let you
621 know that I do drop in over here every now and then.
622 I have noticed a lot less problems on here lately,
623 Maybe they got the problems ironed (or pounded!!) out.
624 Oh well, I might even try uploading some of that poetry I was working on when we last talked.
625 I try you know!!!
626 I am looking forward to your comments when you get the disks.
627 If Phillip doesn't find them...I'll shoot him!
