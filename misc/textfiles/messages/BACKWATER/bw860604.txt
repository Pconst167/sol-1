20 Notice: I'm looking for a job. Since I'm no longer with USD, I need
21 income to pay the bills. So if you know of any openings for someone
22 with extensive hardware/software interface experience, I'd appreciate
23 hearing about it. (This is for real folks, I really am looking.)

26 Times change, and the current problems in the PC field has had 
27 major impact on USD's sales, to the point that it could no longer 
28 support me, as such I gave what was left to my partner in exchange
29 he took over the liabilities (those that could be assigned). Which
30 leaves me looking for a job since basicly I'm broke. That's the
31 chance you take when you go into business for yourself, sometimes
32 it doesn't work out (more often then not actually).

34 I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT I'M SORRY to hear about your business biting
35 it.  My parents had a business that bit it and they had a hard time of it,
36 so I know how you must feel.  I'm sure you put a lot of your life into that
37 business and now that you don't have it anymore, it probably hurts.  All
38 I can say is good luck and remember that there's always next time (just over
39 that rainbow)....

54 News travels fast in Las Vegas. When the news concerns bodies, guns, or other
55 underworldly things, it moves even faster. Fellows and Parity were in trouble.
56 
57     "Now move back!" Fellows waved his weapon menacingly at the spectators.
58 "This is nothing that concerns you!" Some people moved back, but others
59 clung to a perimeter. They wanted to know what was going on with the body.
60     "Show 'em." growled Parity, looking up from checking the body. Fellows
61 acknowledged the order, took aim, and with a thundering explosion, one of
62 the garish silver palm trees that adore McCarran Airport became a smoldering
63 pile of nickel plated metal.
64 
65     The crowd ran for cover, as did the unarmed airport security guards who
66 had been slowly approaching the commotion. This gave Parity and Fellows a
67 chance at getting an unobtrusive look at the body. It took both men to turn
68 the body over and pull it off the luggage dispenser. The effort was
69 complicated by the still-revolving dispenser, and the sheer weight of the
70 body.
71 
72     "Hell, it looks like Ian." Fellows muttered, finally getting a look at
73 the face. The cheeks were puffy and white. Signs of rigormortis were starting
74 to set in.
75     "Yes, it does." Parity responded in the same muttered speech. "Check all
76 the pockets while I check the rest of this luggage. Something here might have
77 been Ian's."
78     "Ok." Fellows quickly found a wallet, a small notepad, a film canister,
79 and in the removable shoe heel, a locker key. The small hand-held computer
80 that Ian never seemed to be without was not found. "Parity!" Fellows yelled
81 to the other agent. "I found some odds and ends. How about you?"
82     "Just this." Parity said, setting down a circular case about seven inches
83 in diameter and twelve inches long. "A CD/ROM carrying case."
84     "Anything in it?"
85     "I don't know. It's locked, and it's also NET issue, which means the lock
86 best not be forced."
87     "I know what you mean. What are we going to do with the..."
88     Fellows was cut off by a wailing in the distance. Sirens. Las Vegas blue
89 moving in fast.
90     "We gotta move, and fast." Parity continued. "We'll have to leave the
91 body. Sure there isn't anything you missed?"
92     "As sure as I can be... Parity, I can't believe it's Ian."
93     "Neither can I. Let's get this stuff and get going."
94     "Where Parity? Where do we go?"
95     "Westward Ho Motel and Casino. It's big. We'll blend in for awhile. We 
96 have to check the stuff we found out, and contact HQ with the news."
97     "COMSET's right here." Fellows patted his small backpack, one not unlike
98 those used by college kids all over the country.
99 
100     The sirens were getting louder now, and the voices of security guards,
101 this time in greater numbers, could be heard in the luggage area. But there
102 was no one to greet the police as they arrived and stormed the area with
103 the now-armed airport personnel. The one person who remained was in no
104 condition to greet anybody, ever.

211 Silvermere Gossip 3
212     Hello again mighty and brave adventurers!  This is the Silvermere news crew
213 reporting with another hot story on the times of the great city Silvermere.
214     The city has had a sudden influx of adventurers lately, and the city council is in an uproar because they are having 
215 to pay heavy damages to repair damages.  After the mansion of Resuvius was looted, the council thought their troubles were
216 over, but then the Thieve's guild was attacked by a mysterious person who tried to take advantage of The Master.  She tried
217 to kill him, but it turned out that he was much more powerful.  He decimated the guild and killed all the current residents.
218 The drowish Master barely escaped with her life.  Later, a Cavalier, supposedly of a goodly lot, raped the prominent bard
219 Laura Hoyez.  She got her revenge, and te Cavalier left her screaming in agony because she had cut off one of his bodily 
220 members!  It is rumored that he later used a ring of regeneration to grow it back.  At the same time, The Master made an 
221 attempt to strike a blow back at the person who had devastated her guild.  She hired 8 assassins and they attacked that 
222 night.  Somehow, the victim awoke in time to save his own life, but the life of his best friend and ally was forfeit.
223 In rage and anger, he broke his Staff of the Magi.  A huge explosion, decimating 3 square blocks, ensued and the Gre
224 Griffon Inn saw it's last customer.  
225     The council was shocked by this and immediately sages and Magic-Users were hired to find out the perpetrator of the 
226 dastardly deed.  Even the fabled Magic User on the Hill was called in, but nothing of the identity except the name could 
227 be found.  The crater is currently nicknamed "The Veritas crater" in mockery of the person.  
228      As if that wasn't enough, sometime in the next few days, a barbarian wandered into the city and immediately got the
229 macho impression that he could take on the city.  The first thing he did was to kill the proprietor of the Magic, a member
230 of the city council.  The infamous Atuviel Araneth and Falin were hired to do the job of "taking care of the invader."
231 They set about it with relish, tracking him throughout the city.  They finally found him lingering in the assassin's guild
232 and attacked him as he came out.  Falin, hiding on a rooftop across the street shot his bow at the barbarian, wounding him
233 twice.  The barbarian, also known as Valkar, showed that he was somewhat intelligent though, and ran into the building of 
234 his assailant.  However, Falin and Atuviel were one step ahead of him.  As Valkar went up the steps, ATuviel appeared at th 
235 top and hit him full on with a devastating fireball!  In pain, Valkar ran up to her and swung his mighty sword.  Atuviel
236 Smiled as it bounced off her magical field protections.  She knew she was outforced here and so she ran up to Falin and 
237 flew away to the inner city to gather their forces.  Valkar, again being quick on the uptake, follewed them as best he
238 could on foot and tracked them to their house.
239     A terrific fight ensued, but finally Valkar was defeated as Atuviel cast a powerful disintegrate on him.
240     That short mission was enough to raise them both in the hierarchy of their professions and so they went into training
241 for a month or two.  During this time, they started to think about building a keep of their own.  Atuviel wanted on
242 the city, but Falin, being a Druid, wanted it in the wilderness.  In the end, they decided they would each make their
243 own keep, but would have teleporting gates between them.  Falin hired a small force of adventurers to clear out the 
244 land around the great cliffs for his stronghold.  They are presumably still on that mission after two weeks, but nothing 
245 has been heard from them.
246      Meanwhile, Atuviel and Falin continued their training.  Perhaps it was the gods who decided to interrupt them, and 
247 then again, maybe not.  No one knows how it happened, but suddenly, as the pair were in close mental and physical union,
248 they were transported through the planes of reality into another dimension.  The found themselves in a room with a not
249 on the ground.
250          "To go home, get to the bottom."
251     They got the hint and started their long journey into the depths of the place known only as: The House that Death Built.
252 Many strange and dangerous perils awaited them, including rooms for each of the main elements, an altar room for the
253 ?dead? gods of Melnibone, and the altar of Satan himself!  Falin, being a religious man, desecrated both rooms.  Arioch,
254 sent an Aleax after him, but Satan is said to have been too busy at the time.  However, it is generally known that Satan
255 will bear Falin an everlasting emnity.
256     These last adventures of the two, so well known within our great nation Silvenari, is known only because, as they left,
257 a large crystal ball was placed outside of the city gates depicting their current adventures.  Through thick and thin, and
258 not a few private moments, the city has cheered for renowned couple.  The two can expect quite a heroes welcome if they ever
259 make it back to Silvermere alive.
260      As a last minor news item, a thief was caught trying to rob a resident of the city.  This in itself is nothing unusual,
261 but this theif happened to be a Drow, the first one sighted in years.  The thief is currently being held in the Dunjon
262 While the mayor debates what to do with him.

267 in a message here, on Rain Forest, Silvermere BBS (one of my players liked the campaign THAT much!), or Blue Parrot.

285 Mikey: Two questions.
286 1. Do I want an 8251 or an 8251A?
287 2. Considering the price difference between 2708's and 2716's I'm considering
288 taking some 24 pin sockets and making "adapters" so I can use 16s....
289 (oops make that 3 questions)
290 I note that most of the parts (2708's & 2114's) are rated at 450ns. Is this
291 adequate?
292 ____06/06/86__________Leonard_JD 2446588.6699_________20:04:39_____________
293 Leonard: an 8251 or 8251A will work fine. Suggest that you use the A if yo 
294 you have it though, as it is a better part. (the non-A has some bugs,
295 though the software works around it. BW uses non-A, but that's because I
296 had some and threw it in (save my A's for something useful).
297 As for using 2716's, no problem, why not just cut the traces to the +12
298 and -5 and run them to the apropriate lines. And you might want to consider
299 taking it one step further and rewiring the selects to have the proper
300 addresses. But baring that, I do have lots of 2708's that are going to waste
301 thatI'll sell you real cheap if yu want to go that route.
302 And finally, yes, 450ns is fine, the board wil run with 600ns parts actually.

402 Hmmmm.. another strange batch of code.  Since it's not a NET code, or an
403 UNDERGROUND code, maybe our friendly neighorhood twit has decided to do somethin
404 more imaginative (well, *anything* would be more imaginative...), or maybe it's
405 an invite to another of those theoretical Risk games.  Come to think of it,
406 it resembles L2, and Alex always did have a problem with that code, plus both
407 times now one of Leonard's boarders have been (re)uploaded ofter the code.

414 Greetings to all,
415   The Bit Bucket BBS, after undergoing a lot of changes in the past
416 few months due to new hardware, is back!  Right now, it's undergoing
417 beta testing on the new computer system, a National 16032-based system
418 running a Unix 4.2BSD lookalike.  Up until now, the system has been
419 running a public domain BBS package called UNaXcess, which turned a lot
420 of people off because it was rather klutzy.  Now users can use the
421 beta-test version of the new Bit Bucket by following a slightly different
422 login sequence when you connect with the machine.  To get into the new
423 Bucket, call 254-xxxx 300/1200 baud anytime, and once connected press
424 RETURN once.  You should receive a banner message, followed by a login:
425 prompt.  If you don't get this, press RETURN again slowly until the system
426 responds.  Once you get the login: prompt, enter 'bucket' (ALL LOWER CASE,
427 NO QUOTES) and press RETURN.  The system will then prompt for a password.
428 At the Password: prompt type 'betatest' (ALL LOWER CASE, NO QUOTES).  The
429 password will not echo.  Press RETURN after entering the password. After
430 you enter the correct password, there will be a slight delay, then the
431 new Bit Bucket will start up.  No USER-ID's are active, so you'll have
432 to apply for access, but I'm validating users within 12 hours, so you
433 won't have to wait long to try out the system.  Right now the software
434 is still a LONG ways from being finished, so there are a lot of things
435 that aren't working yet, but the basic functionality of a BBS is there.
436 Make sure that you read messages 1 and 2 on the new system, they explain
437 a lot about the differences.
438 So, give it a try and let me know what you think.  Leave messages
439 on Bit Bucket, Bucket/UNaXcess(if you have access there already), via
440 Unix Mail to bucket!rickb, or on CBBS/NW to RICK BENSENE.
441 Hope to see many of you old-time Bucket users there (as well as some
442 new people too!)

477 Now that one was so absurd that I had to share it with the rest of you.
478 I wonder what universe this guy is from. He certainly needs to learn
479 how to spell. And as for his curse/judgement (he seems to be awfully
480 confused here) it doesn't seem to be very effective. Of course if Mars 
481 ever *did* cross the orbit of the moon I suspect that things wouldn't
482 be all that great anyway. But luckily Mars is safely tucked away in
483 it's gravitationally locked orbit which doesn't even remotely come
484 close to the moon (well, at least on a local scale). 
485 And if we go by the basic rules and structure of a curse, it is not only
486 ineffective, but dangerous for the one involking it. It is so riddled
487 with errors in spelling, content and structure that even if it were 
488 effective it would end up folding back on the one who uttered it.

493 
494 meone once told me that BWMS is the toilet bowl of bulltetin
495   board systems.  I think I am beginning to understand why.  It's one
496   main fault is the encouragement of anonymity.  For all the twits who
497   may not understand what anonymity is, let me explain.  This system
498  allows anyone to call in and use it - be he a communist pinko or
499  satan worshiper.  This is why said types use it, since they find it
500   difficult to fit in on regular systems.  You see, regular people
501   would quickly delete these twits (Note: in some circles this is
502   called 'twitting').  However, BWMS has no provision for determining
503   the good users from the bad.  Consequently, Backwater serves as a
504   gathering place for the sewage of humanity.
505       Obviously, I agree with my friend's analogy of a toilet bowl. 
506   I would like to expand on this though.  You see... (again) that this
507   system only gets flushed every 629 lines.  During average call-in
508   rates that's about three days.  Now imagine, if you will, a toilet
509   bowl that is used maybe (conservatively speaking) ten times a day
510   for three days straight.  As you can see... a lot of uh.. sewage
511   piles up.  Now you may begin to understand why regular people don't
512   frequent this system.  Not many regular people I know will use a
513   toilet bowl after being used thirty times without being flushed.
514        Maybe BWMS is more appropriately called OHMS, OutHouse Message
515  System.  It's the only toilet I know of that is flushed about as
516   often as this board.  Actually though I think its present name
517   reflects its true nature; sewage is about as Backwater as you can
518   get.
519        Getting back to my earlier meanderings, I think that anonymity
520   breeds irresponsibility and immaturity (Twit translation:
521   irresponsibility - Since no one knows who you are, you don't have to
522   be careful about what you say.  immaturity - act like yourself). 
523  Anyone can call up and leave insulting messages without having to
524   take responsibility for them.  Also, we have the freedom to use
525   aliases.
526       From experience, I've found that most patrons (Twits: you're on
527   your own for this one) have at least two aliases.  One is their good
528   alias and one is their bad alias.  Use the good one for writing
529   stories, praising authors, leaving serious messages,      etc... and
530   use the bad one for leaving dirty messages and other things you
531   wouldn't want people to think your good alias would do.  It is often
532   said that the users make the system, and in this instance I think
533   the evidence is irrefutable.
534        In closing I would just like to say I hope you enjoy your stay
535   at the outhouse of bulletin boards.
536   
537  This public service message was brought to you by
538                       Beatrice (We're everywhere you look)
539 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
540 
541  The toilet boil of BBSs eh? Well, I would have to disagree with that.
542 What's not stated is that the excessive abusive messages *are* removed
543 rather quickly. Yes BWMS does not conform to the strict straight jacket
544 approach of the 'proper' BBS structure, but then it wouldn't be what it
545 is. BW has always been on the forefront of writting activity because of
546 it's openness. Instead of locking out the new and curious user, they can
547 jump in and test the waters. Make a mistake? No problem, no one is going 
548 to think less of you or call you an ass or forever stop you from calling
549 again. BW offers what the other systems cannot--- freedom.
550 But freedom does not come cheap. Their are those who are envious of it,
551 those who would force the submission of it, those who would try to control
552 it. They are envious because they cannot be that way, through their own
553 lack of willingness to standup and be counted as a creative force. Since
554 they cannot be creative they tear at and attack BW. If they can't be that
555 way, no one can. 
556  So "normal" people don't use BW eh? What is normal? In walking through 
557 the other systems I have yet to see anyone that could be attributed to
558 the social 'norm'. Just to have interest in this form of communication
559 requires some degree of abnormal behavior by social standards.
560  Yes BW does not require proper names, but then most systems don't really
561 either. Oh, yes you have to log on with what seems like a reasonable name,
562 but it is seldom checked. In most cases they just pass it on through. BW at
563 least doesn't have any pretense in this. And that about says it, that is
564 what makes BW different, it is unpretentious.
565  No, BW is not the toilet bowl of BBS systems or other derogatory and 
566 pointless degrading references. It is the one truely free and creative
567 BBS left in the Portland area. And as long as its users and the good
568 Cistop continue to support and encourage its use, it will survive. Envy 
569 or not by those that would demand that it "conform", it will continue
570 to exist, because that is what BW is, freedom in its very basic essence.

574 I agree to some extent with Remur, but onthing
575 that was not pointed out was the multiple identiy
576 thing that was brought up.  I too have several IDs,
577 but I don't use them to go after other entries.
578 If I don't like something I say so, I don't hide
579 behind a name to do so, most of the people I know
580 here also have mutliple names as you say, but I 
581 don't know of any of them who use them to go
582 after someone they take a dislike to. Certainly
583 not with fould or abusive language. That is 
584 largely your own immagination.

591 ^^^^^     Things are sure in sad shape...  So much room is left behind
592 ^^^^^     and there is so much cleaning up to do...  Yet with no help?  >G
593 Ah yes, the old toilet bowl name-calling trick. Why are people so damned
594 insecure they fell they MUST lash out like that? It is a real shame that
595 someone intellegent enough to use a computer and modem is so uncreative
596 as to leave such a message. Fortunately it is one person's opinion, nothing
597 more.

600 I see that for lack of more constructive thing to bitch about some of our illustrious
601 users have taken to insulting the system and its users.  Why don't you stick to theology
602 or twit hunting or at least something productive.

607 IT SEEMS AS IF THE AUTHOR OF THE OUTHOUSE MESSAGE HAS SURE STRUCK A NERVE!!
608 I THINK THE SINGLE DIGIT IQ USERS WERE INSULTED WITH THE TRUTH!!
609 THE PERSON WHO WROTE THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN A AWARD FOR BEING ABLE TO
610 PUT THE TRUTH IN A FORM THAT INSULTS THE LOW LIFES OF THE MODEM WORLD.
611 IN OTHER WORDS THE REAL TWITS ARE THE MAIN USERS.  IN FACT I'LL BET
612 THAT IF THERE WAS SOME WAY TO FIND OUT WHO ALL THE "TWITS" ARE ONE WOULD
613 FIND THAT THEY ARE THE REGULAR USERS OF THIS LOW LIFE GATHERING SYSTEM.
614 YOU KNOW, THE ONES WHO PLAY BIG SHOT BUT ALSO CALL IN AND RAISE HELL WITH 
615 THE NORMAL TRASH OF HUMANITY THAT USES THIS PILE OF GARBAGE.

623 Twits?  Twits, eh?  Let's see now.  From the Old English word `aetwitan' that
624 means to put blame upon.
625 Sounds to me as if the OHMS entry is the very definition of twitliness.

628 I WONDER WHY IT WAS PLACED ON THIS BULLETIN BOARD. IT IS RUDE, AND IF THIS
629 SUCH A HORRID PLACE, IT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ENTERED.
