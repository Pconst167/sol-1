26 I just read an article in The Newscientist which says that
27 I'm a parisite on the female of the sex. Woe is me...
28 Is it not enough that I am continually bandied with the
29 concept of me being nothing more then a figurehead without
30 having to hear my sex being called a parisite as well?
31 To be more specific, it is calling me a Geonomic disease 
32 sort of like a virus. It's bad enough being called a disease
33 but to be put in the same catagory as the common cold! That 
34 is a low blow! 
35 As they put it;
36    Primitive sexuality is a contagious disease. Bacteria 
37 normally reproduce asexually, by splitting in two. But when
38 Escherichia coli becomes infected with a segment of 
39 parisitic DNA - a plasmoid known as the F factor - the bug
40 begins to mate (Oh great now they are calling me a bug as
41 well - tisk tisk) It grows sex pili and uses them to inject
42 the F factor and bits of its own DNA into other bacteria.
43 Parisitic DNA may have invented sexual reproduction simply 
44 in order to spread itself around between lineages.

46 Sorry, Mike, we all gotta come from somewhere, but lay off that parasite
47 bit; it still takes 2 to make babies. Of course, one man and a lot of 
48 women (or should that be ladies?)....
49 For all you forth freeks: in the latest Creative there is a review of the
50 Jupiter Ace, the first(I do beleive) computer that comes with forth in 
51 ROM, so it starts up in forth, not basic. The price is only $150. It is
52 sort of like an improved Sinclair.
53 However, for rather less money you can buy a VIC-20, and the VICFORTH
54 cartridge, get FORTH, more memory, a far better keyboard, color graphics,
55 and when you want to write a program, can unplug forth, and run BASIC.
56 We'll have to wait and see what it actually sells for, the VIC is still
57 being advertised as "less than $299", but last I saw it was nearer $85.
58 When will we have a small Pascal in ROM?
59 
60 Oh, by the way Mike, why did you switch discs so soon, there is still
61 good room on DB?

107 To the person who wanted the BBS numbers on the the other
108 disk....the # to call to find a very complete BBS listing
109 is (206) 693-xxxx. That is the vancouver BBS and he has
110 a very good listing of all the BBS's around the Oregon
111 and Washington area. (and beyond) Anyway..if you have
112 not called there before, when the system asks you for a 
113 users ID type "NEWUSER" and for a password type "FIRSTIME".
114 (without quotes) When you get to a system ready prompt type
115 "BBLIST" and thats all there is to it.
116 Be patient. His system operates a little slower than the
117 others but he has a very complete setup and is worth
118 checking out. Bye.

123 
124     Yes, that's what I meant. I meant to say that the keyboard
125 driver routine is intercepted at the KEYBOARD DCB, and same is
126 true with the Video. Okay, now the sticky stuff. Where does he
127 want it located?  Below BASIC storage area?  Protected in high
128 memory? Where? Also, what does he want,  say character codes 9
129 and 127 to do?   Does he want special characters to do special
130 things like 7 will produce a bell out the cassette port?  Tell
131 me EXACTLY what he wants and I'll write it just for him.   You
132 don't need to tell me EVERY code and what it does,  but simply
133 what ones are different from the ones ordinarrily displayed by
134 the TRS-80.

142 TO: Berney   Fm: CISTOP Mikey
143 The real reason I changed the disk was that I was getting 
144 Intensively bored with the goings on of late and was hopeing to
145 inject some new blood with a fresh disk. This was also my reason
146 for implanting the above article refferance in the hopes that I
147 would get a response of some sort out of it. I must say that
148 I am surprized at the ho-hum response so far. As strongly as it
149 was worded I had expected to get a much stronger reaction.
150 Hmmm, Maybe it was too strong? I do have to say that the extrapolations
151 of the ideas were mine, I was simply taking things to their logical
152 conclusion based on the presented thought pattern. The last
153 paragraph however is almost verbatim from the article with the
154 exception of my comment in (). P.S. don't take my comments or
155 ramblings too seriously, I generally inject them just to see what 
156 kind of response I'll get!

161 coordinate in DE and the second x,y coordinate in HL. You call
162 a routine and it would draw the line. Could anyone do this or

183 To Pann,  Fm Adam Trent, 
184 Hi, Thanks for mentioning the meeting.  Last time I tried to go to
185 the meeting (at the Aloha Computer&Things) the building was vacant.
186 Did they move or go out of business??  I'll try to make the one at Tek.
187 I like STOIC over FORTH because, as a high-level language, it offers
188 a more symetric model for handling strings and string literals.  It
189 has a compile buffer which allows for more flexibility in "immediate"
190 testing of routines.  Haven't used CODE word defining in STOIC (ie, I
191 haven't dropped into the STOIC assembler).  It has one though.  Speed
192 is definitely comparable to FIG-FORTH if you assemble STOIC with-out
193 stack boundary checking (I like stack boundary checking, tho).
194 STOIC is 75% 8080 ASM and 25% in itself.  FORTH is usually 75% in
195 itself and 25% in ASM.  This generally leads to pretty good 
196 performance for STOIC as compared to FORTH.  The STOIC vocabulary
197 stack is a more rational mechanism than the static vocabulary
198 tree of FORTH.  The FORTH disk access model is more primitive and
199 thus more flexible than the CP/M file access provided with stock
200 STOIC.  HOWEVER, line numbers (ala BASIC) and screen numbers
201 (ala FORTH) are absolute references and are DUMB in my opinion.

252 to use the above. you must convert all colons : to your newline function, usually
253 a carriage return, line feed or both.
254 it is about 100-120 characters per line, to fit on here; the 50 or so
255 lines becomes about 250 when expanded:: it won't work unless expanded.
256 I don't promise anything; the @ especially is death to Microsoft, at
257 least in my version,& becomes a newline without ending a logical line.
258 It simply disappears. Heath basic works OK.

383 Hey, little lizard, is your tongue sharp enough to do battle with
384 _________Max Grody____?????????????????????????????????????????
385 Apprentice, if you try "thou wilst", you are in the ballpark, I seem to
386 remember that was common a few years back, somewhere, somewhen, 
387 or thereabouts.
388 In the new Newsweek there is an article on supercomputers, and the "race
389 with Japan, Inc. to produce one. It seems there is some fear that the 
390 about $1 billion planned to be spent in the US isn't enough to offset
391 the $200 million that Japan is about to spend. They took over the 
392 pocket calculator market, the elecrtonic watch market, and now 
393 supercomputers? They haven't even made a dent in the microcomputer market
394 yet. (Except for printers) And this is because they haven't been able to
395 get into the software. Yet. We won't say anything about the fact that
396 the US firms that are trying to beat out Japan are afraid of being sued
397 for doing the very thing that Japan is doing. (Neither IBM nor AT&T 
398 would join, because of the legal problems.) Right we (US) own the market,
399 all 76 machines of it. I believe the person who wrote the article was 
400 severely overstating the importance of this huge market; the very fact
401 that IBM is not counted among the makers of supercomputers says a little
402 about their view of the value of such, or the market possibilites of the
403 things. (To a company that sells about half the big computers in the world,
404 and about 1/5 the small ones, (( a million or so)) the possibility of
405 selling another dozen isn't worth the cost.) Will a few billion bucks
406 really be enough? After all, most of the present super c's are made by
407 Cray, and designed by one person (Cray himself), who also laid the basis
408 for much of the competion's (CDC's).
409 The interesting thing is the comments on what is "just around the corner"
410 in the field of artificial intelligence: computers who talk, and can be
411 talked to, or ones that seem truly "intelligent" (ie, in an open discussion,
412 can seem aware of what is happening, and react or answer in a sensible
413 manner). Why is this so especially noteworthy? Because I have a book 
414 written in the mid 1950's ( 30 years ago) that said that the same things
415 were JUST AROUND THE CORNER! Machine translation from one language to 
416 another seemed closer then than it does today, because it has been tried,
417 and fell on it's butt. Truly, we are a lot closer to artificial 
418 intelligence today (by about 30 years) but God alone knows how long more
419 we must wait. My guess is that when such a machine is built, we won't know
420 it, because it will take abut 20 years to program it. In other words,
421 about as long as it takes to program it's competion, the human brain.
422 If something that operates about a million times slower is a more powerful
423 computer, just maybe they are looking in the wrong direction?? How 
424 about parallel processing? Use 10 million neurons to replace one IC,
425 try holographic encodeing in 100 million for a memory, with majority
426 logic for error correction, feed it sugar and ATP, in water, call it
427 a brain, house it in a self replicating, self repairing, self programming
428 body, and call it a person. It isn't obsolete yet.
429 //////////////////////////////////B.A.D.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
430 -----
431 Once the program for the "intelligent" computer was finished, however, you
432 could have it build more "intelligent" computers or just copy its program
433 to another computer.
434 -----
435 So, you say, the supercomputer can outdo its human rival: real, live cloning
436 !  Or will that take 9 months, too.  'Course, it now takes a human babe 
437 'bout 20 years to gain a bit of judgment, right?

439 Apprentice:  Learn these things:  Honor thy teachers, but be ye wary lest ye
440 grasp the wrong lessons.  'Tis ill-formed to speak with the contractive
441 tongue;  'tis worse to pen it.  Refrain ye from words like "conjugate", lest
442 ye raise yon hairy crop upon the backs of your fingers.       Ol' Master
443 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
444 The problem with computer translation of languages isn't the
445 computer's fault. If you want proof, consider the following:
446 Ask someone what "yeah" means. They will probably say something
447 like "it means yes, or indicates agreement". To this you respond
448 "Oh yeah?"
449 Try running that thru a computer! My point is that the REAL
450 problem is that while you can tell a computer how to do ANYTHING
451 we usually get upset when it does what it was told to. We really
452 DON'T know what the rules for various human languages are and
453 we certainly have no idea what "intelligence" IS. When we figure
454 out what it is, we will probably find that we COULD have done it
455 with present day machines.

524 probably be back around the same time so I won't call from home.
525 Got a bunch of new games from Steve... there is a set of term-
526 inating resistors in my interface that make the computer think
527 the joystick is pushed every way at once (they pull the data
528 lines to ground) so I've had to go through most of the games
529 and zap the joystick routines.  It's easy though; just search
530 the disk file for a DB 00 (IN A,(0)) and change it to a
531 3E FF (LD A,0FFH).  Once you get started it's almost automatic.
532 Hey, I should build a DO file to do all the busywork for me...

537 TO: ADAM TRENT        FM: MIKE DAY       RE: AMODEM
538 
539 I have found a bug which may have been giving you problems,
540 in the routine that waits for the SOH from the sender,
541 change the following:
542 
543 RCVSOHE PUSH B
544         MVI B,1
545         CALL RECV
546         POP B
547         JNC RCVSOHE
548 
549         LDA RSENDBF
550         CALL SEND
551 
552 To look like this:
553 
554 RCVSOHE LDA RSENDBF
555         CALL SEND
556 
557 This eliminates the garbage collection at this point which
558 was gobbling up the SOH so that the receiver never saw it.
559 It has a side benifit of boosting local high speed transfers
560 by at least 4 to 1! The disavantage is that if the sender
561 times out and resends the sector again you will get a buch
562 of garbage but it seems to recover nicely anyway.
563 The above routine occurs in the AMODEMR.ASM file.

574 " My darlin' Lil,
575 You just got to get me out of this jail tonight.  Bring my horse and
576 tie his reins to the back window;  have him pull them bars right off.
577 But don't make a sound 'til then.
578 Trouble is, I don't know which cell I'm in!  But here's what I do know
579 about the layout of the jail:
580 There's six cells back here, all in a row, and each one has a high window
581 facin' the back alley.  I'm in a cell next to a feller name of Buck.  He's 
582 on my right as I stand facin' the door of my cell.  Don't know if there's
583 anybody in the cell on my other side--that cell's either empty or the 
584 feller in there's real quiet-like.
585 Buck's a regular here.  He's been fussin' on account of he didn't get his
586 usual corner cell, which is empty right now.  He says there's two other
587 fellers in here with us: Jake and Bart.
588 I hear tell this Jake is a real famous desperado.  They got him off by 
589 himself--nobody next to him.  Haven't heard a peep from him the whole time.
590 That other feller, Bart, is a real noisy one, always singin' cowboy
591 songs.
592 They just come to take Jake off to Abilene to stand trial. I leaned my
593 head against the bars and looked down the hall to my right, and caught a
594 glimpse of him.  Real mean-lookin'.
595 Please come and get me tonight.           Love, Dan"

619 Anyone for nasty comments? This is the typical 
620 'puzzle freaks delight', but is unfortunately full of holes: there are
621 several possible answers, as not enough data is given, but a lot is
622 assumed. The cells are in a line, but is the line straight? not said.
623 Did you ASSUME that the corner cell that Buck isn't in means he isn't
624 in a corner cell? There may be 2 corners. Or more cells around the corner.
625 But let's not quibble, the story line won't cut anyway, no horse can
626 pull out jail bars with his reins.
627 .... well, got back on. Did Ma Bell pull a sneaky?
