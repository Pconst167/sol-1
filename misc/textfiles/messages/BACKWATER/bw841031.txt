25 As our heroine moved towards the inner circle she could feel
26 the light touch of a small leathery creature near her calf.
27 "Oh Ontho!" She cried, "You have returned!" the creature looked
28 up at her recognizing the 8 images it saw as its companion.
29 Ontho wrapped a loving tentacle around Leo's right leg and crawled
30 up her to find a resting spot on her head. Ontho enjoyed theee 
31 vantage view and the excellent launch spot in times of danger.
32 **************************kathy********************************************
33 	So we go toghether... her heart beating at the thought of possessing
34 the sacred trident.
35 
36 	Ontho buzzed. "zappa kow kow na!"
37 	Leo smirked " I know I waited a long time, I thought you had been
38 eaten by a desperate harpie.
39 	She had reached thee chest, Ontho gracefully jumped off Leo's head
40  nd landed on the chest. ZZAAAPPPP!!!!!  pop hissss, and jumped off in a
41  icro's screaching in pain. "zzbahhh!" Ontho's third tenicle looked a little
42  ooked.
43  "Gee thanks for the warning kid", She picked up Ontho and set it 
44  never talk sex with an alien) on her hip. Ontho secured itself to her so
45  he could have both hands free.
46  Ontho wasn't sure why the human was such good company, she was so
47  imited in her flightless clumsy body. And then after speculated figured
48  t must be her mind. She was quite bright and they made a good team.
49 Ontho became aware her desired to scratch, the third tenicle had dropped
50 off and a new one was forming. No better not ontho thought, that would be
51 rather rude.
52 	Leo had been looking thru her pouch and found the dull blue orb
53 that had been the object of her search.
54 	"this should do the trick" She stepped back about 4 paces and 
55 slipped the blast shield down around her eyes. With a quick snap of her
56 wrist the orb impacted the chest.j A blue flash lasted about 4 micro's
57 and was gone.
58 	To test the effectivness Leo asked Ontho's permission and when
59 granted dropped the discarded tenicle on the chest. the tenicle just
60 lay there, no more toasting of the tenicles was apperant.
61 	Ontho looked up and saw the relief and curiousity on the face of
62 Leo, who couldn't wait a `nother micro and flung the chest open.

65 Mikey: I'll have the disk there, along with $12 more. I can (try) to collect
66 from my counterparts another time. I have bad news about the other 8" disks.
67 They have been recalled. For some unknown as yet reason, the files I copied
68 from the LNW unto supposed Kaypro disks and then tried to read back on
69 the Kaypro give me BDOS errors. I can't get directories, and my Kaypro copy
70 program (to put the files on MSDOS) can't read the disks. It means another

109 /MiG/ --- Have you tried high pass & low pass active filters (maybe two stages
110      of each) ((& a high Q notch filter if you need more rolloff slope))? One
111      of the many quad OpAmp packs should do it. I'm including fundamental OpAmp
112      configurations for the active filters. You are 80 characters wide? Yes?
113      Most Integrated Ckt. companies have application handbooks on this.

169 The Poet saw no one in the strange, watery world in which he found himself. He had nothing to eat, but plenty to 
170 drink. Oh, well, he thought, perhaps I can find someone with something to eat. A roast yak would be nice...and maybe
171 some apricot brandy... and I guess I can't get any wetter...  He turned to where the pools seemed shallowest, and 
172 began sloshing his way toward the horizon.

193 "No not really,just got here." Allanon replied.

229 I watched tiredly as the man skimmed off into the distance.  He did that with such little effort.  "I wonder if that is
230 his power, or if it is common to those who are here?  Can we skim like that?", I asked.
231 "Can't hurt to try.  I'm tired of swimming, besides.", the Friar commented.  We all felt tired.  We became still, and
232 concentrated.
233 The water lapped gently at our sides.  A warm feeling swept down me, as if a message had been sent and received.  I 
234 opened my eyes.  The others were hovering about two feet from the water, held there by some bluish force arising from
235 the water.  I was still immersed.  Those near me were having problems maintaining their blue support, but were holding
236 it.  The others were making small exploratory runs with their new-found toys.  "Anti-magic dampening field... that is
237 what has happened!  Someone, come closer.", I said.  Bard steered near me, and promptly fell into the water.  "Thank
238 you, my friend.  I needed to know that.  But do I walk?", I said.  I was caught in despair.  I would slow the others
239 because they could not leave me behind.  I tried it again.  The water refused me once more.  My fustration grew to 
240 anger, and my ring awoke again.  With a violent wash of argent, I was hurtled up ten feet above the water, the water 
241 below boiling from the raw force the ring had and still was expending.  A gasp of surprise escaped my lips.  Emotions...
242 a lot of doors are opened this day.  A yell from behind me made me spin around.  The Piper had gone quite a distance 
243 and had found The Mad Actor out there somewhere, taught him how to call upon the water, and was bringing him back.  We
244 exchanged a few greetings, talked a bit, and then sped off where the man had come, hoping to find out at least a little
245 more.  At least he had said something about civilization, something we had not seen for quite some time.
246 I thought again toward the time schedule of the Gates.  "Due to open again... oh, in another week, give or take a day."
247 We crossed vast areas of water, kicking up spray as we followed the man...

260 Leo had been so excited to open the chest, her force caused the
261 hinges to twist and break, Ontho leaned over to get a better 
262 look inside. "reazz tizz dozz" ( that means's hey! there is a
263 robe that would look great on me!) Leo agreed and pulled out a
264 slime green robe with 4 convenient spaces for tenicles to move
265 freely thru. When she removed Ontho's present she saw the object
266 that had been the object of her quest for the past year.
267 	"The trident!" She gasped as the glow it radiated as soon
268 as she picked it up, she felt herself changing and spinning out
269 of this time, but not out of control, she grew 2 inches now up to
270 the proud height of 5'10" tall and put on 10 lbs to accomidate the
271 extra height. Her clothing had changed from simple traving clothes
272 to garb of exceptional quality and strenth. She knew things could
273 never be the same. 
274 	Ontho was perplexed only for a moment, it took only a micro
275 of study to realize the trident Leo was holding was changing the
276 little inmo also.  The tenicles were growing longer and stronger,
277 although no other change in size occured, mental ablities were
278 tripled, Ontho was delighted, and realized the human was no longer
279 needed for decisions. However Ontho really did enjoy Leo and didn't
280 want to leave her after this.

288 kathy-- it's a relief to hear that you aren't the same person-- she asked me to help her study & then didn't pass--
289 quite embarassing. By the way, you're writing some of the best stuff I've seen here. You rank up there with Piper,
290 and perhaps (dare I say it?) might compete for grace & originality with the near-mythical PAM. (Now, PAM fans, 
291 don't get upset, but you've gotta admit her stuff's GOOD.) Welcome to the Backwater Inn.

293 The Poet maintained an air of intense detachment as he wrang the water from his robe. It was almost more than his
294 ego could take, having to be rescued like this. He was used to being a leader, a mover and shaker, and here he was
295 having to think of a graceful way to admit he wasn't able to get home on his own... He'd only wanted a quiet evening
296 of drinking at the Inn, not to go on some no doubt dangerous adventure. Yet how would it look when he admitted that
297 he got stuck here because he was reality-peeping at the party? The humiliation was more than one of his artistic
298 temprement should have to bear. He'd just have to stick quietly to the rear of the party and hope they'd take him
299 along when they went home. IF they went home...

306 Thank-you Mad Actor, for the compliment, I hope someone out there
307 will print my work, i don't have a compatible printer here at work
308 so this is original material. I have seen some really interesting 
309 stuff here on the bwms but I personally don't ge into hobbits and
310 dwarfs although I have heard they are quit compatible associates.
311 I am reading my roomates comic books when extremly board and have
312 some idea's from those. I especially enjoy "the new mutants    " and
313 "the x-men". My own personal reading habits usually extend only to
314 biographies of famous people, (long since dead). and heavy sci-fi.
315 strange combination i admit.  anyway thanks for the imput, if I
316 had received any negative comments it whould have been the end of
317 an extremmly short writing career. (aprox 30 hours)

320   Kathy -- welcome to the inn!  Your attempts are exceptionally good, most
321 emphatically so when you say that this is your first attempt.  Unfortunately,
322 you may recieve some criticism from the anti-fiction faction for working with
323 fiction at all, but that criticism has been sparse of late and should not affect
324 you at all.  (Perhaps I should say, please do not let it affect you at all.)
325   Milchar -- I'm getting pressed for time from work.... please keep the 
326 adventure going, and I'll try to catch up on reading it in time to participate.
327   I'll try, but it's getting very difficult right now (sigh....)
328 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
329 Kathy - after so much glowing praise, a little criticism from the cynical corner
330 is called for.  Have no fear, it's nothing major.  
331 Your spelling is a little shaky, most noticeably being "tenicle"
332 The actual spelling is "tentacle".  There have been other words, but they come
333 up less frequently.  Don't take this wrong-I enjoy your entries and hope you
334 continue.  It's just that some of us never say anything unless it's a complaint.
335 In any case, I hope to see more creative entries from you.  If you feel up 
336 to correcting your spelling and punctuation, great.  If not, I will still
337 read and enjoy your writing.  Whichever, welcome aboard.

356 Leonard:No, I will *NOT* design anything with an intel processor. But I will
357 volunteer my first machine, a 4MHZ Z-80 card with 2k of ram and 4 2716 EPROM 
358 slots on it. As I recall the Z-80 is 99.99% code compatible with that wr
359 wretched 8080 part, with block moves that make string handling much more 
360 easy. When you think about it, BW is mostly string handling. I will need
361 the 16K pack untill I get off my buns and rebuild my 64K card. Right now I 
362 am working on stuff for Al, which means money, I NEED money! If you can write
363 your assembly to 3740 8-inch disks I can blast some 2716's I hope you write
364 non-position dependant code! 
365 I have to go put together another PDP 11/04 at Lewis and Clark saturday, so

370 O.K, it's time once again for that fateful question: who's going to be at PORSFIS? I know the last few times I've
371 said I'd make it I didn't, but I'm REALLY, REALLY going to try this time.
372 By the way-- kathy, you're invited, too. The BW people get together at the PORSFIS meeting at the downtown library
373 every other saturday. Not all of us make it(ahem) but it has been attended by several of our notables. I forget the
374 time, but then again it's in character for me to arrive late; after all, the Poet has been lagging behind lately, too.
375 Milchar-- the ball's in your court. You started this one, so where do we go from here?

378 KATHY - YOUR WRITING HAS BEEN FAVORABLY COMPARED TO PAMS. THE TRUTH OF 
379 THE MATTER IS THAT YOU'RE A MUCH BETTER WRITER THAN SHE EVER WAS. THE 
380 SECRET TO PAMS POPULARITY WAS THAT SHE WROTE EROTIC FANTASIES THAT 
381 CAUSED SOME OF THE MORE FRUSTRATED INN MEMBERS TO GO BANNANAS. WHAT WE 
382 HAVE HERE IS SOMETHING OF A "LETS WORSHIP PAM" CULT. I WOULDN'T BE 
383 SURPRISED IF THE REASON PAM AVOIDS THE INN IS BECAUSE SHE GOT TIRED OF 
384 BEING WORSHIPED RATHER THAN BEING RESPECTED AS A PERSON. BEWARE THAT THE 
385 SAME FATE DOESN'T BEFALL YOU. THAT IS, OF COURSE, UNLESS YOU ENJOY 
386 BEING DROOLED OVER.          MAX

400 for a while.Then it came to him.He jump up out of the bed and
401 started  yelling "Hey,Guards,Quick i'm very ill!!".

438 Max: Maybe YOU didn't think PAM was good, but I did. Nor did she write
439 'erotic' fantasies. She once left a story with refference to witch-
440 craft which required being naked to perform, but it was only stated
441 in passing she didn't dwell on it. Her concern was for acuracy not
442 flash. The reason I enjoyed her writing was because she wasn't afraid
443 to put her own feelings and thoughts into it. This made it identifiable
444 and believable. This is the very same reason why I consider Piper's 
445 writing to be as good. This isn't to say any of it is/was perfect.
446 Given the medium, that is a near impossiblity. Besides why would anyone
447 want to spend weeks or months perfecting something that will only
448 last a couple of days or so? 
449 Yes, I do miss PAM's input, but I hardly worship it or her. I miss her as
450 I would miss any other good friend. I am sorry that you feel that PAM was
451 a poor writer, but I object to the insinuation that she was a trollop.
452 I suggest you check your own gonads before accusing others.

455 L'homme: Well, the Pascal version ran fine both on the IBM and on the Sanyo
456 (In fact, the color was only available on the Sanyo, as I don't have a 
457 cable built for the Z150 yet.) Wasn't able to get the basic versions going
458 they didn't like my basica, and my gwbasic is still on backorder. 
459 Prelim response is that it doesn't look to bad. Not fantastic, but then
460 that wasn't expected. Otherwise, still trying to decide what to do.
461 Will let you know.
462 
463 Kathy: I too agree that you have a good start. Needs a little work maybe,
464 but it is good.

492 	The two travelerss were still getting over the shock of their
493 metamorphosis when the heard a loud "GONG GOMG GONG" Ontho leaped from
494 Leo's side in anxiety, turning in midair to see what was going on. A
495 large vehicle was moving towards them. actually it was more like a disk
496 with several persons sitting comfortably in lawnchairs on it's surface.
497 Leo looked around, the surroundings had changed dramactically since their
498 contact with the trident. The chest was gone and they seemed to be standing
499 in a lightned void with mist spinning around their feet.  The disk moved
500 within 15 paces of them and stopped.  A old woman stood up and addressed
501 Leo, "my daughter, we have chosen you to be the carrier of the trident and 
502 the keeper of it's power". Leo thought to herself "Gee golly I thought I
503 had chosen myself old lady?" The old woman heard Leo's thoughts and
504 stated " You could not have even approached the  chest without our help,
505 also when you broke the chest in your greedy haste you disturbed the
506 power of the trident. It will not be as reliable to you, you will not
507 be able to depend on it 100% of the time." Leo looked down in shame,
508 Ontho had waddled closer to the disk, his knewfound intellegence run-
509 ning wild on the concept of the disk's locomotion.

511 P.S. I admit my spelling is terrible, most likely why i haven't 
512 started writing till now. I guess I got to many bad strokes about
513 in the the all girls catholic highschool I graduated from 7 years
514 ago.  I used a dictionary on this entry so it shoudl be better,
515 now i have to get my paragraphs working..... so much to do Ieeeee.
516 If i had known about the meeting this afternoon last week i
517 could make it. As it stands now I am on my way to  Seattle for
518 the day. I have some hacker friends up there who have promised
519 me a "fun " day.
520 Also another note about these entries, I have already written
521 5 more chapters but have designed the work with the intent of
522 being read in sections. Something you can't control in a book.

537 Sorry all, can't come this week, it is now 1:25pm on the Saturday afternoon, and I have no transport that will get me 
538 there within even an hour.  I just finished taking the SAT.  I rather enjoyed it, except the analogies & some of the
539 vocabulary words.
540 Voyeur: Number recieved.  It seems to be long distance.  If you have XMODEM protocol, you can upload it to CBBS/PCS, or
541 we can wait until the next meeting I attend.  Wait, L'homme will be coming down here sometime to return my magazines,
542 just give a printout to him.  Thanks for your help (Nuke 'em, Nuke 'em...).
543 +++++++++++++
544 The warm spray of the sea played on the faces of the party.  The waves seemed to dance below, giving me the impression
545 that a celebration was going on.
546 Suddenly, small strips of beach appeared.  We zoomed over the first of them without realizing it, but then slowed so as
547 to be able to scan them more thoroughly.  "A Village", someone muttered.  True enough, a group of squat buildings 
548 appeared to our right.  They were made of an odd glittering material that seemed to dance as the waves did.
549 Mariani was down there, too.  A number of people, about 200 or so, were gathered about him in some sort of meeting.
550 I floated down with no conscious effort on my part.  The others did the same.  Together we approached the gathering. 
551 The people seemed oddly calm toward us.  I assumed they felt as Mariani did, that they would not give up the necklace.
552 I watched them as the meeting drew to a close.  Odd.  I had not heard even a single word being spoken, nor any mental
553 communication.  Still I had the feeling a meeting had been held.  Mariani turned to us.
554 "Seekers, a vote has been taken concerning the necklace.  It has been decided to hear your story.  If you convince us,
555 and help us fight the evil that the necklace fights, we shall surrender it to you.  Do you agree?", Mariani said.
556 We all mumbled an assent.  The others looked to me as if a silent appointment as speaker had been made.  I spoke.
557 "Mariani, our party travelled to the Ruby Valley just to look, and appreciate it.  In our travels we have met evil
558 beings who seek to destroy us, and at first we knew not why.  I have barely escaped death.  We are now aware of our 
559 need for four necklaces, each to be joined together to form one complete necklace.  Each represents a Power.  We have
560 found the powers to destroy and... (I thought for a moment here.  The events whizzed past me, something clicked)... to
561 seek.  Two more are needed.  You have one.  Do you not know what danger there is in this incomplete thing?  I may
562 find something and destroy it, but how will that help good?"
563 Mariani sighed, he seemed to already know this arguement.  "But what shall help us?  If the necklace is not here, a 
564 sickness forms in the water, the very blood of this place.  Many die.  How can I give up this for you?"
565 "How does the necklace prevent this?", I asked.
566 "It is the Third power, that of Healing.", Mariani whispered.
567 "How long does it take for the sickness to form?", I asked.
568 "Only three days.  After that it begins to kill.", Mariani said.
569 "If I were to promise you to return in three days, and give back the necklace, completed or not, would you give it to
570 us?"
571 Mariani was silent.  The people surrounding him were quiet for a moment, then each hummed a certain pitch, in unison.  
572 The hum increased, was louder.  It stopped.
573 "They have agreed.  Return in three days, or", Mariani paused, "we shall die."
574 With that, he removed the Blue necklace from his neck.  It flew through the air, as did its brother, and melded into
575 my necklace.  The whole was now crystal clear.
576 I wondered how to find the last necklace now.  Mariani spoke again.
577 "There is only one more spoke about this wheel left to go.  You must enter the Diamond Valley."
578 "Spoke?  Do you mean", I said, "that this place is but a spoke about a center?  Is that what that room was?"
579 Mariani smiled.  "Yes.  It's opening to this place is to the west.  Just go there, and you shall be quite close to the
580 door to the Diamond Valley.  Farewell, and return!"
581 The others summoned the waters again, and this time I was eager to go on.  The silvery force came easily.  "I promise...
582 ..", I called, as we sped out of sight.

606      First, to kathy:  If you see this (I don't know if you check DB to see
607 if anything has been added), it is good to see writing of your potential
608 here at this Inn.  From what I've seen on these two disks (I haven't been
609 keeping up with things, I'm afraid) you have talent and imagination.  Don't
610 ever let yourself be depressed by the sometimes cruel things people will say
611 here or elsewhere about your writing.  Those that can't (or won't) are
612 always quick to criticize those that can and do.  Just continue to write,
613 and the rest of us will enjoy!
614 
615      Max, you're both right and wrong.  I have at times been frustrated by
616 what seemed to me to be completely uncritical acclaim of my entries, and I 
617 credit that to my gender.  I have made entries under other names (male ones)
618 that have never received the attention that my entries under my real name
619 attract.  But "erotic fantasies"?  I will admit to having such in my private
620 life, but I've never entered anything along those lines HERE.  My writing
621 can be called many things, including silly, self-indulgent, pointless,
622 trivial, or what-have-you, but the term "erotic" implies a certain sexual
623 undertone that I don't believe is present except in the mind of the reader.
624 
625      Hi Mikey!!!!!  I think (hope) I'm entering another creative phase,
626 and as usual I'm going to use events from my life as the basis for my
627 entries.  And special thanks for your defense of my writing.  Out of room!
