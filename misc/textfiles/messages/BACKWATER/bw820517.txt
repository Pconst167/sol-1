228 YES, I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE SYSTEM HAS ATTRACTED SOME RATHER STRANGE USERS.

231 Some people I know have written a program for RSTS/E that
232 resembles DBBS, but they (Gary Moyer, Gordon Moyer, & Tom
233 Tremain) call it TSCS (Time Sharing Comunication System).
234 It would be an ideal BBS except I (as in myself) am writing
235 DBBS. When school starts (UGG!!!!) I will program it into
236 the system that we use, and devote an account to DBBS only.
237 I will give out the password to the account, and give each
238 user an access password with thier own mailbox (mine will
239 be 1 of course, and Adolphs will be 3). I am also tring to
240 get some other people from the asylum to want to use it.

303 
304  Which RSTS system are you using, I have used a couple
305 of different ones in my 7 full years of programming experience
306 (and I not even 16 yet! - 10 days till my birthday).
307  Once you discover UNIX I'm sure you will prefer it -
308 It's like a camera*: SO ADVANCED IT'S SIMPLE!
309 All commands are simply seperate programs - if you want a
310 new command, you just make a program that does what you wish
311 the command to do, and there you have it - all programs are
312 accessed by simply typing the name of the program. If you 
313 prefer BASIC most UNIX systems have a RSTS/E BASIC simulator
314 (much like switching Run-Time Systems on a RSTS system) to use
315 instead of C or Pascal. UNIX should be used for worthwile things
316 while the small, menial tasks can be left to the inferiors!!!
317 (Tek UNIX uses a Z-80 to timeshare the 100 different ports -
318 while the computations are left to the superior DEC processor!)
