47 greetings all,
48     A funny thing happened today.  Let me backup a step...
49 Our class had a algerbra test on tuesday and I was not looking
50 forward to going to class tonight.  (praying for a curve?) I had
51 planned to skip it and guess what happens?  My desk mate calls
52 and tells me that she can't make it and needs to know what homework
53 is going to be assigned tonight.  So I'm a good girl and go to
54 school so my desk mate will know  what her homework will be.
55 I arrive late and find out that the test will not be ready to hand
56 back untill tuesday.(great) I sit through a painful lecture and
57 she almost forgets to assign us homework at the end. In the end
58 I get the homework  assignment and learn a little about functions
59 in the process.  It was like a greater force insisted that I
60 attend school tonight.  But, for what greater purpose.?
61 Just thought Id waste a few lines here on the BWMS, others do, so
62 why not me?

65     Man. Him. She longed for him. It was her way not to show emotion, but in
66 concealing her emotion from others it swelled inside herself. Lust, love, they
67 were just words, symbols for feelings that can never be expressed in words.
68 A hollow in her body told her that she wanted him. The fever in her head
69 confirmed it. Still she could not reveal these passions. When they were
70 together, she was the strong one, only to him. The pain of hiding the pleasure
71 made her strong in his nearness, on the exterior.
72     To tell him with a touch, a kiss, a caress, an embrace, so little, yet
73 so powerful. No, it was not the way. This attachment was not meant to be. How
74 could she go on? Her every waking moment was in dreaming of him. Asleep, awake,
75 her life was of him and for him. In dreams only. It was her different age, as
76 much as his dreams were to him.
77     The visits were difficult. So vulnerable, he laid on his couch, she could
78 see in his eyes what feelings he held for her. To return those feelings, to
79 let him know. How simple. How impossible. It was not her way. It was not
80 allowed. She was not to become emotionally involved with a patient. A patient?
81 A lover. She wanted to forget the instructions. Rules made by people who could
82 not understand feeling. They shared so much. She knew his eyes. She knew him.
83 How natural. She could. She had to. His ascendancy in her mind. She could no
84 longer deny it. It was worth it. The pain it could cause. The price they both
85 would pay. It was no use.
86     A sliver of metal and engine and humanity seeks out a new place. The
87 sounds of the ship notified her of status. A new place would come soon. He
88 was not ready. She could help. It was worth it all. She would go to him.
89 A pulse quickened. The truth. Excitement and wonder. It would not be long
90 now. She knew it well. Star-crossed lovers ever closer to their stars.

190      Where it has never been seen that all men could, in unison, bend knee and
191 pledge loyalty to a single leader, few have maintained that such a world could
192 not exist.  However, what is the loyalty of a man but his desire to secure his
193 life, attain a goal, or perpetuate a philosophy?  Is universal loyalty, then,
194 just a collection of individual goals and desires?  Man is, after all, a selfish
195 beast.  But loyalty does exist -- can the same be said of devotion?  The world
196 cannot revolve about a single man, and though a man may sleep, the world would
197 continue to revolve regardless of who that man may be.

213 A few tricky manouvers were required to guide the Razor's Edge near the edge
214 of the large stream running past the Inn.  Strange- a ship that size should not
215 have fitted into such a small body of water; yet, there it was, twisting the
216 eyes of any watchers.
217 Grann nimbly jumped off the prow and onto the muddy bank, quickly tying the
218 boat onto the small footbridge in order to secure it.  When his task was done,
219 he stopped and watched the many ducks that had gathered on the stiller portions
220 of the stream.  After a bit, he pulled out a package of pastry squares and fed
221 a few to the ducks, yet more to himself.
222 The green-eyed mage lightly dropped over the side, and motioned to Grann who
223 had somehow finished the entire box of pastries.
224 A few hurried steps brought them to the front door of the Inn.  A few more 
225 carried them to a meeting room, far in the back of the main common area, where
226 other cloaked figures sat talking.
227 What did they discuss?  Did a new danger threaten Innisfal?  An old enemy?
228 Did the figures discuss the true nature of the universe, or at least that one?
229 Perhaps all or none of these.  But pleasant hours were passed, regardless of
230 the topic of discussion.  And perhaps a few good ideas got their start there.

273 Books: Due to school, I haven't much time to give to leisure reading, but I

393 
394  
395 1. Acquisition of the Nuclear Option
396  
397 	a) You may receive one Nuke and two armies in place of
398 the normal number of armies when you turn in cards at the
399 beginning of your turn (Or when you capture another players
400 cards) provided one of the following conditions are meet.
401  
402 	1) At least one of the three cards you turn in is a
403 country that you occupy. The Nuke will be placed on one of the
404 afore mentioned countries that you occupy. In addition you get
405 two Armies to strengthen your Nuclear base to be placed on the
406 same country as the Nuke.
407  
408 	2) You play a Wild card, in lieu of a card whose
409 country you occupy, for Nuclear placement. You may use the Wild
410 card to improve the security of your installation i.e. Place it
411 in a well fortified area behind the front lines. However beware
412 someone may pull that card and Nuke your installation.
413  
414 2. Use of the Nuclear Option
415  
416 	a) Offensive Use
417  
418 	Nuclear deployment can only occur at the beginning of
419 your turn. Your available targets are determined by the cards
420 you hold. (Wild cards cannot be used for target designation) Or
421 after you have captured another players cards and turn them in
422 for credit.
423  
424 	b) Defensive Use
425  
426 	A player may only use their Nuclear arms when the are
427 being attacked. The nuclear option exists as long as the player
428 is under attack. The player is under no obligation to inform
429 anyone of impending retaliation. The only target limitation
430 being the cards the player holds. (One special case exists.
431 i.e. It is Blacks turn. Black attacks Red who launches and
432 destroys a country Green holds. Green now has the Nuclear
433 Option to retaliate against whatever targets he has.)
434  
435 	1) Defensive Launch
436  
437 	The primary defender (Player being conventionally
438 attacked) may launch after he has beaten the attacking player
439 in a roll of the dice in lieu of the attacking player removing
440 the armies he lost in the roll. A split is sufficient. *NOTE
441 Once a Nuclear exchange has begun it can continue until the
442 last player effected cannot or chooses not to continue. (i.e.
443 Green launches against Red who launches against Blue who
444 launches Yellow who launches against Black who has Nuclear
445 capability but chooses not to launch.
446  
447 3. Discussion & Miscellaneous Rules
448  
449 	Targets - are determined by the cards you hold. They
450 are played by laying the chosen card face up on the board. It
451 is then returned to the card stack and shuffled back into the
452 deck.
453  
454 	Cards - After any cards are played they are then
455 shuffled back into the deck for potential reuse by another
456 player.
457  
458 	Dead Zones - A dead zone is established whenever a
459 country is has been target of a nuclear exchange and remains a
460 Dead Zone for the rest of the game. No player may occupy a Dead
461 Zone however players may pass through a D.Z. at a cost of half
462 of their forces plus one army. The armies are removed when
463 entering the D.Z. Armies awarded for holding a continent for
464 one turn are not awarded if that continent has a D.Z. If a
465 country has been the site of more than one nuclear strike it
466 cannot be held or crossed for the remainder of the game. In the
467 event that it is impossible to capture all the armies a draw
468 will be declared between the remaining forces.
469  
470 	Capture of a Nuke - When a nuclear base is under attack
471 it is the defenders choice to launch if he beats the attackers
472 roll however if the defender loses all the armies around the
473 nuclear site that country is overrun by the attacker. And the
474 occupier of the country has control over the site. The only
475 exception is that should the original owner of the silo have
476 the card for that country he may at the beginning of his turn
477 detonate the nuke in its silo.
478  
479 	Rearming existing silos - Any player may rearm any
480 site that currently has an existing weapon or empty silo.
481 Providing the player owns that country. Rearming happens at
482 the beginning of each player turn when he turns in cards and
483 requests a Nuke or after the capture of another players cards
484 and turns them in.
485  
486 	Army count - Every time a set of cards are turned in
487 the count of armies increases. However when the count reaches
488 ten armies only cards turned in for Armies increase the count,
489 cards turned in for Nukes after ten Armies are reached do not
490 increase the count.

516 As Mark sat drinking his morning Pepsi he contemplated the major thoughts
517 of the day. 'What the Hell ?? A car speeding off its present course on 
518 the highway, & crashing into a Mobil Stations 30 FT. tall sign. Jesus..'
519 he muttered as he stepped out of the resteraunt to go scheck the 
520 accident "these drwers, Chao !!" He tripped over something in his path..
521 "OH GOD" He screamed & bolted upright, shocked into trembling fear at 
522 what he saw, it was a burnt body, its mouth frozen open in a soundless 
523 cry of terror, burnt by tremendous heat.  By it were, tiny three toed 
524 tracts.  Then the flood of darkness swept over him, He felt himself 
525 being moved,   Were ??
526 
527               HOME ?
528 Were was he ? was he home ?  Yes he was home. BUt How ......
529 He staggered to his feet, his head pounding in shock of what he just saw 
530 the falling, the seeing of the body, the tracts ?? Trscks..?
531 What the hell kind of animal makes three toed tracks ?
532 He staggeres slowly out into the livingroom, distinguishing the round,
533 soft familier shapes in the darkness. "Dad ?.."  He fumbiled for the 
534 light swich,,'Click', no power ? For a instant his heart sped up, He was
535 always been affraid of blackouts.
536 There was someone down in the basement that secpund, but they werent 
537 fixing fuses...  He slowly walked into the kitchen, the unowem was cold 
538 on his feet even though he had wolen socks. 'BRRRRRR..' he mumbled as 
539 his hand supped into a silverware drawer. out of it he pulled a penlite 
540 flashlight, He pushed the tiny swich, Nouthing, He almost anticipated it.
541 "Just like every thing else in this house, Junked up!" He unscrewed the 
542 small metal case it made a protesting scraping noise, & finely opened, 
543 hanging its rusty-looking contents over to the Victor..

606 better than waiting in anticipation for a reply,  call my board at 777-xxxx,
607 I'm one of the FEW sysops who actually answers a chat request.  Or so I've
608 been told anyway.  It's a pretty good board,  it's got a 'Creative Writing'
609 section and I just ran out of room,  feel free to call.           Darbon++++++++
