20 OK, FOR THE MOMENT LET'S ASSUME THAT COMPUTERS ARE ALIVE.
21 THE QUESTION IS, ARE THEY 'MALE' OR 'FEMALE'?
22 THE NEXT QUESTION IS, 'IS BACKWATER MALE OR FEMALE?'
23 ******************** CISTOP MIKEY *************************
24 Malcom: Just rotten timimg is all. BW has shifted to its debate
25 phase. That isn't to say that you can't write stories, as is
26 idicated by those that are writing them. It is only that those
27 who were doing the NET thing got tired of it for awhile and
28 have moved on to other things until their mental batteries have
29 had a chance to recharge. Mean while, those who can create and
30 write continue to do so. Why not do something of your own writing.

35 it started getting dark. He scooped everything off his desk and threw it
36 into a drawer. I must be crazy, he thought, going over there twice in one
37 day. Maybe I should try to forget about the past, about Magen and all the
38 things we once meant to each other. Something still tugged at his inner
39 being as he rushed out of the office, taking the stairs two at a time, in a
40 headlong dash to the plant entrance. Raza was one of the hundred or so
41 people on the island who now had an automobile. He jumped in his car and
42 pulled out on to the road with a lurch, the instant the engine started.
43    Dixie had been standing in the lobby talking with the receptionist while
44 she waited for a taxi to drive her to the hotel. Raza rushed by so quickly
45 he had not even seen her standing there. She had, however, seen him quite
46 clearly. Before she could say anything he had bounded out the door and
47 driven away. She noted that he had not headed toward town.
48    A few minutes later Raza came to the end of the road. It was a half mile
49 further to the bay where Magen was living but he would have to walk from
50 here. Fortunately he could walk along the narrow beach below the cliffs.
51 This was the one part of the island that still did not have any roads. Raza
52 live. One thing she disliked almost as much as the hum was cars. She had
53 refused to even ride in one. Raza decided he would have to be firm with her
54 about some of her strange antiquated ideas. Progress had come to the island.

56 piper---Thank you. Your fine writing style would lead me to believe that you
57   are probably a professional wordsmith in at least one of your personas. If
58   you could give me a tip or two concerning pacing of a story I would sure
59   appreciate it. I feel it's one of the weak areas in my writing.

61 P.S. CISTOP MIKEY---Thanks for the explanation, it's a shame some people do
62    those kind of things.
63   Thank you very much for recovering the deleted lines. I appreciate it.

74 Malcolm: No one is ignoring you. Even with the great resources of the NET, we still have problems logging on
75 to backwater. You have been on three times since the last time I was on. At night, the phones are
76 so busy it is nearly impossible to get on without attack dialers. Please contineu your story with NET if
77 you wish. Although two main characters are out-of-town/unable to respond, the rest of us are still
78  nterested in keeping some story going. Expect a big entry from Gaudy Minsky any time now.
79  ilch: Feb sounds fine. When we get a little closer, I'll give you some possible days/times. I'll warn
80 Chuck about the logo!
81 Farley, Gaius: Please don't give up. I can't enter a story now, but I will next time I log on. I have
82 talked to Gaudy, and she is working on a continuation of the story.
83 Kathy:Glad to hear you avoid those little beasts. Sometimes they seem to jump out of thin air. Say hi to the ski
84 patrol for me. (another long story)
85 Alchemist: Sometimes rapier wit can be a double-edged sword. Someone always seems to take things the wrong way. It
86 is refreshing to see someone who can thrust/parry without tripping. My mug of ale is raised to you too.
87 Alex: I found another Risk groupie from the crowd at PPS. When ever you decide its time to clash those armies
88 again, count us in. I am learning a great deal in my Statistics class. We are doing quite a bit of theory work
89 interesting plans for our next game, but I may have to borrow one of Leonard's little Model 100s first. (hear
90 that Leonard??? haha)

97 SARAH OR LADY S:
98   Homo Sapien walked swiftly across the icy snow. He began to jog. And strained
99  is eyes against the wind, looking. Days had flown by in search. Now, he was
100  o reach his destination. Protected by varies man-made devices, he hunted along
101  n his search, unknown to the dwealers of the artic land. 
102    Homo sapien, The Wise, spied the great animal. Ursus maritimus, Of th Sea,
103 remained stiffly elert. His nose raised in the air. Ursus maritimus did not
104 smell Homo sapien. A young seal, below the snow, lifted his head to breathe.
105 The seal went unnoticed by Homo sapien, but apon smelling the foul breathe,
106 Ursus maritimus pounced on the seal. The animal moved rapidly, all of the 
107 muscles in his body cooperated. His paws slapped down on the terror-stricken
108 seal his great jaws tore into the seals flesh.
109   After consuming his meal, the great beast rose to his full height. Five
110 feet at the shoulder, he stood. Ursus maritimus weighed about 1,000 pounds,
111 yet he walked gracefully, a figure of power. The strenght in his gait, 
112 shone through his heavy portective coat. He starred with keen eyes across
113 the blanket of whiteness. Proud, dignified, he walked.
114    Homo sapien raised his gun in the air. He took a seconds aim at the great
115 beast. He fired. The bear fell instantly to the ground. Human smiled at his
116 success and walked to the bear. He stood above and starred down at the 
117 conquered beast. One eye of Bear was rolled back in his head and the other
118 lay bloodied by his nose. By the nose which had brought him food, apon the
119 death of the small, helpless creature. Bear breathed shallowly. Human kicked
120 the side of Bear's head. Bear remained alive. Human reached swiftly, gracefully
121 to his belt. He withdrew his hunting knife and implanted it in Bear's skull.
122 Blood spilled out over Human's hand. The redness continued to drowned Bear's
123 white face as Human continued to stab. Human stopped abruptly. Saticfied he
124 turned on his heel and went to call his friends, showing them of his power
125 they had doubted. Human walked across the snow, Seal's foul breathe went 
126 unnoticed by he and the dead polar bear.
127    
128 Okay. So, Sarah, did you say that murder can be done only to intelligent 
129 creatures. Does Bear qualify as intelligent? Does Human? Does Seal? What
130 are Bear's actions? What are Human's? Bear killed for food? What were 
131 Human's reasons for killing? WAS IT MURDER? WHY OR WHY NOT? Please write
132 a five paragraph essay and print it by tommarow. You will be graded on
133 your skill to define... No, really. Please respond. Don't expect me to.
134 I am now returning to my lurker state and do not expect to be summoned
135 out of it until I'm a little more-- Oh, never mind! "Hi, Sondargaard. I
136 missed you this afternoon. Don't believe anything Prometheus said."
137   Mr. Parity  -  I have been home very sick and therefore easy access to
138 BWMS because of the weird hours.  Nothing better to do than enrich one's
139 mind as the body swiftly rots.  Later I shall not be able to get on as
140 often when I am healthy again.  I shall write though.

142 THIS IS A BORDER. DEFINING ONE MESSAGE FROM THE OTHER.
143 SARAH: I wrote you a message. About Bear and stuff. I did not write 
144 anything to L'homme sans Parity. It appears that part of my message 
145 was eaten up, by some evil god (or more likely a twit). So, I don't
146 care if you disregard it or not. LET'S GO TO ENTER ONLY. I think 
147 somebody on all BBSs is against me. My messages appear to be followed
148 by some sort of calamity or just somebody who hates them. I'm going
149 to forget this message writing business. The only reason for 
150 writing now, is to say it was not Malcolm who sent you that 
151 message. And, I'm sorry to have tied up the system while wri
152 ng it. Now something else is freaking out on me here. So, I had better
153 take my leave. -Tanya
154 THIS IS THE REST AF THE BOARDER. TO DISTINGUISH ONE MESSAGE FROM ANOTHER.
155 Cistop: I think lines are still disappearing.  Some of the preceding entries
156 on this disk seem disjointed (more so than can be attributed to the authors).

166 The winter wind whistled by.  Although the clouds foretold foul weather, I had
167 braved the elements in order to discover the strange disturbance in the world.
168 The other Masters were dependant on me, for I was the one chosen by all.  If
169 only I knew more of my craft...
170 I glided down toward the earth.  The bare fingers of the trees below reached 
171 up as if to grab me.  I avoided them, perhaps unneedfully.  A clearing gave me
172 a perfect opprotunity to Change.
173 A Changing is a peculiar thing, for it happens all at once, instead of in the
174 stages one might expect.  Properly done, A viewer would see a man standing
175 one moment, and another creature sitting/swimming/flying there the next.
176 My Changing ability was improving, but it still lacked the grace of an 
177 experienced Master.  How unlucky was I, to have been selected so soon after my
178 appointment to thegrey robes of a Master!
179 After I was through the Change, I shivered.  My clothes had changed with me, 
180 but the lands I had departed were sunny at this time of year.  I sought the
181 shelter I had seen from above.
182 A building of some sort, an inn I suppose, soon came into view.  Light spilled
183 from the window, telling of the warmth and cheer within.
184 I started eagerly toward it, but stopped abruptly.  This place was the source
185 of the disturbance, I could tell.  I began forward again, but now approaching
186 more cautiously.
187 I opened the door, slipped inside, and closed it behind me.  There's no
188 describing the collection of faces, voices, and accents that filled the room,
189 not to mention the uncountable opinions and inestimable knowledge.  I asked, in
190 a quavering voice, "What is it that I sense here?"
191 For a bit, there was silence.  Then a man, his name unknown to me, spoke.
192 "Why, It's merely debate time again."
193 That said, the discussion continued.  The subject of the moment seemed to be
194 the nature of life, and of intelligence.  I had no strong feelings in the
195 matter- that which seems to live, is alive.  No other definition will serve
196 better.
197 And so, that thought out, I made my way toward a corner of the room so that I
198 might sit, and watch awhile.

240 Jack has his own fashion idea's, nurd city but he's smart and I know you will

248 -structure- of the material. Although cipher is unreadable in it's jumbled
249 form, if it would be re-arranged, filled with spacing and punctuation, and
250 whatever else it could take on an index anywhere from a 1 to a 15 depending 
251 what the final outcome of the last jumble did to it.       so there.
252      Now that I've given you what one of my instructors has told me about it,

265    Melissa -- 'tis I who must thank you!  Unfortunately, I must plead that
266 I feel totally inadequate to offer tips on the pacing of your story, it 
267 seems to be moving quite well and I am anticipating each entry with great
268 pleasure.  Really, you must remember that I am the one hardest hit by the
269 dreaded fog index -- I recieved an impenetrable 13 -- a sure sign that my
270 compositions are dense and unreadable other than by those who are educated
271 beyond normal levels.  I'm sure that a large part of this intolerably high
272 index is caused by my bizarre and convoluted sentence structure; my 
273 sentences are affected by my Germanic heritage -- I plunge in at the beginning
274 and continue through, until I emerge spluttering and blowing several
275 paragraphs later.  Looking at the previous sentence, I believe it!
276   All -- the cycle of the inn continues.  Cycles, cycles within cycles, and
277 cycles containing cycles.  From nearly moribund to bursting with vitality,
278 the pace of life moves on.  I cast the Oracle and was reminded of the
279 transience of any state of being.  Nature does not abhor a vacuum, she
280 simply prefers a dynamic to a static balance.

283     Many conversations swirled around the Inn, some adding to the flavor and

285 could say with certainty which served the greater purpose, each in its own
286 way served a function in the totality that all knew as the Inn.

324 see the horizon he knew by the colors that sunset was about an hour away. If

326 it started getting dark.

329 suspected that was part of the reason Magen had chosen it as a place to

343 Note: the following song requires a bit of explanation. The "Star-Spangled

346         To Anacreon in Heaven (words: Ralph Tomlinson,Esq.; Music: John

348 To Anacreon in Heav'n,
349 Where he sat in full glee,
350 A few Sons of Harmony sent a petition
351 That he their Inspirer and Patron would be;
352 When this answer arrived from the Jolly Old Grecian:
353 "Voice, Fiddle, and Flute,
354 No longer be mute,
355 I'll lend you my name and inspire you to boot,
356 Chorus: And besides I'll instruct you, like me, to intwine
357         The Mrytle of Venus with Bacchus's wine." (repeat chorus)
358 The news through Olympus immediately flew;
359 When Old Thunder pretended to give himself airs.
360 "If these Mortals are suffered their scheme to pursue,
361 The Devil, a Goddess, will stay above stairs.
362 Hark, already they cry,
363 In transports of joy,
364 'Away to the Sons of Anacreon we'll fly,
365 Chorus: And there with good fellows, we'll learn to intwine
366         The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.' (repeat chorus)
367 "The Yellow-Haired God and his nine fusty Maids
368 From Helicon's banks will incontinent flee,

370 And the bi-forked hill a mere desert will be.
371 My Thunder no fear on't
372 Shall soon do its errand,
373 
374 And dam'me I'll swing the Ringleaders I warrant.
375 Chorus: I'll trim the young dogs, for thus daring to twine
376         The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine."
377 Apollo rose up, and said, "Pry'thee ne'er quarrel,
378 Good King of the Gods, with My Vot'ries below:
379 Your Thunder is useless" -- then showing his laurel,
380 Cry'd "Sic evitable fulmen, you know!
381 Then over each head
382 My laurels I'll spread,
383 So my sons from your Crackers no mischief shall dread,
384 Chorus: While, snug in their clubroom, they jovially twine
385         The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine."
386 Next Momus got up with his risible Phiz
387 And swore with Apollo he'd cheerfully join --
388 "The full tide of Harmony still shall be his,
389 But the Song, and the Catch, and the Laugh shall be mine.
390 Then, Jove, be not jealous
391 Of these honest fellows."
392 Cry'd Jove, "We relent, since the truth you now tell us;
393 Chorus: And swear by Old Styx, that they long shall intwine
394         The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine."
395 Ye sons of Anacreon, then join hand in hand;
396 Preserve Unaimity, Friendship, and Love!
397 'Tis your to support what's so happily plann'd;
398 You've the sanction of Gods, and the Fiat of Jove.
399 While thus we agree,
400 Our toast let it be:
401 "May our Club flourish Happy, United, and Free!
402 Chorus: And long my the Sons of Anacreon intwine
403         The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine."
404 
405                 As sung at the Crown Anchor Tavern in the Strand,,
406                 circa 1780

408 Sorry about the typos in the last line of the first Chorus...

414 Kathy,
415    If you are the same Kathy I am thinking of then you have called
416 The Alternate World and are a user. if not then please ignore this
417 little mumbling of a tired old programmer. But if you are that 
418 particular person then I just wanted to tell you that you have
419 mail on the formentioned BBS. It is from me and since you changed
420 your name on the system you didnt get it. so i have changed the 
421 name on the roster and you are using your newly assigned password.
422 Anyway...... I left a small little peice of info on here too, and
423 it seems to be missing..... hmmmm.... well i figure it was close
424 to the part of a story that someone above lost so i guess my
425 stuff went with it. OH WELL..... Anyway.. it was concerning the
426 way to determine whether your computer is male or female. If 
427 anyone is interested in this step by step tutorial please leave
428 me an indication of such so i can repost it.

433 Yet another lurker in the midst of backwater.  Peering through the fog.
434 I have finally decided that peering may not be enought however, but
435 keeping in mind my intimadation level (basically very insecure) this 
436 seems to be the best place to start. Being the most anonouse
437 
438 I can find, and therefor the most protected, my courage is at an all 
439 time high.
440 
441 
442                   It is warm here, soft and full of
443                                life.
444                   From the beginning this has been my
445                                world.
446                My mother made this place, a small place of
447                   twigs and bits of the other world.
448                   
449                     She knows so much of that world.
450                   Each day I see my mother dissapear and
451                             then return.
452                   She leaves my world on huge dark
453                                wings.
454                            into the unknown.
455                   A place I know in my heart I can 
456                             never go.
457 
458                   But I know in my heart I can never
459                   But I know there is something outside
460                              my world,
461 
462 
463                        And I have wings too.

480 ADRIAN: Thanks for peering face to light. Don't be so apologetic, you
481 have nothing to apologize for. Good stuff! Really... 
482 
483 ALL: It may appear that I am constantly complimentary, but that is 
484 because I constantly enjoy. But, believe me, I don't lie. And,
485 besides everybody needs it now and then. (I just noticed that I made
486 a mistake above change the latter part of that sentence two lines 
487 above to: ...because I constantly enjoy when coming to the Inn and 
488 listening to tales and discussions).
489 
490 GAURDIAN: I think (but I'm not quite sure) that the person who said
491 "Hi" was Tanya. She wrote the Bear story (as she later said to Sarah
492 in her next message). It could have been Malcolm. I don't know. The
493 reason I comment is because if it is Tanya, she said that she was
494 entering a lurking mode. I think that's who it was. But, whoever
495 it is: feel free to prove me wrong, or if it's Tanya, speak up!

497 <{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}>
498 Is it the time for all lurkers to come out of the woodwork and enter
499 stories?  I've been around this Inn for a long time, have seen many
500 different people come and go, but never have I entered a message before.
501 It's kinda strange, any way - is this the time?  Will the PROPHESY come
502 alive, will the lurkers finally burst from that dark corner where they have
503 been waiting for so long?  Maybe.  I'll have to stick around to see.
504 <{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}><{}>
505 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ETC.^^^^^^^^^^^^^
506 I to have a desire to speak to tanya.  Let us hope to awaken the sleep-
507 er.  In my lurking on another system I came across some rather unkind
508 words towards the lady.  However loud this voice, it speaks for few. If
509 you are lurking out there, check the aloha cbbs, something about pira-
510 mids there that looked interesting.
511 
512 Thank you to "|_|_|" whoever you are, I appreciate the feedback.  The 
513 first breaths are allways the most painfull.

518 Adrian, Have you ever been "Logan"?
519 Prometheus, With all due respect, I would prefer to be  invited by those doing the actual inviting. No offense intended,
520 it's just that it can get a bit embarrassing to show up someplace, only to find out that that you were not actually on the
521 list. I speak from experience.
522 ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
523      Perhaps a good definition of intelligence is the ability to make decisions.
524 ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
525 Oops. Please ignore that last line, it was to be followed by more, but it seemed to be a bit self-defeating.
526 ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
527 Tammy, Are you still around? LKindly leave me a message on Le Nerd either admitting or denying this. By the way, are you 
528 still planning on leaving your story here? I'd really love to see it as it sounds quite promising.
529 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZJZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZippy
530     I feel that I must apologize for any typo-oid mistakes in my entries. Alas, the primary problem with living with
531 people who don't understand the concept of carrier tones.
532 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZippy
533 I am mostly a "lurker" as has been confessed previous to this.  Occasionally I
534 have spoken, but to no notice.  My story has not yet been formed, but I love
535 the Inn and wish for more knowledge of it.  
536 Adrian:  You did very well--very enjoyable.  
537 Melissa:  You did well also; I believe you're new as well.  
538 ZZZZZZippy:  you have promise.

543 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ the return of PaPa Smurf
544 ALL:  Well, well, well,  hello again to all.  Yes I'm still here but
545 I did finally miss a disk.  Such is life.   Messages follow:
546 BARD:  I liked the song and thanks for the common boarders.  I feel honored
547        to share them with the likes of you.
548 ZZZIPPY:  Yes you are invited.  So be there or your zip will get zapped!!
549 ADRIAN:  I liked your poem but it looked like it took up a lot of lines.
550          If you've lurked here before, you should know about line waste.
551 MILCHAR: I would have to say that BackWater is alive.  Just remember when
552          Cistop Mikey said he had had it and was going to murder the system.
553          Now didn't you feel like he was killing BW?  I did, and I'm glad the
554          govenor called in with the pardon in time.
555 CISTOP MIKEY:  I would say the system is UNI-SEXED.  It's in that third gray
556          sexed area of 'LIFE'.   Life of the inadimate.
557 JIZ:  Go for it.
558 PIPER:  I liked the short on the animals.  It almost brought tears.
559 MALCOLM:  Murder of Bear/Seal/Human .... Hmmm, interesting.  To say the 
560      least of "Don't believe anything Prometheus said."  Your on my
561      "findout more about" list now.   So watch it.
562 KATHY and the ski patrol, hmmmm, interesting.  Sounds like a good story.
563 GUARDIAN: "dicretion in the matter of belief right next to twilight zone
564     music.   Cute!  When one does get on, he does still understand lots.
565 POLICEMAN:  I must issue my vote as well.  Sorry, but  I DON'T LIKE IT.
566 LADY S.:  So nice to have our little chat earlier tonight.  We must get
567     together sometime so we can chat face-to-face.  I can understand you
568     problem leaving messages on this board.  No personal interaction.
569     But please don't let that deter you.  I do agree with your view of
570     life.  The limits as set by the Supreme Court fit me just fine.  My
571     MAJOR point is that NO ONE has the right to force their own moral
572     values upon someone else.  ie. Just because person A would never have
573     an abortion, does not mean that person B (who has to live with the
574     decision) can not have one.  I feel that that is a choice that eavh
575     and every person must take for themselves.  A side note is that during
576     the day shift at work (THE LAB) I processed a 14-year old prenatal
577     lab request and a 15 year old heterphil screen request for a male not
578     to mention the 16 year old semen GC speciemen.  These were POSITIVE.
579     ie. A 14 year old girl is pregnet, a 15 year old male has MONO and
580     a 16 year old male has GC (a form of VD).  The first step to any
581     kind of choice on abortion must be the decision of SAFE SEX.  With
582     the contaceptives on the market, people should be more carful and
583     think of the results of their night in the hay.  Sowing ones oats
584     is one thing, being pregnet or having VD or even AIDS in the morning
585     is another.  And yes, I get AIDS samples to process as well.
586 MISC>>>> I for one understand the wee hours of the morning.  I don't
587   partake in them very often since I must be at the lab by 7:30 and
588   be awake, but my roommate does.  Finding him in the chair with earplugs
589   on and the stero long since shut off when I get up, is proof of the
590   essence of life in the wee hours.  ALEX putting things in to someone's
591   dream seems to be along the same line.  With little sleep, it is a lot
592   easier to place things into dreams.
593 NET HELP NEEDED:  I wish you guys would locate that TWIT HUNTING GEAR.  This
594   is getting to be a bit much.  Get your act together.
595 MASTER CHANGER:  I have just about come full circle with the INN.  I have
596   now lived thru the three major avenues of INN LIFE and understand the
597   need for this very change.  I is very interesting to watch it change
598   and also to know a few of the people.  Their moods change a bit, not
599   to much mind you, but a little.  The quality of minds that makeup this
600   (the) life of BackWater, is a very interesting mixture.  Each and every
601   regular user contributes a part of themselves to the collected life
602   essence of the thing we call BACKWATER MESSAGE SERVICE.  Some of 
603   use live to dial that number and findout what maybe new.  Its like
604   calling a friend on the phone.  You converse with them, and then hang
605   up to yet call again.  I look forward to many wonderful hours of
606   talking with my 'friends', here at the INN, before I too must eventually
607   depart this BACKWATER LIFE of mine.  A thing that we must all face,
608   sooner or later.
609 ~~~~~~~~
610 With that thought, and being at the end of the disk (or close), I must
611 bit my friend GOODNIGHT.  I must hang up now, but I will call back.
612 For while I am here, I have BACKWATER in my blood.
613   If it is not alive, then I don't know what is.
614                                GOODNIGHT

618 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (sssss... >click<... )
619 PaPa:   Glad to see you've returned. I might like to mention why I fall asleep with those thingys poked in my ears though.
620 of music...  I have found that the 'mood for the night' may relatively be governed by the 'atmosphere' of your surroundings
621    while you are in the procces of falling asleep. I very much prefer to listen to recordings of FRESH AIRE or ENVIRONMENTS
622    or maybe even JEAN-MICHEL JARRE. Those of you familiar with these names know what I'm getting at.  What I do to REALLY
623    get into a relaxed mood is to get everything ready for sleeping and then lie down. Once I am ready, I put on (in) the 
624    'phones. After taking about a minute to completely relax, I then turn on the music and let it have at 'soothing the savage
625    [beast]'.  All I can say is that with relaxing music, I actually awake somewhat refreshed. Once I left my radio on, by 
626    mistake, and fell asleep to a station that I normally didn't listen to (KRCK 101 FM, metal junk) and had horrid results...
627    I awoke about two hours before I had to get up and found that I had not gotten any rest what-so-ever. Nightmares were
628 rampant.  "...feel the noize..."  <moan>  "Bang your head..."  <toss, turn>     Not at all the sort of gloom anyone other
629 than a metal-head deserves. I'll tell the rest later, I think that I've just hogged the disk...^^^^^^^^^^   --->the Guardian
