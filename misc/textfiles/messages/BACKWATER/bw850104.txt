30 All: Does anyone out there beleive the claptrap the Lane County Prosecutor's Office is giving out about the gun they 
31  ound ( in connection with the Diane Downs murder case ) bearing a duplicate serial number? I have worked with serial-
32 numbered items as a salesman for six years and have NEVER heard of ANY instance of even the shoddiest vendor duplicating
33 a serial number. Sometimes, for very specific purposes, they will leave them off entirely, but NEVER a duplication.
34 I have a lot more faith in the Ruger company official who testified at the trial that duplicate serial numbers were
35 (are)impossible than I have in the Lane County officials' ability to admit that the entire case they made against Ms.
36 Downs collapses in the light of this new evidence. Such an admission would show them up as fools (read:normal humans) on
37 a national scale. It's much easier to say that the "impossible" has occurred. As far as I can tell, Ms. Downs hasn't 
38 both oars in the water, but that doesn't make her a killer. Let's hope the Attorney General (or someone) reopens the 
39 case; if we're going to punish someone for murder, let's be absolutely SURE we have the right person.

76   tilean pressed the start button... the microwave started humming... soon it
77  ould peirce the air with a damnable whine... telling everyone just how done it
78  as... demanding that whatever was in it be taken away... obnoxious little
79 things microwaves were...
80 
81   tilean waited until the timer said it was down to four seconds left... and
82 pressed the stop button quickly... avoiding the peircing tone altogether...
83   a tactic he would have to remember later tonight... a long evening was in
84 store... wading through all sorts of reports... net agencies right and left...
85  nd some agency making an appearence that would apparently be formidable to get
86 rid of...
87 
88   tilean sat down at the terminal... a login prompt was waiting... he typed the
89 appropriate thirty character sstring... waited for the password keys... typed
90 in the appropriate thirty character string... waited... and then was allowed
91 access to his account... with master priviledges to all of thrike's database...
92 
93   tilean called up the latest reports of net activities in the portland area...
94  oshua was alive... dangerfield was dead... joshua got him that way...  all the
95 press agencies were told that dangerfield died of xenopolycythemia... a disease
96 often used to explain the deaths of imprtant people... it did not really exist
97 and almost every agency knew it... it was easily induced into a corpse... and
98 explained all sorts of skin diseases... especially bullet holes...
99 
100   agent minsky of net had also dissapeared... perhaps she was making sure of
101  angefield's death... perhaps she was also investigating the mappearence of a
102 new agency in the region... preliminary reports added no information to the
103 little mention in history section... information confiscation... underground...
104 a cocky little government group rarely known to make mistakes... not too obnox-
105 ious... perhaps that would explain the sudden appearence...
106 
107  agent farley had also dissapeared... wherabouts unknown... possibly recalled
108 by net... oddd situation there... recruited by pseudonet... left pseudonet for
109 net... and now operating free lance... at least that is what reports said... it
110 was possible that no one had the right information... only farley could tell
111  or sure... maybe not even him... that would not be new...
112 
113   soviet submarine was due to be passing through the puget sound now... in all
114 likelyhood would be discovered by USS Forrestal currently docked in Seattle...
115   american ship Forrestal was draping a communications net around the pacific
116 ocean... it was to intercept all military and paramilitary signals... decode...
117 or deciper... and then relay to the american hydra computers... thrike did not
118 mind... it would also relay to thrike communications agencies all around the
119 pacific... no problems there...
120 
121   american communications tap was named drape... it was not named by american
122 scientists... instead... tilean had inserted the name into preliminary reports
123 and no one noticed... a lot of *fun* these terminals...
124 
125 ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
126 
127   everyone is pretty confused around here... farley... you tell us where and
128 why you are... that seems like it would be the most agreeable way to proceed...
129 What is it? tylian or tilean?

132 NET member who sent me code on last disk: It was garbaged before I got to it.  Only a half-sentence was recoverable.
133  'homme: Chuck seemed pleased with the info I gave him... it must have been those articles which I eventually found.
134  $##$##$##$##$##$##$##$#
135 I hadn't heard a thing so far.  All of the corridors here, in fact, seemed a bit *TOO* quiet.
136 Hurrying along one side of the hall, I tried to think how I got here.  After much straining of my grey matter, I gave
137 it up.  No answers to be gained there.
138  t last, I sighted the Security room the men had been talking about.  The door was open, and as I peeped around the
139  dge, my ears were greeted with the sound of a card game.  My belongings were lying on a nearby counter... how sloppy 
140  f them.
141   crawled in, moving slowly toward my things.  The thin smoke that emanated from the ashtrays and tobacco at the card
142  able did it's small part in concealing my movement.
143  t last, I reached the table.  Obviously, no one had taken time to examine my things- they had just been put aside.
144 I hoped that my abilities would be as underestimated as this in the future.
145 Carefully, I put each item in my pocket, except Betsy.  Harumph.  They'd even neglected to empty her.
146 I crawled out of the room with no trouble.  Only then did I allow myself to breathe again.
147 Again I made my way carefully down the corridor.  I came across several doors, but they were all clearly marked as
148 something else. Offices, janitors rooms, emergency exit, cell area b...
149 EMERGENCY EXIT?
150   found the door I wanted, pulled at the handle.  It wouldn't budge.  I thought of using Betsy on the lock, but the
151 noise would attract unwanted spectators.
152 I looked again at the door lock.  A keyhole, and a small slit.
153 Slit?  A flash of inspiration.  I shoved the passcard into the slit.
154 Click.  The door came open.  A narrow passage beyond was visible.
155 Running down the passage, I nearly ran into another door.  This one was the standard push-type, however, and I wasted
156 no time in using it.
157 WHOOOP!  WHOOOP!  WHOOOP!  Drat, an alarm.  I sprang through the door.
158 I found myself on the lowest level of a multi-level parking facility, the level reserved for "the management".
159  nbelievably, Fred was parked nearby.  I jumped in, gunned the engine, and drove as quickly out of there as possible.
160   *ALMOST* didn't see the bright blue dot of a laser trace a line across the side of the concrete wall before me.
161 I didn't question who, or why, but just kept driving.  A momentary glimpse from the rear-view mirror told me all I 
162 needed to know.
163 A small drone, about 2' in diameter, floated above the VW bug that was obviously designed to carry it.  One of its
164 various appendages was the source of that Medusa's gaze.
165 I also saw something else in that brief moment.  Three men had followed me out, just moments behind.
166 They lay on the ground, cleanly cut in two.
167 I pushed the accelerator harder.  In a few minutes, I was sure that no one had followed me.
168 "Fred?", I said.  No reply.
169 Again I called for his attention.  Still no reply.
170  amn, they must've disconnected him.  I hope those manuals are accurate...
171 My thoughts were broken into by the strange behavior of one of those electronic bulb-signs you see in front of banks.
172 This one read, as it scrolled by, "FARLEY-COMPUTER LINKS I STILL HAVE. UNABLE TO DRIVE THOUGH. REPAIR REQUESTED."
173 So, he'd somehow found out where we were, and sent that message through the many twists and turns of the 
174 telecommunications world, to end up on that bank's sign.
175 Or else, in desparation, he'd sent it to *ALL* the banks.

211     Annie Stillson sat quietly, silence was the only way to convince her husband of anything when he got like this.
212     Annie opened her eyes for a second, curiosity had gotten the better of her, she wanted to see what effect she was having.
213 
214     Alexei was waiting for this, he knew her little tricks, after all she had been using them for all two years of their short
215 married life. Alexei gave her a knowledgable look.
216 
217     Annie could not stand it anymore, she exclaimed "Where are we going! I demand to know!" She stood and tried another trick,
218 bouncing along with the train. This one was much more new.
219 
220     "I can not tell you, and you know it. So sit down and finish the game. I almost have you in Gammon." Alexei motioned for
221 her to sit back down.
222     "Oh yes you can, and *YOU* know it! The only reason you haven't told me is because you get a very weird pleasure out of
223 teasing me." Point said, Annie sat down, and started to consider a move.
224 
225     "Alright, I admit it. You *DO* get cute when you don't know something you want to, and I could tell you if I wanted to."
226     Alexei decided to wait it out, until she broke down and asked... again.
227 
228     She looked up from the board, and waited a moment and then said loudly "Then where are we going?" Annie was getting her
229 composure back. And was just a little harder to annoy now.
230 
231     "Castiofore Castle, I have a freind there. I received a letter from him three days ago saying he needed some help, and
232 asking if I would come." Alexei waited for Annie to get used to this, and then continued.
233     "We are going to the Castle under the story that we are a freind of the Lord's, in for the wedding.The Lord's daughter is
234 to be married to my freind in three days hence."
235 
236     "Then what trouble is he in, and why exactly is he your freind?" Annie was suspiscious of anyone who could have annoyed
237 her so much.
238 
239     "I met him in medical school, in London. And he thinks that his fiancee is not the same person he proposed to." Alexei had
240 no idea how She was going to respond to this latest tid-bit.
241 
242     "Not his true bride?" Asked Annie, she then continued "Why does he not think so?"
243     "My freind and his original fiancee played a little game. He would ask her if She liked him, and she would say 'Why, yes,
244 I love you.' Five days ago, my freind repeated this game, and his fiancee did not answer with the right response."
245 
246     "Well maybe she forgot, or simply did not wish to play the game. Ladies do get tired of Men you know?" Annie seemed proud.
247     "No, when he asked Her about it, She knew nothing of the game. That is when he started noticing other things. Intimate and
248 otherwise." Alexei shamed Annie to a point where She was either going to have to continue the discussion red-faced or was just
249 going to have to give it up.
250 
251     "Well then, when will we arrive at Castle Castiofore?" A change of subject, Alexei was sorry to have had to embarrass Her
252 like that, but if She persisted in it too long, he might start to wonder about his freind too.

271 I have been pushed into this limelight by a benifactor of unknown call to

273 A name has been chosen, and I will be forced to deal with many. Many will

305 short way down the corridor, down a side branch, to the second door.  Dan
306 noticed as they passed that the doors were not numbered, instead they were
307 marked in an unfamiliar manner, many with quite complex designs.
308   As they entered, Dan noticed his guide trace a small circle on a white

317         Luingil rose from her table and flipped her last coin on the table-
318 a tip for the Innkeeper.  She had spent a lot of her free time in this corner
319 during her vacation, listening to the stories of the travellers and the 
320 locals, storing up small facts and fantasies...she was scheduled for a writing
321 class at the Academie next term, and maybe one of them would help her with an
322 assignment.  
323         She drew her blue cloak about her shoulders, and made sure that the 
324 blue star wouldn't be poking her in the chest.  She filed through the crowd,
325 taking one last, long look at the fabled, famous Backwater Inn before she 
326 went through and closed the doors.  She trudged through the night past the 
327 leafless Rowan Tree, towards the Teleportal to the Osu Academie, and as she 
328 left the circle of light pouring through the windows, she thought on the one 
329 resolution that she would definitely keep this year... to return to the Inn.

385         "Geez I wish I had my car!", I said to myself, while trying not to be
386 overcome with carbon monoxide fumes emanating from the back of the bus. History
387 may someday show us that the invention of the mass-transit bus did more to 
388 hinder the development of civilization than any Wink Martindale game show could
389 ever hope to do.
390         Just then, two uniformed men, who from their swagger sticks and
391 official manner, obviously worked for the bus company, boarded the bus and
392 began checking each unlucky patron for fare inspection.
393         Finally, both made their way to the back of the bus, and me. "Who
394 are you sneering at punk?", demanded one of the little Hitlers. "Ur, are you
395 talking to me?", I replied. Then I realized why I was getting such special
396 attention: I was back in my Billy Idol disguise (I'll never forgive Gaudy
397 for getting me this getup). "Yea, punk.", the other would-be-dictator said.
398 "*WE* are talking to you. Let's see your proof-of-payment. And don't give
399 us any lip!" I have always hated trite idioms, but I complied. No need to
400 get in trouble with the local boys in grey.
401         I seemed to pass their little inspection; my proof-of-payment was
402 in order, so they left me alone. My mind drifted to thoughts of Petrov. The
403 mission had helped me forget a bit of the hatred I held for him, but my
404 vengeance would not be stifled. "Until we meet my dear friend", I laughed to
405 myself.
406         The trail to the apartment building was not hard to follow, thanks
407 to the COMSET links and a never-ending trail of eager snitches, willing to
408 spill their entire life stories for a few dollars American. It's amazing
409 what one can learn from the window of a bus that has to stop every other
410 block to pick up or let off more passengers.
411         The last mile or so I had to walk, but that is to be expected. The
412 city bus routes were obviously planned by throwing numbered darts at a city
413 map, blindfolded. But the bus stop could have been farther away from the
414 destination of the funny looking foreign job and the guy with blood stains;
415 this could have been East county.
416         After spending several minutes following the most probable route
417 of the car (if only NET probability training included dice rolling, maybe
418 I could do better at one of the NET risk parties) I finally spotted the
419 car parked in a lot next to an apartment building. Everything seemed quiet
420 outside, but... Something strange... Call it a sixth sense if you will, but I
421 couldn't shake it. Something big was about to go down. It all seemed to
422 revolve around this apartment building.  
423         I started to make my way towards the apartment building entrance.
424 "This is it," I said to myself, unholstering the new NET issue weapon I had
425 been chosen to test. "I hope Ian knew what he was doing having me field-test
426 this baby..."

435 No entry, just a comment.  It seems everyone is gathering at the apartment, for
436 the great climax of the story.  Perhaps even Farley will show up (and stop
437 playing around the fringes; as far as I'm concerned, you are welcome to join in.)
438 Since Petrov is returning to OSU tomorrow, there is really only time for one
439 more entry from him.  Since the reunion of Joshua & Petrov should be such a
440 dramatic scene, I felt I could not do his character justice on my own, so we
441 decided to collaborate on the entry.  As you can see, there has been no entry
442 for several days.  Which just goes to prove the old sayings about committees.
443 Well, we'll see what happens.

474      Don't expect other people to make your life the way you want it.  They 
475 have their own ideas and wants, and they seldom agree with your veiws of life.  
476 If you wish to live your life the way you want to, you must do it yourself.  
477 No one is going to help you, they are too busy living their own lives. 
478 So resolve as of this day, you will live your own life your own way, and not 
479 be cajoled or otherwise controlled by those who would have you live your life 
480 their way.  They are trying to make the world conform to what they consider is 
481 the proper way of living, but that doesn't mean you have to live that way. 
482 It is your life to live not theirs, and they have no right to force you to 
483 live it their way. 
484 Remember this the next time someone tells you what you MUST do.

489 The Innkeeper lay upon his cot, restlessly tossing and turning. Suddenly 
490 he cries out into the still night air, "No!"  Sitting on the edge of the 
491 cot, the Innkeeper wraps his arms about himself, still shaking at the 
492 intensity of the nightmare. 
493 The Innkeeper had been laying in his cot gazing into the darkened room 
494 trying to find sleep, when a shadow passed over him.  Peering into the 
495 gloom, he could just make out someone standing nearby.  Then he saw a 
496 knife blade in her hand reflecting the weak moonlight seeping through 
497 the curtained window.  The Innkeeper spoke in a none to steady voice, 
498 "Who are you? What do you want?"   When the stranger spoke, he knew who 
499 it was.  "I've come for revenge!"   It did leave the Innkeeper stunned 
500 however, "But why?  I thought you were my friend?  What have I done to 
501 make you feel this way Pam?"   She responed angrily, "Bah! You men are 
502 all alike, no sensitivity at all, you could care less about my feelings, 
503 you only care about your own overinflated ego."    The Innkeeper was 
504 quite shocked at this outburst, "That's just not true, I care very much 
505 about you. I love you!"   At this, Pam just laughs, "You're just saying 
506 that to save your filthy hide!  Enough of this talk!  You're now going 
507 to pay for ruining my life!  I'm not going to let you hurt me again!"   
508 As the knife came down towards his chest, the Innkeeper screamed, "No!"
509 Still shaking, the Innkeeper got up and moved to the window, and pulled 
510 aside the ragged curtain to look out at the rear court of the Inn.  The 
511 moon glinted off of the ice encrusted puddles left by the rain from a 
512 few nights ago, providing an eiry silent world outside.  Knowing that he 
513 was not going to be able to sleep anymore that night, the Innkeeper put 
514 another log in the stove, lighted a lamp, and settled down to read a 
515 book to try to get his mind off of the nightmare.

525 It is much later... The Innkeeper swatted at the stray sunbeam as it 
526 crawled slowly across his face. Then, awaking with a start, he realized 
527 that he had fallen asleep. At least he had been untroubled by fearful 
528 spectors this time. But why should he have such a nightmare as that? He 
529 held no grudge against Pam, and he knew of none that she held against him. 
530 So why the dream? It caused him to tremble just thinking about it.
531 
532 Looking out the window, the Inkeeper saw that the sun had melted the ice 
533 and frost from the grounds, but instead of making things better, it seemed 
534 to leave the landscape look bleak and desolate. The late afternoon sun 
535 lent a brownish gray tinge to it all. Shivering at the ill omen, the 
536 Innkeeper turned back to his sparse room. 
537 
538 A knock at the door. Now what could that be? Opening it, the Innkeeper saw 
539 a messenger boy who silently held out an envelope. Tipping the boy a 
540 copper, the Innkeeper took the letter and opened it. Drat! Another 
541 Christmas dinner? What is this? The holidays are over, must they continue 
542 to obtrude upon me still? And this time mother says she will never forgive 
543 me if I'm late again. Sigh... maybe I can get away in time to get at least 
544 one certain thing done. At least, I hope so.
545 
546 Ah yes, decisions, whether we make the choice to meekly follow the demands 
547 of others, or purposfully go our own way, it is in the end our own 
548 decision. Like it or not, we choose our own destiny. Whether it be by 
549 following the paths of others, or striking out on our own, the choice is 
550 made by you and you alone. Just rememeber that you can always change your 
551 mind, and take another path or forge one anew whenever you wish. 
552 
553 (So why do I relent and go to the dinner when I would rather be doing 
554 something else? Sigh, such is life.)

562   I do not do much here, actually I only lurk. Tho only real interactive thing I ever did was turnig on my terminal.
563   Yeah, all I d, really, is turn on and off my terminal. Sometimes I leave messages though.
564   Yeah, my messages usually say I leave messages. Sometimes I will leave a message that says I never leave messages.
565   I do not do much around here, actually, I only lurk. And that seems to be everything I wanted to say.
566   So I'll see you later, and remember, I only lurk, I never leave messages, and when I do, they say I lurk and never leave any
567 messages.
568   I'll be ambling along now, and I'll see you later, or maybe I wont. Cause I only lurk, I never see people, and when I do see
569 people, I tell 'em I only lurk, and never see people.

576 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (if you read this, DA & Enter something)
577      So it has come to pass that I DO nothing in the late of night. The
578 only thing that happens is the passing of each faded, tired, and lonely
579 hour spent in this chair. For the complete truth to be told, my fingers
580 are the part of me, except for my eyes, that make any attempt at motion-
581 the movement being the only disernable activity to prove that I am even
582 remotely alive. It may even be a prevarication to say that I am even 
583 in an awakened state as my fingures tap gently away in what has become
584 the late early hours of the following morning. Although not alone, mine
585 are the only eyes that are open to such meekness. Having requested to
586 use the entrance to The INN, my numb digits press forward into farther
587 reaches of what may only be a non-remembered dream for the vast majority
588 that will never read such entries as these. I do not mean to be in such
589 a philosophical mood, it is just the way I feel ALL of the time when I
590 am in solitude. The odd thing is, not until I have started to use this
591 extrordinary (sp?) vehicle did I even consider the possibility of altering
592 my simplest thought processes of communication. Let me be the first to 
593 admit in my case that I have been using two and more identities here.
594 Each identity I use, I try to create a differing flare, something to set
595 its' life apart from what may be known as my other selfs. Now I have 
596 found that the 'personalities' I use are becoming more profound, a
597 little bit more filled with a twist of uniqueness.   To you, the
598 Master, Michael Day, I can not thank you enough for weathering that
599 emotional storm and coming out hardened, refreshed, and victorious.
600 I am at loss for words -momentarily- to express the quantities of
601 emotion and revelation you have helped me unlock within myself with 
602 having merely remained open to your public, a public that has grown
603 and shared much with their new friends that may only be recognized by
604 the oddest of symbols used to distinguish one apart from the rest.
605 I am fully aware that because I have chosen this form of communication
606 (bottom of db) you may not receive this message until days have passed
607 and these words are stacked with the other disks that have acumulated 
608 a wealth of onformation- relavent or otherwise.
609 The phrase I use quite frequently when I notice that a new phase is taking
610 over The INN is this- "it looks as if I've jumped on the bandwagon again".
611 It applies once again. A (old & new) friend has informed me that The INN
612 is a lot like what has happened here within the past few weeks. He said,
613 "It is almost always going through changes. It is in a Fantasy state now,
614 but it will change to become full of spy stories later, and will 
615 eventually come back around to being filled with discussions on many
616 diferent philosophies." Yes, that's true. When you have finally read this
617 entry that may only pass like the chill wind, please let me know that you
618 have and if further discussions are permissable.          I have noticed
619 lately that you have once again been struck with the icy feelings of
620 a love, loss, disillusionment(?), and recently, confusion. Your entries
621 may pass some by, but never do they pass by me unnoticed. Prehaps I 
622 care too much for the ones I do not know- and not enough for the ones
623 which I know well... (another bandwagon? maybe not)         I have 
624 been told that I cannot keep blaming what has/has not happened in my past
625 for the things which affect me in the present. Dammit! I only feel that
626 way inrespect to times that others will never understand!
627 woooooops... sorry for that last outbreak, I got carried away- as is the
628 case when I speak of my emtions. (kids will be kids; and e/only will...)
629 I am at an end. *PLEASE* reply, okay?     --->Michael Sondargaard
