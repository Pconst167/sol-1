30 The old woman standing in front of him repeated her
31 question, "Do you want your future read?"
32         "Why, . . . uh, . . . sure, I guess."  It took a
33 while for him to gather his thoughts. "How much will it
34 cost me?"
35         "Well, ducky, my throat's a bit parched . . ." she
36 said, sitting down heavily in the chair across the
37 table from him.  "What say you buy me a pint of bitter
38 first, then we'll see if you like what I read in your
39 hand.  Fair enough?"
40         He couldn't see any obvious scam yet, so, for the
41 price of a pint, he decided to hear her out.  He
42 motioned the bartender over and ordered more ice water
43 for himself and a pint of bitter for the old woman.
44         When their drinks arrived, the old woman eyed his
45 plain water with a scorn and took a deep swallow from
46 her own glass.
47         "Ah," she belched with satisfaction, "that puts a
48 better perspective on the world.  Now, give me your
49 hand, and lets see what old Granny can read."
50         "Who ever she is, she's putting on a good show,"
51 the Philosopher thought. "Might as well play along for
52 a while, it will keep me from worrying so much about
53 this problem I seem to be having with my memory."
54         He extended his hand across the table and she
55 grasped it with a surprisingly strong grip.  She turned
56 it palm up and traced the many lines on it with a none
57 too clean finger.  Muttering under her breath, she
58 studied the tips of his fingers, and the whorls on
59 them.
60         He shifted in his chair, uncomfortable under her
61 close scrutiny.
62         She looked at him from under her brows, "Not much
63 excitement in your life, is there?  The last thing I
64 can see musta been at least a couple months ago.  She
65 musta been something real different for a man like you, with
66 your books and all."  
67         The Philosopher gaped at her with amazement.
68         She chuckled when she saw his expression and looked
69 back down at his hand.  
70         "Looks like you really got a snootful that time.  You gotta get smart about t
71 these things though, build up your tolerance before you
72 drink like that. Otherwise you forget the fun parts and just
73 remember the hangover."

77 Out in the woods the prairie cat paused in its stalking of a rabbit. Had it
78 "heard" it's name? 
79 #Hello?#
80 No response. It scanned carefully. At the edge of its range it felt the two-
81 legs at the Inn. Scanning more carefully, it realized it's error. It had 
82 "heard" a thought directed at a two-legs that was also called "Green Eyes".

89 With the excuse of wanting to take another drink, the crone
90 released the Philosopher's hand.
91         "The fool is still gawping at me like a hooked fish,"
92 she thought.  "Men don't usually forget the dancer," she
93 reflected somewhat bitterly, "and even with my strong hint,
94 this one still isn't remembering."
95         She swallowed more of the ale.  Her feeling of
96 wrongness was now overwhelming.  Could this be some kind of
97 trap with the man across from her being used as the
98 unsuspecting bait?
99         The Inn was starting to fill up with evening regulars. 
100 Soon things would start getting loud and lively, and she
101 could slip out without attracting much attention.   If only
102 she could be sure he wasn't going to remember!
103         The bartender came up to the Philosopher and spoke,
104 somewhat apologetically, "If you'll forgive me for
105 interrupting, sir, I was wondering when you were planning to
106 pay your bill from last time.  If you recall, you ran out of
107 funds after standing the house to a free round."
108         "That's it!" the Philosopher exclaimed.  The bartender
109 took an uncertain step backwards.
110         "There was something I've been trying to remember ever
111 since I got here," the Philosopher hastened to reassure him. 
112 "I've been sitting here racking my brain and coming up with
113 nothing.  Thank you for solving that little mystery.  I'll
114 be happy to pay whatever I owe.  I seem to recall having a
115 great time that night--what I remember of it."
116         The crone, seeing this as her last chance to jog his
117 memory, directed a question at the bartender.
118         "Wasn't that around the time that that dancer showed up
119 and put on a real performance?"
120         "I believe it was . . . yes, I'm sure of it.   Don't
121 you remember, sir, at the end how she was leaping from table
122 to table and everybody was clapping."
123         Looking rueful, the Philosopher shook his head.  "For a
124 while that night I was . . . uh . . . involved in porcelain
125 worship and I . . . well . . . fell asleep in the
126 confessional.  When I came back everyone was raving about
127 her, but I never did see her."
128         For a moment the crone sat stunned, but she quickly
129 recovered.  "This was a trap!  I have to get out of here
130 immediately!" she thought.
131         "Well," she said, rising from her chair, "while you
132 gentlemen finish your business, I'll take a little trip to
133 the necessary.  You can't buy beer, you know.  You can only
134 rent it."
135         Chuckling at her own jest, the crone make her way
136 through the crowd and out the door.  Once outside she
137 lengthened her stride and headed toward the pond as fast as
138 her old body would allow, hoping desperately that no one was
139 following her.

145 All you listening to me this day who have a technological background, try to
146 imagine: You are in... the Middle Ages, perhaps before, and you have to build
147 an automobile.  
148 Now multiply the difficulty by a factor of five.
149 Yob's people had beautiful art, but when it came to manipulating their
150 environment, they ranked about at the level of a long-lost African tribe.
151 Yob had to ask me what a catapult was.
152 I may make the problem sound more difficult than it was.  The people of All
153 were much more intelligent, on the average, than the people of Earth or Celene.
154 After some struggle in trying to determine where to begin my instruction about
155 primitive engineering, the project ran much more smoothly than I would have 
156 guessed.  They were skilled with their hands, and once a few things were
157 explained to them, the tools they needed to complete the project began to form
158 beneath their hands.  My own grew calloused.
159 After a time:
160 "It is beautiful, Yob.  The village can be proud of their accomplishment."
161 "It is also strange and wonderous to us, Erhuman.  I would like to visit these
162 lands that make such things.  Their knowledge is great."
163 I considered that.  "They do not know nearly as much as the tribe in other
164 things, Yob.  One day I shall return and show you those lands.  You may teach
165 each other."
166 "Are you ready to use the kaatuhpuhlt now?"
167 I sighed.  The work had taken its toll, and the going would soon be rough.
168 "Not yet, Yob.  Sunset tomorrow, I shall depart.  And return with something
169 for the tribe, I will."  I noted that my speech patterns were becoming
170 a bit permuted, they were.
171 "Then rest.  Your things will be gathered.  Be certain to bring my greetings
172 to this other place...."

177 In a partially filled storeroom in the upper reaches of the
178 Inn, hidden behind a tier of boxes, lay the body of a man. 
179 His fingers twitched slightly with the return of sensation
180 and neural activity.  His awareness struggled against the
181 numbness of his prolonged trance state.  The ward spell's
182 summons was still the only coherent thought in his mind. 
183 But it was enough.  The Magus was soon intoning the words
184 which would counter the detrimental effects of what must
185 have been a much longer sleep than he had foreseen having.
186         He cursed at himself for having attuned his ward spell
187 for only the return of the Philosopher; and for blithely
188 assuming that that return would occur within days of the
189 dancer's appearance.
190         As he worked and massaged his deadened limbs, he
191 wondered just how long he had lain, gathering dust, in the
192 dark room . . . three weeks? a month? two months?
193         And during this time what had she, his quarry, his
194 prey, done?  Had she waited?  Or had she found some traveler
195 other than the Philosopher to take her another step away
196 from him in this deadly chase?
197         It was more than an hour from the time of his summoning
198 till the Magus was able to walk steadily down the corridor
199 to the stairs and make his descent to the public room below.
200         As the room came into view, he quickly scanned the
201 crowd to find the Philosopher and, he hoped, the shape-
202 changer.  He knew he would have no trouble recognizing the
203 Philosopher--after all, he had worn a glamour of that very
204 person the night he had made the false promise of escape to
205 the dancer.
206         "Did she ever discover that little switch?" the Magus
207 wondered with grim humor.
208         He spotted the Philosopher at a small table in the
209 back.  He worked his way slowly through the press of bodies
210 and approached the table.
211         "Do you mind if I share your table?" he asked the
212 Philosopher.  "It's getting too noisy for me up front."
213         "Go right ahead," said the Philosopher.  "I have a
214 feeling my Fortune Teller isn't coming back."
215         "Fortune Teller?" the Magus looked at the Philosopher
216 with interest, as he sat in the empty chair.  "Was she any
217 good?  Or was it the usual jumble of generalities that could
218 fit anybody?"
219         "I never found out." said the Philosopher.  "She talked
220 more about my past than my future, and was only half right
221 with that.  She certainly was a strange old girl."
222         "Old," queried the Magus, his interest suddenly
223 serious.  "How old, 40's or 50's?"
224         "Oh no, much closer to 80 than 40."
225         Sensing that the Philosopher was becoming curious about
226 his increased interest, the Magus abruptly changed the
227 subject to a seemingly unrelated topic.
228         "I'm a stranger to this region," he began.  "Could you
229 tell me if there are any good, deep fishing streams or ponds
230 nearby?  I'd like to catch a big one if I could."
231         "No," said the Philosopher.  "I'm not much of an
232 outdoorsman.  But some of the locals in here tonight could
233 tell you.  Just ask around."
234         "Thanks," said the Magus, getting up out of his chair. 
235 "I think I'll wander around and do just that."
236 
237 Green Eyes (02-28-87)
238 P.S.  I would like to thank the Philosopher for not
239 objecting to my rather free-handed use of his character.  I
240 hope he suffers no harm from my tampering.

243 I was sitting at my usual table, reading and sipping my B&B, when an odd 
244 character approached me and asked if I was a fisherman. 
245 "Only for lost ideas," I replied.  "What is it that you are looking for. 
246 I may be able to help, as I have heard every fishing story imagineable, from
247 my comfortable spot here in the warmth."
248 "There is a pond, not far from here, that holds an enormous bass.  It can 
249 never be caught, though, because if it were, the level of the pond would drop 
250 so much that all the little fishes would be left high and dry."  I chuckled
251 at the thought picture that evoked, and the stranger grabbed my shoulder
252 rather harshly.
253 "A pond ?  Where ?  What direction ?  How far ?" he cried.
254 "Over that way, not far.  Ouch!  Follow the stream."
255 #How rude, he didn't even laugh at my story.#  I turned and watched him rush
256 for the door.  I picked my book up and began reading again, where I left 
257 off.  Bach is such a wonderful writer.

291 The Magus paused just outside the doorway of the Inn to
292 orient himself.  The directions he had gotten were vague,
293 in keeping with the person giving them--who had appeared to
294 be reading the bound score of "The Well-Tempered Clavier". 
295 He was not one to 'examine the dental cavities of a steed
296 received for no compensation given.'  Vague people have
297 their uses, he thought with malicious satisfaction.
298         He set off in what he thought was the right direction.
299         If his estimate of the length of her lead was correct,
300 the shape-changer would only now be preparing herself for
301 the transformation ritual.  He had never seen one of her
302 kind performing the rite.  Though he had read everything he
303 could find about these rare creatures, it was difficult to
304 separate the facts from the wealth of legend and myth
305 surrounding them.  But he did know that the time just prior
306 to transformation was when they were most vulnerable,
307 perhaps even helpless.  
308         If only he could catch her before she entered the
309 water, while she was focusing all of her attention inward,
310 then he knew he could capture her and make her his slave,
311 his most obedient servant.  Having her in his power was the
312 key to his dreams of power, his empire.  But first, she had
313 to be caught.  
314         He increased his speed until he was running swiftly and
315 quietly over the ground, his shadow like a stooping falcon.

360 The Philosopher put down his flagon and looked about him. 
361 It had been a strange evening so far.  First the fortune
362 teller then a rather annoyed looking magician who wanted to
363 know where to find a good fishing spot had come to his table
364 only to leave again rather quickly.  He wondered why the
365 fortune teller had left so abruptly and why the magician had
366 been so intent on finding fish.  "There could be some
367 connection," he thought, "but I'm not at all sure what it
368 might be.  Perhaps the Bard or ARoNov could help me."  But
369 he could see neither ARoNov nor the Bard.  Disappointed, he
370 pulled a small jeweled medallion from his robe and held it
371 in his left hand.  He closed his eyes and cast a though
372 across the Inn.  #Bard, ARoNov, where are you?#

391 Davis: Actually, in the  way things have been lately, perhaps you should
392 be decrying the lack of input here rather than Green Eye's input.
393 I cannot complain of excessive use of the system when he is the only
394 one adding much to the system in the last few days. The main reason 
395 that the entries are as they are is due to the lack of other input
396 between his entires. How about it people, where are you?

398 SERVING THE NATIONS OF EURASIA FOR TWENTY YEARS

400 Her fingers went through her short hair and left no trace. Looks were
401 important to her only twenty minues after their encounter. No doubt she had
402 no time to worry about it during the chase. Now she wanted to use a compact
403 mirror and she did. Pasha tried to look around the mirror in order to see
404 her. He failed but at least she could not have noticed he had. It only took a
405 few minutes for their waitress to come back.
406  
407 Nat folded up the compact and clasped it into place. It was in her purse by
408 the time the waitress was ready to set her coffee down on the table. For a
409 waitress, her hands shook a great deal. It must have been age, decided Pasha,
410 noticing the liver spots on her hands and her wrinkled neck. Her head was
411 stretched out to pour the coffee, her neck was hanging over his place setting
412 in fact. He could see the red marks from having her neck held. Held tight.
413  
414 Pasha tried not to show his fear. Nat was picking out a black cartridge from
415 her purse and was about to show it when the waitress took the pitcher of
416 coffee to another table. He had waited for the aging waitress to leave
417 to another table before he told Nat not to drink or eat.
418  
419 She was surprised. Frustration tinged her voice as she posed a question about
420 why she should not. Marks on the neck of the waitress convinced her to
421 abstain for a while. It also kept her eyes open, despite her fatigue. It was
422 not the time to show either fright or weariness.
423  
424 Each imagined they saw other diners watching them not drinking. Each knew
425 intellectually that it could not have been a diner who had assaulted the
426 waitress that way. It was a person behind the counter or in the kitchen.
427 Pouring cups of cream had never been so tough before.
428  
429 Nat held up her mug to set it to her lips when Pasha told her not to actually
430 touch the steaming liquid. Her tone fit the manner she was holding the cup
431 with. It was as if they should be discussing a progressive media of one sort
432 or another. They considered what to do about the possible poison, or their
433 possible paranoia, and they evetually decided to try to duck out the front
434 doors and run for his car.
435  
436 Nat put a large bill on the table and stood up very quickly. Pasha followed
437 her out the front door in a huff. Neither one could be sure the motion they
438 saw in the corner of their eyes was not the falling scenery of the diner as
439 they rose. He led her to his car several streets down. Pauses for traffic
440 gave them time to catch breath while they held their breath as the passed the
441 strangers of the New York streets.
442  
443 They made it to his car. Pasha got in and reached over to open the passenger.
444 The right click and Nat tried the door handle. The car was short and she
445 nearly tore her skirt and scraped her nylons in sitting down to the level of
446 the seat. Pasha turned the key a few times. When it started, they pulled out
447 slow and drove fast. They ended up parking in Upstate New York and that is
448 when she showed him the cartridge again.
449                                                              LET LIBERTY RING

451 WELL, NOW THAT DIGITAL RESEARCH WENT BELLY-UP A WHILE AGO, PEOPLE (AMAZINGLY

452 ENOUGH, ARE STILL USING CP/M SYSTEMS (ME BEING ONE OF THEM). KAYPROS, MORROWS
453 AND A WHOLE SLEW OF CP/M EMULATORS/Z80 CPU BOARDS FOR ATARI 520ST'S, IBM'S,
454 APPLES, AND A FEW OTHER BIG NAMES, ETC.
455 		NOW FOR THE QUESTION...
456 IS ANYBODY OUT THERE INTERESTED IN THE Z80 CPU OR CP/M THAT I CAN YACK WITH?
457 I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING IN UNDOCUMENTED Z80 OPCODES (AS VARIED AND NUMEROUS
458 AS FLIES IN A DESERT) AND SOME OTHER THINGS.
459 I AM STILL TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT DD76 DOES.
460 I HAVE COUNTED ABOUT 400+ NEW MNEMONICS AND HAVE TRACKED DOWN ABOUT 60.
461 MIKE DAY, ARE YOU LISTENING?
462 ALSO, THE Z800 SERIES MPU'S ARE MAKING A COMEBACK. ZILOG IS REANNOUNCING
463 THIS SERIES AGAIN, NOW THAT THE BUGS ARE REMOVED.
464 THE MINIMUM CLOCK SPEED IS 10 MHZ & THE MAXIMUM IS 25MHZ.
465 THE DATA & ADDRESS BUSSES ARE MULTIPLEXED.
466 DATA BUSSES CAN BE 8 OR 116 BITS WIDE, ADDRESS LINES CAN BE 18 OR 24 BITS
467 WIDE (YOUR CHOICE).
468 IT HAS A BUILT-IN MMU, PARALLEL AND SERIAL PORTS, COUNTER-TIMER CIRCUITS
469 AND A 256-BYTE INSTRUCTION CACHE THAT SUPPORTS READING INSTRUCTIONS FROM
470 DRAMS IN BURST MODE, ETC.
471 THIS IS NOT A JOKE. IT RUNS THE CURRENT Z80 OPCODES, AND IT HAS A FEW
472 MORE, TOO. THE MNEMONICS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO LOOK MORE 68000'ISH.
473 NICE NEW INSTRUCTIONS LIKE TRAP, MULTIPLY/DIVIDE SIGNED/UNSIGNED, ETC.
474 HAVE BEEN ADDED. THE Z8216 DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE ZILOG FLOATING POINT
475 PROCESSOR BECAUSE OF THE 16-BIT DATA BUS.
476 I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS CHIP FLYING ABOUT.
477 -----------------------
478 MIKE DAY, I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A NICE CHANGE OF 2708'S FOR MY DISK WRITER.
479 YOU SAID TO ASK FOR HELP. I'M ASKING.
480 DO YOU STILL HAVE THE DISK WRITER?

488 Green Eyes: great stuff! I had thought the shape-changer was a bad guy (girl?)
489 and the Magus was a good guy but it seems the opposite is true. Whichever
490 it is, I'm interested in seeing more. I love stories involving the Inn, and
491 wish there was more of them.
492 
493 Davis: You know, there are other systems around Portland. Why don't you give
494 some of them a try? Maybe if we're real lucky you'll get lost on the way
495 back and we won't have to listen to you. Personally, I'd rather listen to
496 Green Eyes any day, multiple entries and all.

500 Sorry, didn't mean to play monopoly--the creative juices
501 just started flowing.  I'll try to hold back after this.
502 CISTOP MIKEY:  he(?), I'm a she.

504 The crone leaned against the smooth bark of the willow tree,
505 gasping in an effort to regain her breath.  She pressed her
506 hand against her side to ease a painful stitch.  She had
507 pushed the old body nearly beyond its limits in her race to
508 reach the pond, so she should expect to pay some price for
509 the speed.
510         She could see a glint of moonlit water through the
511 drooping branches of the willow.  Very soon she would have
512 to prepare for transformation, but for now she could only
513 pant, and try to compose her mind.  A calm mind was
514 necessary to induce the trance-state of transformation, and
515 she was far from feeling calm.  How close on her heels was
516 her pursuer?  She had no doubt that he would quickly find
517 out what bodies of water were close to the Inn.  
518         How much of a head start did she have, how long could
519 she rest?  And where could she escape to?  That was the most
520 disturbing question of all.
521         The only worlds open to her were ones she could reach
522 through the water memory--once her body had changed in a
523 body of water, she could always return to that water during
524 a subsequent transformation.  But in order to go to new
525 worlds, she first had to be taken there by another traveler. 
526 This was why she had sought out the Philosopher, and then
527 waited so patiently for his return.  He had promised to take
528 her to one of his worlds, somewhere out of the knowledge and
529 reach of her pursuer.  And now that escape route no longer
530 existed, because the Philosopher didn't even remember
531 meeting the dancer, let alone his promise to provide her
532 with transport to another world.
533         She desperately tried for formulate a destination, and
534 decide which of her shapes would be most useful when she
535 reached it.

540    The Romans would parade their captured goods through the streets of Rome.
541 New slaves, the peoples of the conquered lands, walked along with the
542 procession. Romans stood along the streets and gazed upon the bounty of the
543 conquests, both human and material.
544    It was a time of revelling. The wars on all fronts were in favor of the
545 expanding Roman quest for power. The armies could do no wrong.
546    One particular Roman rode along on his chariot. Instead of horses, moor
547 slaves pulled the ornate vehicle through the streets. He glanced across the
548 eight sweaty backs of free men enslaved pulling him to greater riches.
549 Another moor walked beside the chariot, waving a large fan to keep the
550 Conqueror cool in the Mediterranean sun. The moor, a tribal leader in his
551 own land, looked up at the Roman, aglitter in ceremonial dress. The 
552 conquerors and the conquered side by side. The moor spoke, in his own 
553 tongue, loud enough for the Roman to hear.
554    "All glory is fleeting."
555    He knew the Roman would never understand.

563 Someone asked where did people go, now that PC&S is gone? I answer you,
564 P.C.S. The Portland Computer Society has a pizza social every month. The
565 day is the first Thursday of the month. The starting time is 7:00pm-7:30pm.
566 The place is Stark Street Pizza Co. You are in luck, since this coming
567 Thursday happens to be the first Thursday of March. PC&S -> P.C.S. deja vu?

571 If, instead, you were referring to the PC & S Tavern that used to exist near
572 the Multnomah Country Library, where PorSFiS and Innhabitants used to lurk
573 on alternate Saturdays, the substitute nowadays is "The Back Street Pub"
574 (as it reads in my copy of the Pulsar), and the next meeting of PorSFiS is at
575 2:00pm on March 7.  I'm afraid that Innhabitants lurk there much less often
576 than in the days of PC&S.  You'd have better luck going to the PCS Social
577 on March 5th, additional data in message above.

579 "NOW!" I yelled down.
580 Yob cut the rope with his stone knife, releasing the energy stored within
581 the catapult.  My body was pressed violently forward and upward...
582 Sunset.  Magic was possible.
583 The words were said, the motions made, and I prayed to whatever benevolent
584 beings there may be in the multiverse that I had judged the speed and angle
585 properly.  Very soon I'd know.
586 I threw my ebony wand before me, letting it cut a path through the ether to
587 somewhere else.
588 My view of All was breathtaking.  My body sailed high above Yob's village,
589 above the valley.  I saw the village people wave farewell-
590 Dark enveloped me;  I had passed through a familiar-looking circular portal
591 which already was closing behind me.  All quickly repaired its wound.
592 Direction seemed to have no meaning here, but I felt motion.  I looked in what
593 must have been "forward".  The wand was still there, now shining bright,
594 cleaving a route between sphere and sphere.
595 A very large problem when firing a cannon (or, as at present, a catapult) is
596 determining where the shot will land.  Okay, fine.  Now, how about a 
597 *multi-dimensional* shot?  Very, very tricky.  Especially if you're the ammo.
598 Using all of my skill, I attempted to direct my "motion".  The resistance was
599 great; I seemed to be destined to finish the parabola I had begun.  I believe
600 I suceeded in directing my landing to the correct dimension, but perhaps luck
601 had more to do with it.  At any rate,  I felt myself falling-
602 -a window opened before me-
603 -into a river.
