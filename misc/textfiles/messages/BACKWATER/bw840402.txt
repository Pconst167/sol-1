70      hello!     just popped in for for a quick look about.....
71 
72  how bouts a little teeny-weeny discussion/debate/name-calling match? say,
73 firearm control? ( do I hear 2 sets of muffled chuckles in the background?
74   it WAS the only thing left, right?) I'll take round 1.
75 
76 1) All firearms should be removed from the public sector.
77                                          (here comes the sharps commitee...)

81 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
82 Aaron -- sure!  Here's round two:
83 2)  Every person should be required to complete a firearms safety course and
84 fire a qualifying score at a target range before recieving a high-school
85 diploma.  Use and maintanance of firearms should be required just as other
86 survival skills such as mathematics and english.  No restriction should be
87 placed on purchase and ownership of firearms.

103 With all the trouble in the world, I think that we would all be a lot
104 safer if there were much stricter controls on guns. I'm not saying
105 that we should get rid of guns, just that  we should be more careful. the
106 safty course should be manditory for any who buy or use guns, and those
107 who live in the vicinity of those who do.
108 
109 I missed who said it, but the radio just had a report about some interesting
110 views. some polititian said that it was the duty of the old to die to
111 make room. He also said drugs that allow terminally ill people to 
112 live longer was wrong. I'm not kidding. Although I didn't catch his
113 name, I did hear that he was Democrat. 
114     It's hard to believe that it's sick minds like this that run our lives
115 through the government..
116 WAIT! I just found it on the front page of the oregonian. It was
117 Colorado gov. Richard Lamm.  The article is more disgusting than the 
118 radio report. There's one politian who probably just talked himself
119 out of re-election.

124   I feel there are enough laws restricting firearms......The easier way
125 to insure ( at least with the least trouble ) a safer future 
126 would be  Control the amunition that is available to the public.
127 
128    Just a thought ,
129 :::::::::::::::::::::::Alex::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
130 The cat shook its head. Where had THAT thought come from? He knew
131 the horse clans and their two-leg friends, but what was a "novel"?
132 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Green Eyes""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
133 Alex: If you are referring to that law that some groups are trying to push 
134 thru Congress, let me fill you in on a few details the media seems reluctant
135 to mention.
136 1. The teflon bullets are no longer being made.
137 2. Many police organizations (not necessarily departments) don't support it.
138 3. The way the law is written, MOST hunting ammo would be outlawed. (there
139    are a lot of specialty pistols that will handle rifle ammo)
140 
141 I don't have time to dig up references for all of the above. If
142 anyone has DOCUMENTED evidence supporting OR countering the above, feel
143 free. (I can't remember which organizations for #2, but I believe it was
144 something like the FBI & the National Association of Police Chiefs)
145 On the gun safety bit, you will have to teach EVERYONE because
146 guns are a LOT more common than is generally realized. Remember, if it
147 looks like a gun - treat it as real until proven otherwise. A gun is
148 ALWAYS assumed to be loaded. Don't point a gun at anything you don't intend 
149 to KILL (wounding is MUCH more difficult!). There, did I miss any?

152 How about this: every American citizen is required to complete a gun-
153 safety course to qualify for full adult rights (i.e. voting, driving,
154 drinking), after which they are REQUIRED to carry a functioning firearm
155 (loaded[the gun, not the user]) whenever in a public place. I also 
156 propose that death from shooting could then be placed in the "natural
157 causes" category, thereby freeing up our court dockets and helping
158 reduce the overcrowding in our prisons. The lack of concern we show for
159 the hideous rate of death on our highways indicates to me that if every-
160 one carried a gun then people would accept shooting deaths as the price
161 we pay for preserving our way of life.

163 The Poet settled into his  seat in the inn with a sigh. It was good to
164 be back. He was just adding his comment to a discussion of weapons 
165 control, with his usual flair for the bizarre, when the Inn door opened
166 and a robed man stepped inside. The Newcomer's face was hard to make out,
167 but something about him seemed to upset the adventurer.
168 "Excuse me," he told his companions, "Ifeel a sudden call of nature." 
169 With this, he all but flew into the Roman bath that served as the Inn's
170 restroom.
171 "Innkeeper, seven ales!"
172 Every eye in the adventuring party turned to the newcomer. That voice...
173 those words... this was the Poet! The Innkeeper was the first to shake 
174 off his confusion and speak.
175 "I don't understand, are there two of you?"
176 "Odd that you should ask. There is of course only one of me, but I do 
177 have a twin brother. I haven't seen him for years; the family disowned
178 him for his criminal activities. Last I heard of him he was running an
179 import-export business in a 47th-century reality, although rumor has it
180 that he is involved in selling weapons to various unsavory groups."
181 An explosion was heard form the restroom. The entire room rushed to 
182 investigate, and found that one of the marble walls of the bath had been
183 removed, and the words "Gaius Was Here" burned into one of those that
184 remained.
185 "That's his handwriting, alright," said the Poet. "I hope none of you 
186 loaned him any money."

194 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
195 So now we discuss the issue of firearms control!! Well if we must, we must.
196 Here's the way ever person in the good ole U.S. of A should look at it:
197  1. The U.S. was founded with the lives and gun powder of many brave and
198     desperate people. They had been paying up to a king across an ocean
199     and were seeing none of the benefit. In writing the Constitution it
200     was obvious to them that a people should have the right and ability
201     to defend not only themselves, but also their country.
202 2.  The countries who have fallen before the mighty Russian bear have
203     all been nations that, in part or whole, possesed not enough weapons
204     to fight their way out of a street brawl.  To wit: Poland, as just
205     one example, did not have even the basic peice of pipe to as their
206     defense. In essence, the big, bad bear just waltzed in and said
207     Thanks!
208 3.  The only a rifle or hand weapon EVER kills some person is when it is
209     accidently discharged in the direction of some unfortunate soul or
210     it's trigger is squeezed by someone. The key here, as with all man
211     made devices, is that it requires HUMAN input.
212 4.  To control these devices  would be nigh on impossible because there
213     are a number of people who not have several firearms in their house-
214     hold a number of people who not only posses several firearms but also
215     have the knowledge and ability to reload their own ammunition!!
216                                                                       I
217     have met some of these folk and they are, I assure you, neither the
218     stereotyped bloodluster nor the paranoid. They are practical people.
219     
220 The one suggestion that really rings true is the idea of education in the
221 handling and use of firearms. Ignorance is no excuse! Neither is the idea
222 of total abolishment. Rather, we must try and obtain both a degree of yhe
223 [C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C
224       control some people are determined to shove on the rest of us and the
225 ability to go out and realise one of the basic rights as guarenteed by
226 our Constitution.

249 THE SHOOTING OF FIREARMS IS A SPORT NOT ONLY AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE

252 IN FRIENDLY COMPETITION. I FULLY BELIEVE IN GUN SAFETY AND AWARENESS, 
253 BUT ALSO BELIEVE THAT EXESSIVE LAWS AND RED TAPE COULD SERIOUSLY HURT

262 I think that we are forgeting something here.if we arm everybody then the
263 maniacs with less then there alloted amount of brain power would go and 
264 start killing.i.e.;
265 "my dad is bigger"
266 "no,MY dad is Bigger"
267 "well my daddys gun is bigger"
268 "well I have my daddys gun!"
269 (blam,boom(sound of crying))
270 and we have another front pager for the masses.
271 this also applys to the high school crowd,i.e.;
272 "you turned me in for selling drugs,duidn't you?"
273 "no,no,I didn't please..."
274 (blam,thunk(hystarical screems from onlookers))
275 my law is;when a person can show that they are mentaly stable,they can carry
276 a gun,persons in public schools should not have guns no matter what.I can 
277 think of many times in high school when a gun would have gotten me into prob
278 lems,ie shooting people.

303    Ahh yes, guns.. I am reminded of an article I read in the 
304 World Press Review on that very issue. It was written by a 
305 Frenchman who was saying how crazy we Americans were to be
306 so lenient with allowing our citizens to have guns. Feeling
307 that we should only allow authorized persons to carry arms.
308 A nice thought, but it doesn't seem to make much difference
309 in reality. It would stop some stupid killings since it would
310 take the guns out of the hands of those who have no idea how
311 to use them to begin with. But as far as the criminal types,
312 it won't make any difference at all. Oh it might rise the
313 price of the gun a bit, but not that much, and certainly not 
314 enough to make any difference to someone who wants a gun and
315 knows how to get one. They will still be quite readily available
316 even if they are outlawed altogether. A gun is just far to easy
317 an item to make. And don't forget the enormous volume of guns 
318 that are already out there, even an attempt to recapture all of 
319 them would not get very far (assuming that sort of thing could 
320 even be done). They would simply be hidden away and since there 
321 is no records of them, who can say they exist to begin with?
322 Want a look at an outlawed commodity that exists anyway because 
323 people want it? Take a look at the underground drug industry. 
324 It's a billion dollar business, and it certainly isn't rolling 
325 over and playing dead just because it is illegal. And it isn't 
326 just criminals involved, it is everyday normal people that 
327 support that industry. 
328 Probalbly an even closer association would be the prohibition 
329 era, as it more closly matches the feelings involved with the gun 
330 issue. It hardly made any difference there, it just sent it 
331 underground and made problems even worse. At least when it is 
332 above ground, you can control it if you work at it. 
333 In listening to various people talk about their activities and 
334 stories about guns, I have found that there are 3 basic reasons 
335 for having a gun, 1. to kill someone 2. for sport 3. for defense
336 of those, there isn't a whole lot you can do about number one, 
337 number 2 is not a problem. It is number 3 that seems to cause the 
338 big noise that the media likes to write about. Typically the 
339 person has had no training in the use of a gun at all, and have 
340 no idea what they are doing. Killings by these people either 
341 occur as a fit of passion, or out of pure stupidity. Such as 
342 killing or wounding oneself or another while cleaning or 
343 otherwise handling a gun. Another circumstance that really has
344 no need is using the gun to kill or wound someone who is 
345 encroaching upon your teritory. First, often the gun wasn't 
346 needed in the first place, next simply bradishing the gun and 
347 letting the offending person know of its existance will usually 
348 do the trick, and finally firing a warning shot will usually do 
349 the trick if all else fails. But to go for the kill right off is 
350 a bit stupid. As far as laws, there are so many now that aren't 
351 being enforced, I doubt that any more would have any real impact.
352 But back to the French person, his feelings are far from 
353 abnormal, many people in France and in other europeon countries 
354 feel that way. Yet France sees nothing wrong with selling nuclear 
355 plants to counties knowing full well that they will be used to 
356 make plutonium and other materials for war weapons. 
357 So really, when we get down to it it is really simply a matter of 
358 perspective and what you personally feel is important, but don't 
359 expect everyone else to feel te same way.
360 As for myself, yes i have been trained in how to handle a gun, 
361 being in the service, you don't get much choice. On a good day I 
362 can hit the broad side of a barn if I'm lucky. I do feel that a 
363 person must be able to prove his ability to handle a gun before 
364 being allowed to own one. I myself get no enjoyment from shooting 
365 a gun. In conclusion, no I don't care for guns, but neither do I 
366 see anything being helped by outlawing them. I would rather see 
367 the effort being spent on getting drunk drivers off the road, it 
368 is a far far greater killer of inocent people then guns. And it 
369 is condoned far more then guns are. st take a look at the number 
370 of court cases involved by those getting off easily for killing 
371 someone with a car compared to killing someone with a gun. 
372 Killing with a car is always more lenient, yet the person is just 
373 as dead. Enough already!

376 How sad but true the above statement is.  No matter how the person was
377 killed, that's one less soul to keep us company, and the world is 
378 already too lonely of a place.
379      Personally, I have had no training in the use of firearms, but if 
380 I were to want to use one, I would not pick it up without having some
381 kind of formal training. At this time I would not want it so I don't get
382 it.  
383      As far as use in sports, although I do not participate in any
384 sports (outside pinball and occasional vollyball), I feel one sport
385 I could enjoy if I had the time would be the biathalon (combination of
386 cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship).
387      I guess it all comes down to one statement, guns don't kill people,
388 PEOPLE do.

404 Just fixed the backspace. I had been talking to a Honeywell(the bad taste!)
405 just a sec...there...all set now...Thanks for the info, someone will call
406 US Digital in the near future...
407 REGARDING THE GUN CONTROL ISSUE: I personally have mixed feelings about the
408 whole thing. I had formal training in firearms a few years ago, and own
409 7 guns. But I don't really care to hunt, at least not any more, when a large
410 number of your fellow hunters are beer guzzling poachers who would gladly
411 put a 30 ought 6 into anything that moved, be it 4 point buck or human
412 wearing proper orange attire. I really enjoy target practice, and harmless
413 plinking with a .22. I don't keep ammunition around the house, and buy it
414 only when I am going out to shoot. I also have good friends, like retired
415 police officers and the like, who are also quite knowledgable about guns, 
416 and keep loaded guns in the house, and they are some of the most rational
417 reasonable people I know. Our basic right to keep arms is one of our most
418 important basic rights:it was important when it was written, and it is 
419 important today. I am not so sure the fact that people are armed is going to
420 keep a foreign power from 'invading', hand guns do very little against 
421 Mig 25's and tacticle nuclear weapons, but I might make that other nation
422 think twice before sending troops into a country like the troops that were
423 sent into afganistan. I guess my basic belief, like many others on the
424 system, is that we should spend more time doing something about things
425 like hunger(so Ed Meese), education, and death on the roads, which by
426 the way has killed far more people than all the wars the US has been involve
427 d in have caused.
428 I on the other hand must agree with Aaron. Rampant use of lasers, no matter
429 how 'small', must be nipped in the bud. There is no telling when the first
430 big incident of someone being killed while cleaning their ruby or something
431 is going to be the front page story. Why some unsuspecting sole walking
432 down the street may be a victim, and not even know what hit'im!

436 Pheric......I was just curious about your interest in BOC. It is not common
437 to find another person in our little electronic world who even has heard of
438 them!

444 A thought occurs to me (Yes! Really!).  Pam has mentioned a couple of
445 times recently on Bit Bucket that she's going to get back on BW any
446 day now.  Now consider-how many stories have been on here with the
447 search for Pam as a primary or secondary objective?  The infamous Pm
448 has been built up to the point where, if I was her, I wouldn't want to 
449 make an appearance here because the only possible responce is 
450 anticlimactic. (well, I suppose it's possible that she Could live
451 up to her reputation,  but then why isn't she nationally syndicated?)
452 Don't get me wrong.  I'm not putting her down. I'm just saying that
453 if I had a build-up like that, I'd be a bit apprehensive about meeting
454 expectations.
455 Just a thought.

462 Aaron -- sorry about that, I just wanted to take the other side!  Would you
463 like some support for your position?  (I REALLY didn't think that BWMS was a
464 hotbed of closet gun supporters.)  Let me just step away from the screen and
465 lock something up.  (various ,mmetallic clincs, sounds of objects being moved,
466 scrape of a key in a lock) There, let's see what can be said in defense of
467 your position.
468   1)  Firearms are inherently dangerous.  They are, first and foremost WEAPONS
469   designed to propell a projectile into and kill something.  If killing is 
470 morally wrong, owning the means of killing is morally wrong.  Handguns are 
471 designed to kill PEOPLE.  If killing people is wrong, then owning a means to do
472 so must also be wrong.
473   2)   Firearms are dangerous to handle.  Many untrained and ignorant people
474   are damaged or wounded each year through carelessness or outright stupidity.
475   It's much like child-proofing a house.  Take all the dangerous breakables away
476   and they can't do as much damage to themselves and those around them.
477   3)  America is a culture of violence.  With the means at hand of carrying out 
478  violent action, the temptation can often become overwhelming.  Studies have 
479   shown that persons who watch violence on TV or movies are subsequently MUCH
480   more prone to violent behaviour.  If a person watches more than 1 hour of TV
481  a week, or 1 movie within three weeks, his or her responses are tainted with
482  violence and their judgement is suspect.  Indeed, much of American society 
483  could be called insane, if the majority did not share the same non-sane 
484  set of reactions.  It seems only natural to remove firearms from the eassy reach
485  of non-sane persons.  (I wish it were just as easy to get the bombs out of the
486 hands of the boys in the pentagon whose hobby is mass murder.)

488 With a smile, the piper set the pipes upon his shoulder and began to play a
489 reel, "The Merry Harriers."
490 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
491 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
492 PIPER: THIS SOCIETY SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE INTERESTING. DOES THE L OR 5
493 STAND FOR SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR?
494 MIKEY: PERHAPS I TOOK YOU FOR SOMEONE ELSE.....BUT I THOUGHT YOU HAD 
495 BRIEFLY CRITICIZED A RACIAL BLURB ON AN EARLIER DISK, AND I WAS JUST A-
496 GREEING WITH YOU OR WHOEVER. BY THE WAY, HOW ARE THE BUSHES IN YOUR
497 AREA FARING AS OF LATE?
498 
499 ON THE GUN THING........I CAN SEE WHERE GUNS COULD BE OKAY, IN SOME AREAS
500 ESPECIALLY WHERE PEOPLE MUST DEPEND ON THEM FOR FOOD. MANY PEOPLE USE THIS
501 EXCUSE THO FOR A ROMP IN THE WOODS, ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR BEST FRIENDS,
502 AND A KEG OR TWO OF SUDS, AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE
503 STOPS BREATHING. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S USUALLY AN INNOCENT PERSON, OR ONE
504 OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED PERSONS CHILD, THAT CAME ALONG FOR THE RIDE. THEY
505 WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO GO BUY A SIDE OF BEEF. WHICH WOULD HAVE
506 BEEN CHEAPER THAN A CAMPING TRIP AND TAGS, ANYWAY.
507 I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN RURAL COMMUNITIES, UNTIL JUST RECENTLY AND HAVE
508 SEEN MANY UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS, AS THE ABOVE MENTIONED, SO I PERSONALLY
509 DON'T OWN A GUN. IN FACT, I WON'T ALLOW ONE IN MY HOUSE, SINCE I DON'T 
510 WANT TO EVER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONES DEMISE. AS FOR PROTECTION, IT HAS
511 ALREADY BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT TRAINED OR QUALIFIED ON THE
512 WHOLE TO HANDLE GUNS, BUT THIS IS PROBABLY NOT TRUE IN THE CASE OF CRIM-
513 INALS. IF YOU BRANDISH A GUN AT A TRAINED SHOOTER THAT'S BREAKING AND 
514 ENTERING OR WHAT HAVE YOU, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE. AND BESIDES THE 
515 LAWS ARE ON THEIR SIDE. IF THEY STAGGER BACK AND FALL OUTSIDE THE DOOR,
516 OR EVEN ONTO THE THRESHOLD, CHANCES ARE YOU'LL GO TO PRISON.
517 BESIDES PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY ARE SO JADED TO VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY YOUTHS,
518 THAT A LITTLE KILLING ONCE IN A WHILE IS STIMULATING. WE'VE ALL READ THE
519 STATISTICS ON HOW MANY MURDERS, ETC. CHILDREN HAVE SEEN ON T.V AND MOVIES
520 BY THE TIME THEIR X AMOUNT OF YEARS OLD. SO GUNS ARE VIEWED BY SOME AS
521 A WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. LIKE THE KID WHO SHOT HIS BABY BROTHER OVER A 
522 STUFFED TOY. THE PARENTS FAULT YOU SAY? EXCEPT THAT THE KID GOT THE GUN
523 FROM THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE, WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LEFT THE BACK DOOR
524 UNLOCKED. OR THE TEENAGE GIRL DEVASTED BY A FAMILY DIVORCE AND THEN 
525 GILTED BY HER BOYFRIEND, COMMITS SUICIDE. SORRY, I DON'T MEAN TO GET
526 OVERLY DRAMAITIC, BUT THE POINT IS THESE TYPES ARE REPEATED OVER AND 
527 OVER AGAIN, DAY AFTER DAY. AND YOU STILL SEE PEOPLE CRYING OUT I HAVE
528 MY RIGHTS!
529 I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANY REAL SOLUTION AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY
530 TO SOLVE THESE THINGS. PEOPLE ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR OWN RIGHTS
531 THAT THEY CARE LITTLE ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. ESPECIALLY THE VICTIMS
532 THAT ARE ALREADY DEAD OR MAIMED. I DON'T FEEL LAWS AGAINST GUNS WOULD
533 WORK, WE'VE ALL SEE THE BUMPER STICKERS.........WHEN GUNS ARE OUTLAWED
534 ONLY OUTLAWS WILL HAVE GUNS.....AND........THEY'LL GET MY GUN WHEN THEY
535 PRY IT FROM MY COLD DEAD FINGERS. I AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT IT SHOULD
536 BE REQUIRED TRAINING IN SCHOOLS, ALONG WITH FIRSTAID TREATMENT. THIS
537 WOULD DIMINISH SOME PROBLEMS.
538 I'LL NEVER FORGET THE MOVIES AND SUCH THEY SHOWED WHEN I WAS 14 AND IN 
539 DRIVERS ED. THE STATE I LIVED IN REQUIRED 8 HOUSR OF FILMS, AND I SWEAR
540 THEY PICKED THE GORIEST ONES I'VE EVER SEEN. SURE I PASSED, BUT I DIDN'T
541 DRIVE FOR A WHILE AFTERWARDS. TEENAGERS HAVE A REPUTATION FOR WILD AND
542 CRAZY DRIVING, AND AS I REMEMBER, I DID MY SHARE, BUT THOSE FILMS WERE
543 IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, AND I OUT GREW THE FLIRTIN WITH DISASTER ATTI-
544 TUDE. THE SAME WOULD BE A DETERENT FOR GUNS, TO SOME DEGREE AT LEAST.
545 MY CHILDREN WILL BE TRAINED ANYWAY, AT A GALLERY, OR SHOOTING RANGE,
546 NOT IN THE WOODS, OR STREETS.
547 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!
548 *******************************************************************:
549 DEBORAH: YES, IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE THAT MADE THAT PREVIOUS RESPONSE.
550 (POINT OF NOTE, I ALWAYS SIGN MY NAME TO ANY OF MY ENTRIES.)
551 AS FOR SOME OF THE KILLINGS AS A RESULT OF GUNS BECAUSE OF VARIOUS
552 PASIONS, MAYBE WE SHOULD GET RID OF POISON AND KNIVES AND RAZORS TOO?
553 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE GUN IS JUST ANOTHER TOOL THT CAN BE USED
554 FOR KILLING, THERE ARE MANY MORE OUT THERE THAT CAN BE READILY USED
555 AS A SUBSTITUTE. AS I SAID BEFORE, I DON'T CARE ABOUT GUNS AT ALL,
556 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT IN THEMSELVES THE PROBLEM, JUST AS
557 A CAR DRIVEN BY A DRUNK DRIVER IS NOT THE PROBLEM. MAYBE WE SHOULD
558 GET RID OF ALL THE CARS TO STOP THAT KILLING?
559 AS FOR THE BRANDISHING OF THE GUN, FIRST, MOST PROFESSIONAL THIEVES DON'T
560 CARRY GUNS. THEY KNOW FULL WELL THAT IT IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET YOURSELF
561 KILLED. SECOND, I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD STAND OUT IN THE OPEN
562 AND SAY AHH GEE, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO RECONSIDER WHAT YOUR DOING, I DO
563 HAVE A GUN HERE, SEE..?
564 ALL OF THIS REQUIRES THAT YOU PRESENT A FORCFUL ATTITUDE, AND ARE WILLING
565 TO USE IT AS NECASSARY (THIS DOESN'T MEAN KILLING). I WAS RESPONDING THE 
566 PROPER USE OF A GUN AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM. FIRST YOU WARN OF ITS EXISTANCE.
567 THIS CAN BE DONE BY SIMPLY YELLING FREEZE, OR OTHER ATTENTION GETTING.
568 FROM OR NEAR COVER. DON'T WORRY, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO STICK AROUND AND
569 SHOOT IT OUT, THEY DON'T WANT TO GET KILLED ANY MRE THEN YOU DO. ONE
570 THING ABOUT THIS THOUGH, IF THEY HAVE A GUN IN THEIR HAND ALREADY, DON'T 
571 POINT A GUN AT THEM, OR EVEN BRANDISH IT, JUST RUN. IF THEY DON'T HAVE A
572 GUN IN THEIR HAND, GENERALY THEY WON'T GO FOR IT, AS THEY KNOW FULL WELL
573 THAT YOU COULD EASILY SHOOT THEM BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN GET IT OUT.
574 MIND YOU I DON'T CONDON ANY OF THIS, BUT IT IS INFORMATION THAT YOU
575 SHOULD KNOW AS AN ASPECT OF HAVING TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD AND WHAT TO
576 EXPECT. AS A PERSON ABOVE INDICATED, I TO AM OFTEN VERY SURPRIZED AT THE
577 GREAT STUPIDITY SOMETIMES SHOWN BY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
578 P.S. PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY OF THIS PERSONALLY, I AM JUST ARGUING ONE
579 POINT OF THE VIEW. AS I SAY, I MYSELF AM NOT AT ALL FOND OF GUNS.
580 LEONARD: I AGREE VERY MUCH, I TOO WISH THERE WAS SOMEWAY TO GET
581 THOSE WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE MASS MURDERERS WHO PASS THEMSELVES
582 OFF AS SOLDIERS.
583 ******************************* CISTOP MIKEY *****************************:
584 PAM: What subject would you like to discuss?
585 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
586 The collected thoughts of strange degenerates is available here it seems
587 a street was named after me in Portland.
588 ===================================================================
589    MIKEY: I THINK YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING TOO MUCH TELEVISION. MAX 
590 ===================================================================
591 OH WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD QUIT TAKING THE EXTREEM VIEW POINT.
592 IT SEEMS THAT DESPITE MY DISCLAIMERS THAT I PLOP THROUGHOUT
593 PEOPLE ARE STILL PERSONALY ATACKING ME FOR VIEWS THAT I DON'T
594 NECASARILY HOLD. BUT THEN THAT IS HARDLY ANYTHING NEW, I DO GET
595 TIRED OF PEOPLE ONLY READING THAT WHICH THEY WANT TO SEE AND
596 IGNORING THAT WHICH THEY DON'T. SIGH.....
597 ******************** CISTOP MIKEY **************************
598 BUT, IT SEEMS THAT THE GUN ISSUE DID TURNOUT TO BE A VERY EMOTIONAL
599 ISSUE, FAR MORE SO THEN I EXPECTED. THUS THE LACK OF PERSPECTIVE.
600 ************************************************************
601 WELL, WHO EVER IT IS THEY DON'T SEEM TO KNOW ABOUT DRIVE B. SEEMS
602 THOUGH THAT SINCE THEY COULDN'T ERASE EVERYTHING, NOW THEY DECIDED
603 TO WRITE GRAFFITI ON WHAT IS THERE. THAT'S ALRIGHT, I HAVE OUTLIVED
604 THIS SORT OF THING BEFOR. IF THEY KEEP IT UP THOUGH, I THINK I MAY
605 SEE IF I CAN GET THE PHONE COMPANY TO PUT A TRACE ON IT AND SEND
606 THEM A NICE LITTLE NOTE TO SCARE THE PANTS OFF THEM.
