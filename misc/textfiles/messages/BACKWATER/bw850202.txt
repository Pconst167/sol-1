26 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZippy
27 AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!! So close to the top!!!
28 Well, I never thought I'd see myself write this, but it's good to see the comforting text "ENTER ONLY".
29 ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
30      When the talking pear that was Zachary Leason finished his attractive-sounding offer, my mind had been made up.
31 "Well, are you with us my boy?" He asked. "Sure, why not?" I replied, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible, while 
32 csconcealing my inner exicitement. #Oh boyoboyoboyoboyoboyoboy!!!# I thought ats I mentally wethought of the fun I would
33 have over the next few weeks, or months, or however long it took. "Grand, just absolutely grand! Yes, grand indeed, my 
34 boy, if nothing else, grand!" The middle aged man jiggled. "Here are the keys to the car." He said, tossing(or as close 
35 as a pear can come to tossing) me a keyring with a single key;"You will find it in the garage downstairs. I certainly 
36 hope it meets your approval!", he added. "You may leave whenever you are ready.". #This was too good to be true#, I 
37 though to myself, for no-one else was within brainshot,#But then again, some of these obnoxiously rich men probably
38 enjoy hiring people to do this kind of thing#. But at any rate, I would have a sports car, and the company of a 
39 beautiful woman as I traveled across the country, and I was getting paid for it too! Never being one to look a gift
40 horse in the mouth, I quickly thanked the man three or four times, and slipped out the door. 
41      Trying to find a particular room in this building was like the proverbial trying to find the proverbial needle in
42 the proverbial haystack, only this time, the needle was the same size and shape and color as every one of the strands
43 of hay in the stack. But I eventually found her room. After a knock and a muffled "Come in..." I entered. She must have
44 expected me, for she was wearing a warm-looking coat and a matching hat, which I assumed was perfectly color-coordinated
45 with the sports-car downstairs. "I'm ready," she said, demonstrating this fact by gesturing toward a pile of very
46 heavy-looking luggage. #Oh, God, # I thought as I started on the pile, wondering how all of this could fit into any 
47 existing sports-car, without marring the "Sporty" look of it, not to mention the suspension. 
48 After a rather painful workout, we arrived via the elevator at the parking garage. The car was almost as gorgeous as 
49 Christine. It was a deep shade of blue, with chrome trim, polished to such a degree that it was almost blinding; and
50 this was in the darkened garage, who knows what kind of havoc it could wreack in open sunlight. The entire car couldn't 
51 have been more than three feet tall at the highest point, wgiving the illusion(or was it an illusion?) that it had to
52 be driven lying down. #Hmm, must give an interesting impression to unsuspecting traffic cops...#. I loaded the 
53 surprisingly spacious trunk quickly, as I had a feeling that lying behind the wheel of this beautiful blue baby was 
54 something to be remembered. I was not disappointed. The entire effect was that of the interior of a car on a tv series
55 that couldn't afford real actors, so they used the car instead. I had a feeling that it would be quite a while
56 before I  figured out everything there was to know about the myriad knobs, swiches, and dials that comprised the control
57 panels. After several mis-guesses, and a lot of flak from a certain anonymous passenger-seat driver, I found the 
58 ignition. The almost frighteningly powerful sounding engine turned over with such suddenness and force that I would 
59 have jumped clear into the next seat, were it not for the fact that I had my seat belt on, for which I received several
60 interestingly-shaped bruises on my chest and neck.
61      When I finally regained my composure, I slipped on the sunglasses that were hanging from the rear-view mirror, and
62 slowly pressed the accelerator downward. The car handled like a dream, and soon we were flying along the mid-desert
63 highways, just like in the sports-car commercials...

79 alchemist,
80 	While cleaning out some old files I ran across a message by your hand 
81 way back in October. At the time I had asked what was the name of the craft 
82 that you skippered during that fatefull " Six-pak ". Shortly thereafter my 
83 modem ceased to function. So If you replied - It was never receieved 
84 ... do you often use the ply the waterways by that convenance ? 
85 You had also spoken of becalming of grand proportions in the lee of some
86 fair isle...Please expound ...A sailors tales, recounted against the backdrop
87 of this near blizzard , would warm the soul.
88 
89 FARLEY,
90 	Oh ye of little perseverance..Have you indeed given up the quest for
91 the solution ?

98 Miss Ryan:  The Guardian, don't make me laugh.  I think that undergroung
99 will be revoking your membership real soon if you keep flying off the
100 handle with nothing but information like that.  REALLY (in a discussed tone).
101 f.t. comb:  Unless you are also the BARD, please refrain from using the
102 ~~~~~~~~~~ boarder, two of us is quite enought.   Thanks,
103 TWIT ALERT: Ok, enough about them.  We all know what they are doing to
104 our fine bbs.  If you happen to know one, let me know and me and my
105 smurf friends will pay them a little visit.  Gargamail beware.
106 ALL ANTI-E/O BACKWATER USERS:  Please take the following as an opinion
107 of mine.  I mean no degration of your own minds.
108 ~~~~~~~~~~
109 I think that E/O is an answer to the current T trouble that has been
110 here at the INN latly.  Like all good things, the INN is going thru a
111 rather bad patch of weather (and from the looks of it outside, so are we)
112 right now with childish individuals who are not capable of understanding
113 the INN.  PLEASE continue writing your stories and comments here.  For
114 some of you will be missed if you take on the attitude "I will not enter
115 into the INN unless it is in ALL ALLOWED".  I say fowey, fowey.  Just take
116 a little more time typing your entry, and the rest of use SHOULD be 
117 reading your entry for the meaning and wisdom that went into the entry.
118 NOT for the typos and misspelled words in your entry.  Corrections just
119 take up that much more time that some other user could be using reading
120 yours, and others, fine entries.  So get onto the system, and then get
121 off of it ASAP.  Don't sit and talk on the phone for 15 minutes while 
122 your still attached to the system (YES I MEAN YOU).  That is 15 minutes
123 where time stands still at the INN.              Shut up PaPa and go back
124 to your work.  ok,ok,ok    I will get off of my soapbox full of smurf berries.

138 Nothing is more frustrating to an agent than being mangled. Thanks to the random deleter, a person not even NET is safe

143 *%_)#@*%#_@)_
144     Pushing forward the nearly cleaned plate that once contained a finely prepared filet of fowl, L'homme pondered the 
145 next step the agents were to take. "We came to this section of town since it offers the best opportunity to get
146 information on our missing agents. If what our intelligence collectors tell us is true, and I think we can rest assured
147 that it is, Gaudy Minsky is now in the company with the remnants of the upper echelon lieutenants of the late Rajneesh
148 Dangerfield. They were last seen leaving a North West apartments building by a passing surveillance car. The car attempted
149 to follow the vans the group left in, but was cut off by a Trimet bus driver's flagrant traffic infraction. The driver
150 has been sent back to school for retraining in 'Reactionary Offensive Driving.' The vans were last seen in this general
151 area. Our best bet is to circulate around the neighborhood, and see if we can pick up some clues. Fellows, I want you to
152 take the 'beamer' and head over near Good Sam. hospital. Farley and I are going to take the other car and do a cross
153 member search pattern starting from here."
154     "Other car? What 'other car?'"
155     "You'll see Farley. Let's pay our bill and get out of here. And Fellows, if you are thinking about taking a detour by
156 the 'Golden Arms' apartments, don't!"
157     "Yes boss. What ever you say.", Fellows returned with a grin.
158     #What apartments? Why don't these guys tell me anything?# Farley was getting a little tired of being the odd man out,
159 but he tried not to let it show. 
160      They paid their bill, and headed for the parking lot. Next to the shiny BMW sat a not-so-shiny Fiat 128 coup.
161 "That's the other car!", Farley exclaimed, barely controlling a laugh. "You NET agents sure go first class, don't you?"
162      "I'm surprised at you Farley.", L'homme said, with a mock look of shock on his face. "We drive a car that fits the
163 environment. When in Rome, et cetera... Your Fred would stick out like a porcupine in a balloon factory.", the Man
164 without Parity continued, grimacing at that last metaphor. "Enough bantering. Let's get to work."
165      Fellows drove off, leaving L'homme and Farley in a cloud of Bavarian smoke. "Does FIAT really stand for Fix It Again
166 Tony?", Farley asked. "Let's hope we don't find out.", L'homme answered without missing a beat. "Shall we?"
167      The Fiat left the parking lot of the old Lovejoy Restaurant not with a cloud of Italian smoke, but with a sputter, a
168 cough, the sound of grinding synchro-rings, and at last, forward motion.

171   tilean stepped quickly to the next highest step... the doorman nodded and opened the door quickly... never trust a doorman
172 that likes his job too much thought tilean...
173 
174   tilean walked through the overly large lobby... the european flavor of the hotel was obvious... even the american students
175 tuoring europe was perfect...
176 
177   seeking out the man with the largest authority complex was easy... tilean signed a register... took his keys... and turned
178 away... towards the elevators... before he took two steps... the man at the regisration desk harkened him back for some mail..
179 
180   tilean stabbed the letter into an inside pocket... mangling it just a little bit... and stepped inside the elevator... just
181 in time too... the doors closed and everyone in the elevator stiffened with the usual uncomfort that follows being in close
182 quarters with so many strangers... tilean noticed one graying man in the back of the elevator... he was looking about... and
183 failing miserably at looking innocent...
184 
185   after three minutes of boredom... the elevator going higher and higher... passing the resteraunt levels... higher and higher
186 still... tilean noticed the graying old man slipping his hand in the pocket of an older lady...
187 
188   the hand when removed... held a small coin purse... and an expensive looking watch... a pickpocket of rather low capacity...
189   it was obvious to tilean that the lady had a large roll of money in the other pocket... this pickpocket was not good...
190 
191   acting as if to threaten the pickpocket... tilean tensened the proper muscles to make his shoulder holster prominant... he
192 also wondered what the word miranda would mean to him in this country...
193 
194   the pickpocket saw this and replaced the purse... palming the watch... his ineptness showed... tilean started glatring at
195 the thief's pocket... the one with the watch... soon the pickpocket replaced that too... his ineptness shined...
196 
197   the doors opened immediately... everyone started shuffling out... soon only the tilean... the pickpocket... and an american
198 student were still in the elevator together...
199   the graying pickpocket stmbled slowly up to the floor panel... and pressed the lobby... this pickpocket was old... screening
200 out the effects of age on his style... tilean realized that this man was a first rate theif in his day...
201 
202   the door opened at tilean's floor... tilean and the american student stepped out... the pcickpocket wiped sweat off his brow
203 with his shirt sleeve...
204   his shirt sleeve had been used for that before... tilean noticed as the door closed... tilean regretted his decision to play
205 the house detective role...
206 
207   he inserted his key in the doorknob... turned one way... then the other... soon tilean had the door open and was impressed
208 with the size of his suite...
209   tilean fell into the bed... tired from the long plane ride to brussles... then the copter ride to dethek... tilean was tired
210 of all this...
211 
212   he decided to releive himself of some of this exhaustion... he picked up the phone receiver... held a small device up to the
213 phone... pressed two buttons at once... then dialed the lobby on the actual phone dial...
214 
215 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
216 
217   'aeeiiieeee" screamed one of the three net agents... 'electromagnetic discharge of incredible power' screamed another... one
218 of them had his headset ripped off by this time... the tapes were still turning... the phone tapp was still operating...
219 
220   'the tapes' worried one... 'they're screwed' said another... someone put his headset back on tentatively... only tilean's
221 voice now... the tapp was still operating... but someone ought to get working tapes on line...
222 
223   the other two net agents put their headsets back on... focused their attention... forgetting the tapes for a minute...
224 
225   'desk...? there will be a tall graying man wearing a rumpled suit... he is going to go to the main door... i want your house
226 detective to escort him to this room...' tilean said...
227   'i can't do that sir...' said the desk man...
228   'i own this building... you Will get him up here now...'
229   'yessir... right away sir...'
230   'and whoever i just deafened... sorry about that... normal precautions you know... we all have to follow the rules...'
231 
232   all of the net agents squinted hard... and as expected... the same electomagnetic pulse rippled through the phone lines once
233 again... all of them permitted a scream...
234 
235 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
236 
237   tilean heard the remote screams... muffled by the thin walls... but not by much... tilean stood and walked over to a seat...
238 started waiting for his guests...
239 
240 010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
241 The instructor surveyed the writhing agents and the mangled equipment.
242 "Right. That's a Fail on this assignment. Haven't any of you ever heard
243 of 'optocouplers'? And automatic overload cut-outs?" He paused and 
244 glared once more at the novice agents.
245   "You realize that this is coming out of your pay? If you don't show
246 some improvement, you're OUT! I doubt that even the UNDERGROUND would
247 want you...."

252 those 'control els'...

254 "Tina and I have been doing some talking while you were with the doctor,"
255 Tony said as he helped Jack get into the automobile. "It seems that you're
256 not the only one that's been hurting lately."
257      Jack shhok his head and wiped his face with good hand. "What do you
258 mean by that?  I- I'm sorry, but I'm still not fully grasping things... 
259 It's those cheap drugs you know..."
260      "I know. Don't worry," said Tony, "I'm already paying them back for 
261 that one..."
262      "What? I'm afraid you lost me again."
263      "Yea," said Tina, "what was that supposed to mean- paying them back?"
264 Tony thought that it would be fun letting them sweat the details out of 
265 him, and only led them on bit by bit.
266      "Do you remember that 'test' I did back at Kenna Hall a couple of
267 years ago? The one with the squirel and the oxygen tank?" asked Tony.
268      "I'm on these drugs you see, I can't remember a thing, O.K.? Just 
269 tell us what you did, O.K.?" Jack snorted in reply.
270      "Fine, just fine. Besides, they really didn't need that Conference
271 Room anymore anyway..." Tony said with a grin.
272      "Do you mind filling ME in on what's goin on here?" Tina demanded.
273 Marci was acting indifferent as she was trying to concentrate on getting 
274 back to the condos.
275      "Alright already! I confess I did it, officer." said Tony as he raised
276 his hands over his head. "It all went something like this: First I told an
277 orderly that I needed an oh-two... oxygen tank... for one of the rooms 
278 respiraters and slipped him a fiver. After taking it to an empty, large but
279 empty, conference room, I went to one of the labs to see if they had any 
280 mice. No good, they all died from cancer and coffee already. Anyway, I got
281 a guenie (sp) pig and a running wheel. I took an old lighter and attached the
282 striking assembly to the wheel to create the sparks desired to complete the 
283 'test'. Then, at the other end of the room I turned on the oh-two tank- after
284 having fetched about a dozen more. I think we'll be out of sight before the'
285 fire-trucks arrive..."
286     Although still mixed up from the drugs, Jake smiled and said "Oh, 
287 just that.  Hey, is this the condo?"

291     The benz cruised along, a brezze could be felt thru the back window,
292 bullet holes have a remarkable ablity to cause drafts. Marci let Tina drive
293 and was in the back seat with Jack.  Tony's face was smiling so much, Tina
294 was sure it would crack.(I hate enter only)
295     The smile soon faded as Tony noticed the headlights of a car, following
296 closely; "not again, heads down everyone", "Tina, step on it, lets see if
297 we can lose these bozo's, maybe they are not the same jerks but I don't want
298 to take anymore chances. And besides we have kind of run out of hospitals."
299 Tina complied and pushed the pedal to the metal, the Benz was running in
300 top condition and excelerated rapidly. The car following seemed to be getting
301 farther behind, and then started to catch up. The headlights were moving
302 closer and closer, Tony urged Tina "faster hun, it's real important!"

329   tilean heard the house detective fumbling with his keys... trying to impress the boss with his stealth no doubt...
330   when the door finally opened of it's own accord... three people entered the room... the infamous house detective... the man
331 tilean saw stealing in the elevattor... and a maid...?
332 
333   the sweaty little detective wallowed... the maid was fascinated by the ceilings... and the theif was examining all the exits
334 withing jumping distance...
335 
336   'i would like to know why we were brought here' said the pickpocket... who was proud of being the first to speak up...
337   'i wanna know that to' said the maid... shrillingly high squeaking voice...
338   'why of course... all i can explain is the two of you... i have no idea why you are here miss... do you officer...' tilean
339 aid...
340   'she is a cohort... in cahoots is the american expression i beleive... he picks the pockets... passes them off to her... and
341 she sells the cards... and checks to some of her friends...' said the house detective...
342 
343   not as much of a bumbler as i thought... i really must find out why everyone here is sweating so... it is affecting my first
344 opinions on people... to see someone sweating when you are not... it is a character judgement somehow... how nervous they are
345 i think...
346 
347   'i am not going to waste time asking you if this is true... i know it is... but i am not only the owner of this hotel... i
348 also work for interpol' tilean lied quite well... he waited for them to pick their jaws off the floor so he could go on...
349   'and if i find out who these friends of yours are... and i already know most of them... i will find that they are terrorists
350 also... and if i find that you are selling them identity papers... i will arrange your prosecutian under as many nation's laws
351 as i see fit to' said tilean
352 
353   the maid was stammering... the pickpocket was angry... and the house detective looked so impressed... tilean might hardly
354 beleive it...
355 
356   'you are all dismissed... but miss... chose your company better... i should not like to find you in a gutter like your poor
357 friend ella...' said tilean...
358   the maid choked... and ran out the door fast as the dickens... the pickpocket stumbled after the poor dear... and the house
359 detective walked lightly behind them all... after first nodding to tilean...
360 
361   tilean answered the nod... 'no i am not an interpol agent... the newspapers carried the news of a terrorist associated death
362 of a young maid named ella... it all made perfect sense...'
363   the house detective ran after the fleeing pair... tilean decided they would make no more trouble here...
364 
365   the young girl would choose her company better... forget ever having aided terrorists... and the pickpocket would set up a
366 shop in another hotel... probably live out his years in comfort one might expect...
367 
368   tilean got up... closed the door... and went over to the bathroom... and the shower... and was soon singing badly in it...
369   after twenty minutes of being immersed in warm water... tilean stepped out of the bath... donned a bathrobe and started to
370 dry his hair with one of the towels marked with the name of the hotel...
371 
372 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
373 
374   a rather young phone operator... working for the same hotel tilean was staying at... noticed the little green light lite up
375 for the first time in it's existance... someone used the pulse... thought the girl...
376 
377   she remember holding the manuals in odd positions trying to install the pulse... nearly impossible for her to do... but in
378 the end... it all worked...
379   of course... now that another thrike agent was quartered here... the anti surveilance gear was doing it's job... and some
380 poor phone tapsman was reeling about on the floor...
381 
382   standard gear really... thrike had it installed in every safe hotel... along with a number of other gadgets... only known to
383 thrike agents... and all were standard gear... really...
384 
385 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
386 
387   i despise enter only... it has advantages... but it still is blasted embarrassing... how many of us want to be unable to
388 cover up the amount of mistakes we make...?

455 tests for normality, since when rolling dice, such a test would be meaningless. Data comparisons with Chebyshev's rule of
456 standard deviations and comparisons with the empirical rule where also left out since they are used mainly with normal
457 curves. Calculated chi-square values with 3 degrees of freedom ranged from 5 to 16. Enjoy and contemplate!

505 called "Codes and Ciphers" by Frank Higenbottam. It was in the Language
506 section. (One of those "Teach Yourself..." books. Yellow cover with a
507 dark band across the top). If they don't have it they can order it.

549 How I hate being so close to the bottom of a disk.
550 Alex: If you would, sir, loan me about two weeks that I could expend simultaneously with the next two weeks, I could,
551 perhaps, have enough time to work on it some more.  I'm surprised I have the time anymore to get on BW.  I did,
552 however, take another look at the code today.  I keep feeling that there's something VERY obvious that I'm missing.
553 Voyeur: "Secret Writing", I forget the author's name at the moment.  If you capture disks or know someone who does then
554 the author's name will be on a recent one.  I believe I showed you the book at a PorSFiS meeting some time ago.
555 I hope Alex or Milchar won't mind me answering for them.

557 Although shoddy-looking, the Fiat ran smoothly and was quite comfortable.  L'homme navigated the streets as if he had
558 memorized each one, or had spent hours studying the route.  I decided that keeping busy would keep my mind off Fred,
559 so I began scanning the surroundings.
560 The streets were fairly empty for the afternoon.  Minute by minute we kept moving along, taking in everything that went
561 by.  "L'homme?", I began.
562 "Yes, Farley?"
563 "Tell me, how did NET get started?", I asked.
564 "That's a long story, Farley, and we haven't time to get into that now.  Wait!  Did you see that van?"
565 A van crossed the intersection a few blocks over from where we were.  Its kindred followed close behind it.  "Yeah."
566 L'homme spun the wheel rapidly.  "I hope you've got your seatbelt on, and that you don't get carsick easily!"

573 UNDERGROUND transmission enciphered in Mark 1 code.  This transmission is 
574 believed to be in the hands of NET.  Mark 2 cipher has been prepared if it 
575 should happen tha the Mark 1 cipher is compromised.

582 ...It was amazing.  My sight shifted back to normal.  It seemed, while my
583 vision shifted to red, that my body moved at a fantastic rate.  About 5X normal
584 I would say.  #To hell with the examination, I'm going to test this.#, I
585 thought smugly.
586 But how to start that shift again?  I concentrated hard.  Nothing happened.
587 Dr. Juzem re-entered the lab and watched me for a moment.
588 "Still feeling woozy, Harry?", he asked.
589 "Naw, just thinkin'.  Say, how did ya say I was ta start the acceleration?"
590 Juzem smiled.  "How about tapping your heels together three times?", he joked.
591 "C'mon, get serious.  I wanna test this thing out."
592 "I don't think it's safe to begin the  process this early, Harry.  Just be
593 patient."
594 I slammed my hand against a nearby table in disgust of 'procedure'.  Pain
595 shot up through my arm.
596 Suddenly, my vision shifted to red again.  Seizing the opprotunity, I dressedd
597 VERY fast and whizzed by Dr. Juzem while he stood there, dumbfounded.
598 "Bye, Doc!", I called back.  "See ya soon!"
599 "Wait!" he managed to spurt out.  "You've no idea..."
600 And then, I was out of hearing range.  The turns were harder to navigate than
601 at normal speed, but not overly so.  Reaction time up, speed up...
602 I burst through the outside door.  "Burst" is a very good description here-
603 the door didn't open fully in time and so the glass tinkled on the pavement
604 outside.
605 My head hurt.  Just as quickly as my vision had shifted to red, it shifted
606 back.  #Pain!  Pain is the key.  When I feel pain, it switches me from one mode
607 to the other.  Now I'll see if I can get some results for John.  Maybe he'll
608 put me in Elizabeth's position.#

612      It is cold, and the moonlight is not really enought to see clearly by.
613 For the last few hours I have been feeling my way, with the lower branches
614 tearing at my wet cloak.  There are scraches on my arms and face.
615      TThe sickness that has gripped me has taken me over has robbed me of 
616 nearly all my strength.  	I have not been able to eat for three days.  The
617 hunger knaws at me but the thought of food grips my throat in warning.  
618 Maybe tomorrow.
619      The cough returns, forcing me to stop.  It grips my chest and tears at
620 my throat.  The muscles in my sides flare with pain.  It forces me to sit 
621 and hold my sides untill it stops.  I sit for a moment longer, the rain 
622 soaking through my cloak and my pants.
623      	I close my eyes, my lips barely moving, bringing the past into my 
624 mind, bringing the control.  Slowly I relax, the fiber of my body softens,
625 like the wax of a too warm candle.  
626      My eyes open.  The pain, the soreness, the cough, gone.  The cold not
627 even felt.
628      On my first breath I smelled the smoke.  Oak.  Cured I am sure.  Maybe
629 a home or an inn.   This risk may have paid off.    [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/]
