30 TO 'd.l.' while it may be possible to obtain the 'back issues'
31 of BWMS, there are quiet a few of them back up since OCT. I have been
32 averaging a new disk every 2 weeks. maybe we can figure out a way to
33 get the info to you. Can you read 8" CPM disks? If so I can upload
34 to that format If you send me a couple of disks. One 8" CPM disk

58 As to the Vic-20 & Commodore 64 vs Radio Shack I think that the
59 VIC is to be preffered to a Model I, BUT JUST BARELY!!! It has
60 the same kind of mess with regard to expansion that the TRS-80
61 Mod I had. As for breakdowns, I have had 2 hardware problems
62 since I bought my Model III 3 years ago. One was a bad key switch
63 the other we never did figure out (after many hours, the tech
64 decided it would be quicker to just replace the main board)
65 But I don't see much point in arguing about which system is
66 "best". I could get into silly arguments about the VIC not
67 using ASCII, but so what? If it works for YOU, fine I wish you
68 well. My system works for ME so don't hassle. If your system 
69 DOESN'T work then sell it & buy something else (if you can
70 afford to....)

110 session to straighten myself out. The Vic is not a bad computer
111 at all. I figured that all the letters I got about disagreements
112 that I was wrong. So, I checked into it, putting a label on

120  John,
121    Please read the message above. I agree with you about the
122 Radio Shack Computer Centers. Those dudes don't know their ass
123 from a hole in the ground and they are working, in all places,
124 a COMPUTER CENTER!?!?!?! I think that they are there to rip
125 you off, harass you, lead you in the wrong direction or anywhere
126 where you don't wanna go. The only person in the whole store
127 who is even polite are the managers. But, I still like the Color
128 Computer better. Some people are so set in their ways that they
129 can't change. Also, if I get another cheap computer, I will get
130 a 64. I don't think I will even bother with Radio Shack anymore.
131 If I get an expensive computer, I will get the LNW-80. Its reall
132 a nice machine. I have looked inside my model I computer finding
133 some pretty god-awful stuff. One time I took my keyboard in for
134 repair and they charged me double for opening it up. Who owns
135 the computer anyway and why are they concerend about what we
136 do to their (uh, I mean our) computers? The jerks!!

166   Radio Shack is a scummy place. Also, believe it or not, I
167 had my computer in for repair once. I called up to see how it
168 was coming along, and they didn't even know where it went!
169 I called and called (about an hour) until they told me they sent
170 it into another place to get it fixed. I got it back about a
171 week and a half later; Just for a busted "R" key....

176 Methinks these young ones now not whereof the likes of
177 dragon lady and the Grey Ghost do journey from.
178 They are all steel and things and there is no poetry in them
179 them. The Ghost does come but not as often for there
180 are many duties for him to perform, speak to me though,
181 and in a little while I shall answer.
182 ----------------Grey Ghost----------------------------
183 
184 Yeah though I walk through this valley of sand and steel, 
185 I would not be alive but for the voices of song that 
186 occasionally appears here. Indeed there are many things
187 yet unanswered. Doth the believer yet screem in the still
188 of the night? Has he found his dream, or does he yet still
189 live in a nightmare world all alone. And what of his
190 once companion Leo the Bull? What new lands and adventures 
191 has he partaken?
192      Of Leo the Bull there is no word, but perhaps he will
193 reappear sometime soon.
194      The spark of life has taken flame in the believer, yet
195 still it is weak and yet to falter. Though his nightmare
196 continues it is not so dark for he sees that his own 
197 salvation can only be found through himself. 
198 Though he did find the scorpion of desire, the sting was not
199 forth coming, for the scorpion did run and hide under a rock
200 and is unwilling to come out despite all offers of kind.
201 For yet do I walk in this world of light, darkened by the
202 lack of the firery sting of the scorpions delight.
203 For though I have seen the way yet must I still trod it to
204 reach the goal I have set. For though the path is known
205 it is frought with deception and fear yet still it is
206 light by the friends I hold dear. My hope it is clear and
207 the path I must follow for never again can I return to 
208 that dark world alone. Yeah do I hope and pray that I need
209 never return at all for it is the end of life that that 
210 road leads to those who follow it. As always befor and
211 yet still again I remain +++ the Believer +++++++++++++

254 enjoy the Vic, you enjoy the RS units. That's all there is to it. The only
255 reason I wrote the fiery letter is because I felt you were making Judgements
256 that you could not really make until you used the machine. The RS units
257 aren't as bad as I said. I don't enjoy them (they've got no personality as
258 far as computers are concerned), but they're not bad. I DO dislike Radio

331 *********************
332 Let's get this straight:  All personal computers available today suck.  Why?
333 If you've ever used a REAL (term used by megacomputer people) computer, I.E.
334 a VAX, CDC 7600, IBM 370, Honeywell, etc, you know how it 'feels.'  Automatic
335 print queueing, real-time operation, schedulable jobs, multiple user and
336 multiple tasking, very high speed.
337 	Of course, it may be unfair to compare a $3000 computer to a $300K
338 computer, but remember, 8 years ago the best PC available (almost the only
339 one) was an Altair.  With no disks, no tape (not until later...) and a
340 stupid front panel, it was the BEST.  These days, even a $69 ZX-81 beats
341 it by a mile.
342 	But until the day when the lowest form of PC runs a processor
343 faster than an iAPX 286, when hard disks (or faster) are standard, when
344 truly usable operating systems are common, I'll still dread using my own
345 computer, a micro.  Eventually, say 10 years from now, you'll know what
346 I mean.
347  By the way, I'm no large-computer nerd.  I hardly ever use them,
348 anymore.  But when I do, the differences are obvious.
349 =====================
350 To:Tron		From: Leonard
351 	SOME of Radio Shack's policies on repair make sense when
352 you stop to think about them. They don't charge extra for opened
353 machines anymore, UNLESS there are user mods. If it has been 
354 modified and it looks like the mod MAY be involved in the
355 problem that the machine was brought in for they give you a
356 choice of fixing it yourself (there's still a charge for the
357 time they spent checking the machine) or having them remove the
358 mod and restore the machine to its original condition. One of
359 the reasons for higher prices on user modified machines is that
360 if they have to replace a board that has been modified they
361 can't give you credit for the old board (normally they would
362 send the old board back to the "factory" to be stripped & 
363 refurbished, but 1 trace cut and they don't get credit for the
364 board!!!).  As to the machine being sent elsewhere, they only
365 have 1 service center in town (unless the Powell Comp. Center
366 has theirs now). If you don't take it to the store on Barbur
367 you can count on several extra days delay in repair. It also
368 helps to make friends with the service techs (who usually feel
369 the same way you do about the salespeople!). It to 20 minutes
370 for me to get a "T" key replaced (I got the old key too!).
371 	There are good, knowledgable people working for R/S
372 but they don't fit the "system" very well.
373 	As for terminal software, if you have disk get a 
374 Videotex package from Radio Shack. The VIDTEX tape program
375 that you get with it will let you download a fairly good disk
376 based terminal program from Compuserve (CHEAP!!). That's the
377 program I'm using.

383 BE POINTED OUT THAT IT WASN'T ALL THAT LONG AGO THAT THE MAINFRAMES

434 CONCERNING THE SPELLING OF ANY MESSAGE LOGGED ON THIS BOARD-DOES IT
435 REALLY MATTER? IF THE PERSON WHOIS READING IT CAN CONFIRM WHAT IS BE-
436 ING STATED THEN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM:ARE WE ALL ENGLISH TEACHERS WITH
437 OUR GRADE BOOKS? CONCERNING THE SHARED IDEAS ABOUT SECURITY OF SYSTEMS
438 IS ANYONE AT THE POINT THAT THEY NEED SYSTEM PROTECTION????WILL PUT
439 INTERESTED PARTIES TOGETHER WITH A PROGRAMMER-(DOCTORATE OF MATH AND 
440 PHYS'ICS,GEOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY-RETIRED FROM EVERY MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTOR
441 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMER OF MISSLE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS,WITH
442 A NEW EPROM THAT CAN PRETTY WELL STOP ANY INTRUSION INTO YOUR SYSTEM
443 BEING UPGRADED EVERY DAY AS NEW USES COME UP     
444 I FINALLY FOUND OUT HOW TO TURN THIS THING ON BECAUSE HE LEFT HIS PAPER
445 WORK AND NOTES TO THE SYSTEMS-HE CALLS THEM HIS HOBBY THAT WORKS IN
446 WITH HIS JOB BUT I THINK IT'S ALL BULLSHIT WHILE I'M AT HOME AND HE'S 
447 OFF WITH HIS BUDDIES TALKING ABOUT THIS STUPID MACHINE-WHAT ABOUT ME AND
448 HIS KIDS???????HE TALKS ABOUT THIS STUPID SHIT IN HIS SLEEP AND GETS
449 BUMMED OUT WHEN I WAKE HIM UP IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME DATA TRANSMISSION

452 AND THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO KEEP RECORDS BUT I FIND MYSELF DOING THE
453 SAME THING AFTER 4 YEARS-THE DINNER IS BURNED NOW.THE TIMER ON THE
454 MICROWAVE WAS SET BUT IT DIDN'T WORK SO WE ARE EITHER GOINTG OUT TO

475 LEONARD,
476 MY SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A 48K LEVEL II WITHOUT DISK SYSTEM AND A
477 DIRECT CONNECT MODEM I. ALL OF THE SOFTWARE I USE IS HOMEBREW
478 AND PRETTY CRAPPY. I HAVE MANAGED TO SQUEEZE A LITTLE BIT
479 OF GOOD STUFF OUT. DO YOU HAVE A TAPE TERMINAL PROGRAM THAT
480 ALLOWS YOU TO UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD, SAVE MODEM TO TAPE AND ETC....?

488      Ah, what a busy place this Backwater Inn has become!  Even females
489 are now found here--what a shock!  As for their choice contributions, I
490 say:  Pah!  with utter disgust; such blather has neither dignity nor
491 class.  And for the uncouth replies--I am appalled at you, my friends.
492      Give yourself another name, O honourable Humbug!  I cannot bear to
493 label you so unworthily...So you wish to uncover the hidden, do you?
494 Are you questing for the meaning of the mystery, or do you merely desire
495 to look beyond that misty veil?  Ask more clearly; then I will respond.
496 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>     d     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
497 d, your words resonate through the halls of our inn with a familiar ring. 
498 I have not seen thy likes before, but thou art welcome. Few of our people
499 speak with such grace as thou! I beg another visit from thee.

502 Sure, d, it's natural I think to play Clue in real life, without dice and
503 weapons.  But it would be refreshing to find a balanced, active mind here
504 among the hoi polloi and the childish by inclination and duration.  One as
505 yourself who can converse romantically and poetically (though in truth I
506 find that prose fosters clarity and poetry benefits from rhyme and meter)
507 has more than words to share:  sounds like you travel, read, and judge for
508 yourself, independent thinker.  My own independence has been perpetual, only
509 moderately wavering infrequently.  I freely share the influences of that 
510 freedom, for what I believe are and can be its virtues for individuals and
511 for social groupings.  Even though Humbug fits, it's Dave by parental decree,
512 if you like.  You plan but a brief stay...why?        A demain.   Humbug

580 Why don't we just think hard and fly away...
581 -----
582 dear sloth,
583 	I must correct you on a few points. Firstly, the language that you seem
584 to think is "Olde English" is in fact MODERN English! Old English is Anglo-Saxon
585 Middle English is Chaucer et al. The psuedo-Shakespearean prose on here is
586 Modern English. 
587 	Secondly, I find the properly spelled & punctuated prose easier to read
588 than some of the other things here!

590 Tron: lotsa luck finding a terminal program that will upload & download from
591 TAPE! I did a lot of looking but never found one! I guess you'll just have to
592 wait for disk.

605 OOPS  ANY WAY I HAVE A TIMEX 1000 THAT RUNS MORIS CODE FOR AMATUR RADIO
606 IT WORKS VERY WELL FOR THAT SO I THINK A COMPUTER IS AS CAPABLE AS THE PERSON
607 RUNNING IT.
608 ALSO DIFFERENT STROKES AND ALL THAT STUFF I HAVE A SANYO MBC 1000, IM NOT UP
609 TO THE COMPUTER YET BUT I WILL KEEP AFTER IT AND MASTER IT SOMEDAY.......
