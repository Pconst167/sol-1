23 CISTOP MIKEY - While I have defended your right to vote for Mickey, or
24                Noneoftheabove, I too am standing up for my beliefs.
25                While Mr. Reagan is not perfect (who among us can claim
26                that distinction ?), he has done a great deal of good
27                for the country.  Pride in the U.S. is way up, the
28                actual number of people who have jobs is up very
29                dramatically, inflation is held to a reasonable level,
30                and personal income taxes have been cut.  Disposable
31                income is at its highest level in history.  That is
32                what is really important.
33                There will not be a nuclear war as long as MAD is still
34                operative.  That is why we need to continually upgrade
35                our delivery systems.  The bombs themselves are ample,
36                but we must ensure that they will be delivered in an
37                effective manner.
38                I am definitely voting for Mr. Reagan.  Any other
39                choice is not only a vote for socialism, it is a vote
40                to destroy the good that has been built in the last four
41                years.
42                Social programs, not religion, are the opiate of the 
43                masses.

63 As I understand it the Libertarian Party has been making steady gains
64 in the last couple of presidential elections. They may have even gotten an 
65 electoral vote last time! 
66 Speaking of electoral votes, they only have to vote the way their state
67 did ONCE! If the election isn't decided on the first vote the electors are 
68 free to vote for whomever they wish!

70 dear mikey, join me and vote for pat paulson. I have voted
71 for paulson since 68 and find it more to the point than voting for none 
72 of the above, as paulson is a comedian. Of course, i did vote for real can-
73 didates twice, reagan and carter. This year it's back to paulson, rather 
74 than be involved in this sordid re-run of the last two elections. Even the 
75 year i worked on the mcgovern campaign i ended up voting for paulson, because
76 of the eastland issue (for those of you who were born by then).
77 
78 if you vote for none of the above, they just lump you in with those who don't
79 vote at all in the statitics. If you vote for paulson, or mickey mouse, they
80 have to count the number of people who did that, so the protest is more effec-
81 tive.

96 Mellow Man - Well said, as true as a metaphor can be.
97   
98 Laissez-faire - I too enjoyed your elaboration on the reality metaphor. 
99    Yes, change is the very nature of this reality we experience. Since all
100    of us have a part in it, each of us has their part to play. As to the
101    model for describing the brain, I prefer the idea of the brain viewed
102    as a multi-dimensional hologram. The laser which illuminates this memory
103    is consciousness. This develops to the idea of a means of perception that
104    determines the direction of it's own perception. Voila`, feedback!

110 If you truly do believe in Reagan, then yes, vote for him. Just don't expect
111 me to do so. Yes, (horrors!) I voted for him last time, as at the time I 
112 was so fed up with Jimmy's wishy washyness running the country into the
113 dump that I was willing to vote for anything that would have even the 
114 remote chance of doing something to change things. And yes, I will agree
115 that things have at least slowed down from the head long charge into
116 federal backrupcy. But that doesn't mean I feel that Reagan is now
117 suitable for the position. His continual verbal blasting of the soviets
118 makes me extremly nervous. Nor do I feel any safer because there are
119 going to be more missles pointed at Moscow. It in fact makes me feel 
120 even more nervous particularly when we have someone as trigger happy
121 as Reagan with his finger over the button. I am no more happy with
122 Mondale and his traditional democratic liberal spending policies of
123 'lets create some niffty programs out there, we'll worry about where
124 the money will come from some other time. Right now I want to look
125 like a good guy.'  Sorry Friz, but irresponsible expenditure of funds
126 you don't have makes you a bad guy in my viewpoint. As was said elsewhere,
127 as far as Jessy, religion and politics don't mix. It has been proven time
128 and time again in history. (but then we seem to seldom learn from history.)
129 Glenn is a nice guy, but hardly leadership material. The same goes for
130 Cranston. I was actually rooting for Hart, not because he was best, but 
131 rather because I didn't find anything excessivly negative about him,
132 and he seemed to have slightly better then average intelligence. He at
133 least didn't subscribe to the excessive spending sprees that Mondale
134 does. Being a registered Republican, my choice of note voting for Reagan
135 is a bit more significant. I basicly agree to the Republican structure
136 of less government is best. but I am against the direction it has taken
137 of late in making things cushy for the rich. (I don't agree with the
138 Democratic concept that there shouldn't be any rich however, I just don't
139 think the rich should be given any more advantages or restrictions then
140 anyone else.) Nor do I agree with the Libertarian concept of no
141 government is best. There are many advantages to has a responsible
142 government. An example: The extensive road system we have today that
143 has been the backbone of our enormous progress could not have been
144 done by private industry. Private industry does not care about the 
145 individual, they are only concerned with themselves. As such, roads would
146 only have been installed where they needed them, and cross country 
147 freight would still be done by the railroads which is a far more efficient
148 way to do long distance travel anyway. (The problem is that it doesn't
149 deliver to your front (or rear) door.) But I've ranted far too long,
150 and said more than I had intended, (I hadn't even intended to say anything
151 on the subject at all, but somehow I seem to have done so.).

216    To continue studying the impacts of placing a "none of the above" option
217 on the ballot via initiative, we must define what happens if "none of the
218 above" wins.  To be really meaningful, a majority for "none of the above"
219 must cause major political dislocation (indeed, is that not the purpose of
220 that choice?)  Let's take the local level first.  If in city or county
221 government, for example the race for a city councilperson or county
222 commisioner, the position recieved a "none of the above" vote, it must imply
223 that none of the available candidates is acceptable to those who felt 
224 strongly enough about the issue to vote.  The question then becomes one of
225 how to get the acceptable candidates to run for the office, get their views
226 known, and get a majority to allow them to serve.  I feel that a second 
227 election, open to all comers, should be held within 30 days of the election
228 in which "none of the above" won.  The rejected candidates could run again,
229 but should have marked against their names on the ballot the words
230 "previously rejected" in type size, color, and style identical to that in
231 which their names appear.  This process should continue until offices are
232 filled.  (somehow I can't feel too worried about the office remaining
233 unfilled through its term -- and it might not hurt anyway)

236 Andrew, me chicken out?  sorry.  I did take my name out of your speach
237 on db.  I had my own a little lower about all these clods votes and how
238 much they don't count worth a darn at all.  Me chicken out?  All this
239 talk won't change a thing, well maybe your ego's.  Fealing neat because
240 they had a little say in what was going on.  But does it realy matter
241 what president you vote for when they anounce the winner before you even
242 get to vote?

246 PIPER: NICE SPEECH. AS TO THE PERSON ABOVE SAYING I AM NOT REALLY
247 VOTING IF I VOTE FOR NONEOFTHEABOVE. SURE, I COULD VOTE FOR PAT LIKE
248 BATPOOP, BUT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME AS VOTING FOR NONEOFTHEABOVE
249 AS FAR AS ANY REAL RESULTS ARE CONCERNED. (I'M NOT FOOLING MYSELF,
250 I DO KNOW THAT REAGAN OR MONDALE WILL WIN NO MATER WHAT I DO.) BUT
251 RATHER THEN THROWING AWAY MY VOTE BY VOTING FOR ONE OF THEM WHEN
252 I DO NOT FEEL THAT EITHER ONE IS ACCEPTABLE, OR NOT BOTHERING TO
253 VOTE AT ALL BECAUSE IT WON'T MATTER ANYWAY, INSTEAD I HAVE DECIDED
254 TO AT LEAST SATISFY MY OWN SELF RESPECT AND VOTE IN A WAY THAT I
255 CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT. SURE, I KNOW THAT IT WILL PROBABLY BE IGNORED
256 EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A SNICKER AND OR SNORT BY SOME POOR VOTE COUNTER
257 WHO HAS TO GO THROUGH AND COUNT ALL THE WRITEINS, BUT I AM NOT VOTING
258 FOR YOU NOR FOR ANYONE ELSE, "I AM VOTING FOR MYSELF!" SINCE I KNOW 
259 THAT IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT I DO, I CAN AT LEAST PROVIDE
260 MYSELF A LITTLE BIT OF SATISFACTION IN KNOWING I VOTED IN THE WAY
261 I FOUND ACCEPTABLE. I REMEMBER IN MY YOUNGER DAYS WHEN I TOO WAS
262 BRAINWASHED INTO BELIVING THAT YOU HAD TO PLAY THE GAME BY THEIR
263 RULES, AND I HAD TO VOTE FOR 'THE WINNER'. SINCE THEN MY MORALS
264 HAVE GOTTEN IN THE WAY, AND NOW I VOTE FOR MYSELF INSTEAD. AND,
265 I'VE FOUND THAT IT MAKES ME A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MYSELF
266 TO EXPRESS MY OWN OPINION IN MY OWN WAY RATHER THEN FOLLOWING THE
267 HERD AND ECHOING WHAT SOMEONE UP FRONT SAYS IS RIGHT.

318    discussion on the pros and cons of playing the stock market. Surely you
319    must have some stories that can warm the hearts of players all over this
320    great land of ours. What do you think of this latest rally? How about
321    the suddent downturn the dollar is taking on foreign markets? Have you
322    ever tried your luck at any stock market simulations? Do you use your
323    computer to chart the stocks you own? Just to get things going...

358    Well, let's take another look at an 'official' nonoftheabove ballot entry.
359 Local governments could, indeed, live with it.  The major problem seems to
360 lie with federal elections.  Where US law conflicts with state law, US wins.
361 (remember the golden rule -- tjehem that gots the gold makes the rules)  The
362 real purpose of an 'official' noneoftheabove ballot entry is to provide a
363 visible measure of dissatisfaction.  Certainly a noneoftheabove entry would
364 be in order for the party primarys.  (Since I am registered repub., I voted
365 where I thought it might have some effect and left the pres. spot blank.)
366 I certainly would have liked to have a 'noneoftheabove' entry there, and I
367 suspect several dems would feel the same.
368    Since we have been accused of all talk and no action, I therefore put 
369 forth, as a serious proposal, that we as residents of Oregon begin an 
370 initiative campaign to place a noneoftheabove entry on each office voted
371 on in the state of Oregon.  Folks, I'm dead serious about this -- I've
372 been disenfranchised and don't like it.  Even if you like one of the 
373 (words fail me here -- politicians??) running for office, you may not like
374 the "choice" in the future.  We do have a method for really changing things.
375 It will not be a cheap and easy battle -- resistance to change is almost
376 always difficult to overcome -- but it can and will be done.  I estimate that
377 it will take at least one or two tries, a lot of time, a lot of effort, and
378 some real commitment.  What are the problems?  What are the objections?
379 What wording will give the disenfrancised some teeth to sink into the legs
380 of their political opressors?

401 &&&&&&&&&&&&& MR Ham CUTTER - You are quite threatening (?) &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
402 ................................................................................
403   Ham Cutter, that was not the best way to re-introduce yourself.  Most of
404 the sillyness that you are hollering about is past.  And your threats and
405 " my gun is bigger than your gun " contest ( to who ever came up with that
406 first, I love it and I had use it again ) really doesn't impress me a bit.
407 Knowing you, you are now vowing to break my neck, but that is just another
408 one of your problems.  It would be best if you chaneled you violent anger
409 towards the creation of your board, linebackers, or at least in-animate
410 objects ( linebackers almost fitting that catagory ).  As for your friends,
411 I know them as well as you do, and they are not really put out by some
412 insult trading.  I'm not trying to get you ticked, but some of my advice
413 might save your some trouble, and some hard feelings.  You should really
414 just calm down, and act rational, or at least inteligent.  You will 
415 eventually conform to this system, whether you want to or not, or you will
416 leave.  Simple as that...
417   As for my entry about Reagan, I was just expressing my fears about him
418 in an irrational teenager fashion.  I do not like to live in a country with
419 economic woes, and a President who promises efverything to everyone for a
420 vote, nor do I like a President who plays with nuclear fire.  When you play
421 with fire, you get burned ( badly ).  Strike another one up for " None of
422 the Above ".

427 Andrew,
428 
429  I think that last sentance in the first paragraph was way out of line.  How
430  can you or anyone (besides the system operator) tell people what they can do
431  or can't.  He, like every other person who writes messages has the right to
432  be an individual.  If it offends you thats not his fualt, you don't have to
433  read it do you?  I must say that he opened up with a lot of insults but he
434  can type that in if he feels like it.  It's his right.  Everyone on this 
435  system is being themselves, not some fake cover so everyone will think that
436  he is neat.  Being yourself is one of our most precious abilities.  If
437  people couldn't be so, where would this country be right now?  I'm sure it
438  wouldn't be as it is today.  Now I'm ticked off, I really didn't want t be
439  this way but thats how it goes...

444 TO MIG:
445  HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND AMUSING?  HOW EVERYTIME I BRING UP A SUBJECT FOR\
446  DICUSION YOU ALWAYS FIND SOME WAY TO AVOID IT.
447 
448  AS J.C. WOULD SAY "DO NOT JUDGE OTHERS UNIL YOU YOURSELF ARE PERFECT"
449 
450 NOW WHAT IS THIS LIE ABOUT THROWING TEDDY SALAD UP AGAINST A WALL AT HIS 
451 PRIVATEV RESIDENCE?  IT SEEMS TO ME YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR A PERSONS 
452 RIGHT TO PRIVACY!  REMENBERA FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN YOU DEMANDED THAT YOU
453 WERE GOING TO GIVE MARK FORSYTH A CALL(THAT IS FORSYTH WITH THE Y PRONOUNCED
454 AS A HARD 'I' AND NO 'E') WELL I THINK I ALREADY GAVE A HINT ABOUT THAT.
455 
456 IF YOU DID INDEED THROW SOMEONE AGAINST THE WALL WHO WAS IT? IT WASN'T 
457 TEDDY SALAD.
458 
459 BY THE WAY YOU HAD BETTER WATCH THE WAY YOU TREAT PEOPLE. YOU ARE 17 AND\
460 ONCE YOU HAVE ANOTHER ANIVERSERY OF YOUR BIRTH OU CAN GET IN BIG TROUBLE
461 JUST LIKE ANY OTHER GROWN-UP(AGE NOT MENTAL MATURITY) I AM THINKING ABOUT
462 ATTENDING A PORSPISS MEETING SOME TIME. BETTER START CHECKING UNDER THE 
463 TABLE HA HA.
464 
465 
466 LISTEN JAY, I REALLY DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.  I AM JUST SICK AND TIRED OF
467 BEING TREATED LIKE A FRESHMAN. MY FREINDS AND I HAVE BEEN LOGGING ON LONG
468 ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WE DO NOT LIVE IN 'DWID CITY'. SO LETS JUST
469 DROP IT AND GO ON WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A CAT
470 AS A PRESIDENT AND A FAT PENGUIN AS HIS RUNNING MATE? I'M TALKING ABOUT
471 THE BEST QUALIFIED TEAM IN BLOOM COUNTY. BILL THE CAT AND OPUS. ONCE I GET
472 THE TIME I AM GOING TO WRITE A BOARD BASED ON THE STRIP
473 EXPECT A NEW CHARACTER JOINING YOUR STORY. DON'T WORRY I GOT PERMISSION.
474 
475 WELL THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH FOR NOW.
476 
477                              HAVE A NICE DAY,

486 OBNOXIOS OBSCIENITY? (I love it, hardly a word over 5 letters spelled

494 re:  religion.

496 
497 One afternoon recently, the Pope was sitting in his office looking out
498 over Vatican City.  The White phone rings.  It's God on the line.
499 
500      "Good afternoon Lord", somewhat pensively: "Hows things with you?"
501 
502      "Just fine!  No need too worry, in fact I have some special news for
503 you.  I've decided to accept your suggestion of One World Church."
504 
505      "Lordy!  That's fantastic!" exclaims the pope, "Just think, everyone
506 believing the same thing, worshiping you, Lord, in the same way.  No strife,
507 no more war.  And my career!  It will sky rocket.  Praise The Lord!"
508 
509 "Hold on, hold on.  Slow down,"  sayeth the Lord, "sit down while I tell 
510  you this:  I'm calling from Antelope, Oregon."
511 /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\random/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
512 ^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^..^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^^
513 God? calling from Antelope Oregon? right! The whole idea of a church is
514 quite silly.  Praising something that probably doesn't even exist at all. way
515 back in history i bet there were a bunch of guys sitting around a table. they
516 were so bored they decided to make up someone that could get them attention,
517 and boy did it ever.  these twelve con-men are just living it up. just think
518 of it, millions of people believing in a so called god that didn't even exist
519 back when.  geez, these were some clever guys.  our whole system of everything
520 is based around their little party one night. they have a best selling book,
521 all the coins have " in god we trust " on them and they are having a blast.
522 they had to be pretty blasted when they wrote some of that book too i tell ya.
523 somethings you read in there are written by a person who wasn't in touch with
524 anything, he was gone! plastered! wasted! however you want to state it. just
525 look at some of it. what a swaggerer of a guy you have there.
526 ^.^..^.^.^^.^.^.^..^.^.^.^.^^.^..^.^.^.^..^.^.^.^.^.^.^
527 .........................................................................
528   It just so happens that Ham Cutter has allready now conformed to this
529 system since his first entry.  He is now calm, rational, and he doesn't
530 make any claims of violece.  When I said that line about conforming, I
531 meant that he would act in a way acceptable to the others on this system,
532 which would happen sooner or later if he stayed on for a period of time,
533 or he would leave under his own free will.  That does not mean that the
534 person in question would no longer be an individual, just acceptable.
535 Sorry that you took that wrong, Mark.
536   As for religion, the attitude expressed above is immature, saying all
537 about organized religion being a scam.  It is very unlikely that the 
538 characters of the Bible did not believe in what they were writing.  It
539 is debatable whether the writing and their beliefs are true or not.  I 
540 would love to see a good ol' BWMS religious discussion.  I lean towards
541 favoring the teachings of the Bible, yet I am not so into it that I don't
542 have a open mind.  Go ahead sceptics, attack!
543 ............................. Andrew ....................................

545 
546 THE BIBLE IS A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN BY MEN. NOT GODS. A LOT
547 OF PEOPLE BELIEVE - BELIEVE - THAT THE WRITERS WERE DIVINELY
548 INSPIRED. THE WRITERS BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION WERE DIVINELY
549 INSPIRED. THE BIBLE, FOR THE MOST PART IS A GOOD BOOK, BUT
550 IT IS FAR FROM THE LAST WORD,THE ONLY ORACLE. THERE ARE OTHER
551 "BIBLES". IT IS THE PROSLETYZED INTERPRETATION OF THE(SE) BIBLES,
552 WHICH CAUSES THE BREAKDOWN, THE DIGRESSION FROM IT'S INHERENT MESSAGE. 
553 THE BASTARDATION OF IT'S TENETS THAT HAVE BEEN 'REWRITTEN' TO SERVE THE PURPOSE 
554 THOSE WHO USE IT, AND IT'S TEACHINGS FOR THEIR OWN END. 
555 THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH RELIGION. IN A WORD HYPOCRISY.
556 THE BOG BELIEVES GOD IS ON HIS SIDE. DITTO MOON, HUBBARD, THE POPE
557 AND A. HITLER. YES, ADOLPH WAS "DIVINELY INSPIRED". LIKE ANDREW I BELIEVE IT WAS
558 SAID ABOUT "ORGANIZED" RELIGION. RIGHT. RELIGION PER SE IS A PERSONAL 
559 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN INDIVIDUAL AND WHAT HE BELIEVES IN. SANS PRICE TAG.
560 SANS SUNDAY SCHOOL, SANS COLLECTION PLATE, AND WITHOUT "CORPORATE CHURCH OFFICES
561 ACCOUNTANTS, TREASURERS, INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE, OIL, ETC ETC ETC. CHURCHES 
562 HAVE MORE WEALTH THAN OIL, STEEL, THE AUTO INDUSTRIES,AND FORTUNES FIVE HUNDRED,
563 AND WHATEVER ELSE THROWN IN. THE TIME HAS COME FOR CHURCHES TO START PAYING 
564 THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. LIKE THE BOG, FOR ONE

566 Grizzly:Just how many subjects have you brought up for discussion?
567 I have never been to T.Salads`home.
568 The lie you speak of is however just that, it was a simple test to see just how
569 much Brian tells you folks. It worked well, the test that is.
570 I, at this moment, believe in no devine entity, so the J.C. quote means nothing
571 to me. Why don't you say things for yourself? I will judge people if I so wish
572 as it is part of my indeviduality. I am sure that most people do.
573 As for having no respect for peoples privacy, I never did call Mr.Forsyth
574 at all, he requested that I not, so I complied and cleared up the matter in 
575 another fashion. How I wish, hope even, that people would be able to remember
576 PorSFiS. thats how it is spelled folks! I am unable to attend the next one, but 
577 the one after I should be at.
578 And I am unable to understand "DWID CITY" at all, please explane it.
