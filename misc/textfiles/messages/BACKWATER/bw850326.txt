30     Time passes by, and even agents of fortune are not above the creeping
31 feelings of fatigue; the fatigue of a story line that has gone on too long.
32 The characters wish to expand their horizons, and explore new territories.
33 Sometimes this means ending something that is not finished, but the
34 necessity of change is greater than the need for completeness. The case
35 of the errant agent has been a long and enjoyable story to partake in,
36 but recent occurrences have made it difficult, if not impossible to
37 finish the story in the manner desirable to all concerned. Problems
38 arise in a multi-authored story that don't arise anywhere else. When a
39 key character looses access to a terminal, or must go away on a long
40 trip, the story can suffer from the loss. It is this point in the current
41 story the agents find themselves in. Rather than continue half-heartedly,
42 the agents who remain have chosen to start anew. Consider the current
43 NET story to have concluded as such...
44 
45         Kosta and Gaudy Minsky made it out of their predicament. L'homme's
46 plan worked well, up to a point. The only disappointment being the escape
47 of Fleming and several of his misguided followers. They were a force to
48 be reckoned with at another time. Farley performed well that day, earning
49 more respect from his new colleagues. He had far to go before he could be
50 called a senior agent, but he was making good progress. L'homme and 
51 Fellows managed to come through the ordeal unscathed for the most part;
52 nothing that a couple days in a NET hospital couldn't cure. In the
53 confusion of the fire (It is best not to cloud matters too much by going
54 into the fire) Kosta managed to slip away. His whereabouts at the present
55 are known only to him. Gaudy Minsky decided to take a few quiet days off
56 in her beautiful home town of Toledo Ohio. When and where she could pop
57 up is anybody's guess. L'homme, Fellows, and Farley returned to NET HQ
58 at Ione Plaza, where they received the chilling news of attempt on Ian's
59 life. Secretly, each of them could only smile inward when they heard
60 about how Ian escaped the assassin's bullet. After a few days rest and
61 relaxation for the very tired trio of agents, a meeting was set up with
62 Ian. The very one-sided conversation with Ian went something like this...
63 
64         "Gentlemen, I know you have had a tough past few weeks, but you
65 wouldn't be NET agents if you weren't up to the job. I realize that your
66 past few missions have been of the pursuit and retrieve variety, and that
67 you all may be getting a bit tired of it. Unfortunately, I must ask each
68 of you to go on such a mission once more. We have some loose ends to tie
69 up, and as you well know, NET doesn't like to leave loose ends dangling
70 around, only to be tripped over at a later time. Former NET agent KOSTA,
71 who made his escape on the mountain, must be returned to the fold. He
72 has knowledge of the organization that no living man who isn't currently
73 employed by us should have. We must have him back. Your mission is to
74 find KOSTA, bring him back to IONE plaza, alive if at all possible. You
75 know what to do if he resists. Until KOSTA is accounted for, he is a
76 security risk that we can not tolerate. Do you understand?"
77         Three heads slowly nodded to acknowledge their understanding. KOSTA
78 hadn't seemed like such a despicable person, despite what they had learned
79 from NET's history files. To bring him back, certainly against his will,
80 and to possibly kill him, would require a great amount of mettle. It is not
81 often NET agents were required to kill so close to home.

160 "Gee, it's cold out here in the snow with no clothes on!",  mumbled Jerzy
161 to his commrade, Pavl.  They had been caught trying to escape from the
162 gulaug the Russian bastards had sent them to.  Their captors evidently
163 found great pleasure at their discomfiture (and disrobement).  Jerzy
164 remembered the words of the Seargent of the gaurds: "So, you like to see
165 the outside world?  Maybe you like the feeling of freedom, of liberation?"
166 He regretted his haughty reply, "Perhaps you should spend some time out
167 here with us in the yard, wearing nothing but rags!"  So here they were,
168 wearing nothing at all.  He remembered the stories he had heard as a child
169 about the horrible experiments the Nazis had conducted on the Jews.  How
170 long could a soldier survive at the Russian front?  Since we can't spare a
171 soldier, let's take a Jew:  we have plenty of them!  Take his clothes off
172 and sit him out in the snow for 8 hours.  Observe him freezing to death.
173 What fun!  How long could they last?  He glanced at Pavl, who was already
174 turning blue, even though they had been exposed only 5 minutes.  Pavl was
175 sickly anyway;  this would surely
176 be the death of him.  Pavl was shaking so badly that he could hardly stand.
177 Jerzy put his arms around Pavl and sat down in the snow, cradeling his
178 brother in arms into a fetal position, and strying to trap as much warmth
179 as he could.  The cold was intense, but at least there wasn't any wind. 
180 The snow was falling softly, covering the camp in a soft blanket.  Pavl
181 began to sing softly to himself, or maybe to God, a hymn.  No, it wasn't
182 really singing, just a stuttering mumble.  Perhaps he was performing Extrem
183 Unction on himself.  After all, he was a Priest.  His political activities
184 didn't enamour him with either the Polish authorities or with their Russian
185 bullies.  It didn't matter now.  Jerzy took up the tune and the words in a
186 stronger voice, like a mother soothing a child awakened in the night by a
187 bad dream.  Jerzy began to feel warm.  He knew that this was the precursor 
188 of death.  Pavl was unconscious.  The life was draining from him, from them
189 both.
190    Suddenly, he was raised from his stupor by a sharp report.  He heard
191 voices and shouting men all around him.  Someone seemed to come into his

257 Subject: Robotics Section
258 Dear Sir,
259    I am sorry to inform you that one of NET's primary android manufacturing
260 sections, RUR404, is no longer operational.  It seems that the machinery that
261 creates the logic circuts for the AI unit inside such androids has broken down
262 due to heavy use.  Replacement parts HAVE been ordered, but the shipping
263 company told me "four to six weeks for delivery".  As you well know, what this
264 really means is that the parts will arrive sometime next year, if at all.
265    In the meantime, sir, the robotics department has asked me to request that
266 you refrain from utilizing valuable androids to provide an "easy out" in a
267 storyline.  A suggestion, sir, from the section's EMIL7000 AI managment unit
268 is to "write an appropriate reply to such attacks, preferably longer than 
269 three lines".
270                                  Respectfully submitted,
271                                  06.

339   The pegasus whickered softly behind him as the piper cautiously stepped
340 toward the large building.  The buzz of conversation sounded, briefly
341 punctuated with a burst of laughter.  The night air was cool on the piper's
342 skin, used now to the warmth of the highway, his feet noiseless in the
343 gloom, he strode cautiously toward what appeared to be a doorway.
344   Suddenly the door opened and a shaft of light sped outward, cutting into 
345 the darkness, accompanied by a wash of conversation and laughter.  A figure,
346 darkly shadowed by the backlight of the room beyond vanished into the night.
347   The pavement seemed soft and resilient beneath him as he stepped forward,
348 catching the door before it could close.  The sounds of conversation in
349 the room before him quietened as he stepped through the door.
350   The piper found himself at the top of a short stairway, standing on a small
351 landing overlooking a rather large room.  A large bright fire flaming in an
352 open fireplace in the center of the room provided most of the illumination,
353 added by candles and oil lamps on some of the more remote tables.  A familiar
354 scene to the piper, he started down the stairs.

358      When I return from work, 10 hours dealing with twenty-two adolescents 
359 with no social skills, I look forward to interacting with mature people
360 as a way of relaxing.  It seems logical to me that a BBS might offer an
361 incresed opportunity for people to think before they speak, and thus be able to
362 interact in a manner that is more diplomatic and less stressful than normal
363 conversation.  I find profound delight in the stories and poetry that inhabit 
364 this system.  I don't like everything on here, some people simply have not had 
365 the practice that others have, and don't do as well.  These we can support by
366 offering constructive criticism, not pulling their egos out from under them.

375 L'homme: Really, while it might be interesting to try to patch COPYLINK
376 to run on the 2000, I would suggest waiting for 3.0, which we can install
377 with REAL code. The COPYLINK you're playing with has peices of I/O 
378 stashed in various places. That is because I/O is VERY time dependent,
379 so I couldn't hold to the normal format. You'll find an I/O statement
380 at the proper location, but you will also find that it acesses ports
381 00H and 01H. This is used by the interpreter to do the actual I/O at
382 realtime speed, If you really do want to (good lusk) the code is located
383 near the begining of COPYLINK.COM there is an interrupt input routine,
384 and a poled output routine. Then you also have the initialization
385 routines at the normal locations in the COPYLINK.OVR file.

388 Mike: Message received. I will give it a try, and if it doesn't
389 work, we'll wait for version 3.0. COPYLINK is one of several Comm
390 packages we didn't get to work because of direct addressing of
391 the port from the program. QMODEM, and PCT660 were two others that
392 refused to talk to the modem. QMODEM is a real lose, since it offers
393 split screens for incoming and outgoing. But we really miss COPYLINK.

402 I am finding it very dificult to access this forum with any ease or regularity
403 any longer.  Prehaps I shall just have to attempt to survive this flurry of 
404 line distortion and over-zealous usage by those with less than civil tounges
405 or terminals.  Oh, I shall always return, that is not a question, it is just 
406 that too many of my friends here are experiencing a rise in blood pressure at
407 each other.
408 The odd thing is that my Legion and I will wait the delay of this "vacation"
409 and will attempt our struggle for greatness when time will allow us.
410 ^^^^^     (messages to follow, varied in tone and intent...)
411 THOR:  I think that the simplest location for an exchange of words might be at
412        the placed known as PCS.  Multi-person story-lines are fine and all, but
413        before more than one person can be involved within it, the basic premise
414       must first be formed. Kinda like what these NET people are talking about.
415       By the way, PaPa Smurf says you said "Hello"...  See you at the BBS...
416 kathyd:  Just a word of warning-  Some of these "jerks" are being offensive
417          only to see what sort of a response they can provoke.  Do not do what
418          I have done- allow it to pass on by, and make no mention of them.  If
419          you are to enter any more items here, there are quite a few that await
420          them with eager eyes.
421 WHITE KNIGHT:  I am aware of it, the name stuck out like a sore thumb. 
422                I am willing to be of help.  I am ready, and I have The FAITH!
423 Entropy:  I see that you have left the "battlefield" behind for more pleasant
424           things.  May your relationship stay in a good light!
425 MiG:  Hey buddy, boy do we have alot of work to do!  Call me at home at a
426       not so respectably dark hour (as usual).  A few points need clearing up.
427   
428 Hmmm...  Techno-dribble.  Where is that 'little one' when we are in need?
429 OMIGOSH!  I don't believe it!  I forgot THE TIN MAN!  How embarassing...
430 THE TIN MAN of multi-realities:  It seems that the last message I sent thee by
431     means of secret letter at that other system was to have been the last *I*
432     have ever seen.  There was no reply.  I have waited, and am still waiting.
433     Have I sent you away at the mere mention of a name or two?  Was that so
434     terrible a time in your life that I must be shut out by association?
435     Toby has my number... Prehaps I shall use his...

440 L'homme- In the light of current events, or lack thereof, I was pleased to
441    see that the situation is still not completely without resolve. Might you,
442    by chance, notice the disappearance of one of those critical pieces of 
443    epuipment known to some as a COMSET?  At least by my recognition and the
444    ability to deduce such things, I believe that I may have just stumbled upon
445    a treasure!  (Next assignment:  Retrieve and Edit history files for

449 Hmm, That's odd, I got home tonight, and the system was running, but
450 nothing was happening, That's odd I thought, So I put a phone on the
451 line to see if there was activity, and got a dial tone. Hmmm, now wait
452 a minute, the system thinks it has carrier, but there isn't any....
453 Very strange, that can't happen! carrier is what keeps the thing on
454 line! You have carrier, it holds the line, you drop carrier it drops
455 the line. This can't be! It appears the modem locked to it's own carrier
456 for some reason, but that doesn't explain why it wasn't still holding
457 the phone line off hook. It isn't supposed to operate that way, there
458 isn7t any electronics in there at all, it is just a capacitor, diode,
459 resistor network, all passive stuff. The ring signal charges the capactor
460 which causes the modem to answer the line when the voltage gets high enough
461 (the on line relay driver comes right off of the capacitor.) If it doesn't
462 recieve carrier within a couple of seconds, the capactor discharges
463 (because there is no more ring signal to charge it anymore) and when the
464 voltage drops below the threshold it drops the relay, and we go off line.
465 If we do get carrier, then the carrier signal is also feed to the same
466 capacitor, which keeps it charged up. So as long as there is a carrier,
467 the capacitor stays charged which keeps the modem on line. Lose carrier,
468 and the capacitor discharges, and about 10 or 15 seconds later it drops
469 below the threshold voltage, and the relay opens which takes us off line.
470 An exception to this is an activity monitor which forces the capacitor
471 to be discharged (an over-ride circuit that just shorts it out) if
472 there has been no activity for 10-15minutes. So, the question is, since
473 it isn't possible for the problem to happen, how did it? I'm baffled!
474 I forced the thing to disconnect, and it did, but why didn't the lost
475 carrier do that, or failing that, the no activity disconnect? 
476 Very stange things going on here....

525   As the piper walked slowly down the bannerless stairs, the hum of interrupted
526 conversations resumed.  Looking slowly about the room as he descended, he
527 spied a seat at a table with several jolly-looking folks not too near the 
528 center of the room.  Aware of his scrutiny, they had sent him several inviting
529 smiles, and the flutter of lashes from a lovely lady wearing a multicolor 
530 dress increased the piper's pulse rate considerably.
531   The stairs and floor both had the same strange resiliant quality, letting
532 the piper's feet sink in slightly with each step.  His stride was therefore
533 a rather strange combination of bold and cautious as he picked his way 
534 through the crowd to the welcome of a seat at the open table.
535   As he approached, a large hearty man got up to welcome him.
536   "Welcome stranger!  I am Koom Youlus, would you like ale or beer?"
537   "Ale, thanks," the piper returned.  "I am known as the piper.  Thanks for 
538 the welcome."
539   Koom grinned a bluff and fhearty grin and answered "Strangers are always
540 welcome here.  We are quite isolated and grow tired of our own company."
541   The lady in the multicolored dress slid slightly aside on the bench
542 to make room for the piper.  "Please sit with us," she said.  "I'm Rainbow."

555 WE who seek wisdom from afar are all too wise to know that wisdom could come
556 from some cold electronic purveyor of lighted words and phrases. Often the
557 case of those who would distill their apparent good will on others are merely
558 spewing forth a waterfall of inane articulations and verbage. WE must laugh
559 at those who think their creations have some meaning beyond the small confines
560 of this comfortable yet uncreative atmosphere. It is to those people who wish
561 greatness but may never achieve it, WE drink a toast to your efforts and your
562 expenditures, be it great or small. 'Into the valley the 800 rode.' So to is
563 the case here. Perhaps not 800, but the numbers are irrelevent. The destination
564 os of great import, and until it is reached, the numbers will continue to
565 ride without direction or purpose, only knowing for sure when they arrive.
566 What a consumable existance! Woe to the man or women found too caught up in
567 the happenings therein, where the reality of one locale often bends and
568 meshes with the reality of another. Just as certain elements found in the
569 earth should never be brought together, the elements of this world and
570 others too should always be separate and distinct. When the blur betwixt and
571 between them becomes so unlcear, the distinctions are impossible to make,
572 trouble lurks near, waiting to be set of by the person who's eqo perhaps is
573 a little fragile at the moment. The reasons are of no import. The results
574 should be taken seriously by everyone. WE are worried for the few who it 
575 seems are having great difficulty making the choices that seem so clear to
576 others. It may not even be their fault, just a lack of growing up. Maturity
577 is a two bladed sword. By the time one finally gets it, they are too old to
578 use it. This is not always the case, but it is more a rule than an exception.
579 Heed the warning signs. It is your inner self, the self hopefully not
580 corrupted by what the outer self must endure, pleading with you to partake inb
581 some self examination. Look yourself over. Look for the signs that mean
582 the inability to make separations from one reality to another. WE have been
583 observing this for sometime, and WE feel that there still is time to recover
584 those who have been lost. Those who have made the distinction can certainly
585 help. Aid your fellow user out of the plight. Show the light. Make the path
586 to certainty clear and unobstructed. The more you help others, the more you
587 help yourselves. You will find the teachers learning as much as the 
588 students. When all  is done, you may look back at the rocky path just
589 traversed, and wonder how you ever made it. Don't question the journey. Give
590 thanks for the arriving.
