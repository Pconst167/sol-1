 23 Actually, "transmissions" that consist of a generator-motor setup are quite
 24 common, and both efficient and reliable! Ever hear of a Diesel Electric
 25 locomotive? The problem is that the generator and electric motor weigh a *lot*.
 26 With the current work in high temperature superconductors, we can begin to look
 27 forward to the day when such units are small and light enough for use in an 
 28 automobile.
 29 The engine would run and a constant rpm & load. The generator would produce 
 30 electricity which would be run through control circuits to drive the motor(s).
 31 The control circuitry is the key. And it is well understood.
 32 (basicly it controls the voltage and current going to the motor seperately.
 33 Speed depends on voltage, power depends on current...)

 36 Efficient and reliable in those applications yes (you forgot submarines -
 37 though that technology is being displaced by nuclear power). And yes
 38 it does weigh a lot. 
 39 There is however a problem in using the concept in the standard auto.
 40 That is the need for a *very* wide range of power. The gas engine is
 41 more efficient in this application as it stands with current technology.
 42 Even with super conducting motors the gas engine is still more efficient
 43 in general automotive use. The reason is that the gas engine changes
 44 its usage of gas depending on demand. The constant speed approach 
 45 means that the engine always runs assuming optimum demand because 
 46 it must be designed to suppy power at that load level. 
 47 You could put in speed control, but then you get back to the same
 48 old problem and it becomes questionable if it is really cost effective 
 49 to add in the additional loss of an electric motor.
 50 Disel train and submarine engines are designed to run at a constant
 51 speed over most of the on cyle of the motor/generator. The sub also uses
 52 the engine to charge batteries so that it can run under the surface
 53 (engines eat precious air that you need to supply the crew with).
 54 That sort of approach might work with the auto industry, or possibly 
 55 get rid of the gas engine entirely, which would be better.
 56 Superconducting motors wuld probably put enough pressure on the
 57 battery makers to create a battery that could be used effectively
 58 and cheaply in the needed power levels. A breakthrougb in those
 59 two areas would revolutionize the auto industry. Until then, don't
 60 hold your breath. (On the other hand, with the continuing degradation
 61 of air quality.....)

 66 Actually, I started this discussion on the topic of making the gas engine
 67 more efficient. Now we are covering alternative fuels! 
 68      What is wrong with alchol as a fuel? It is already being used in cars
 69 anyway, and there are alcohol carbs available. Further gas commpanies are
 70 already mixing it with their gas. It does take a different engine compression,
 71 though, but some head shaving or mmaterial removal on current engine heads
 72 should take care of that.
 73    I myself prefer hydro-oxy mixes. Gasses are easier to store than liquids,
 74 and you could build a device that used electric power and water to manufacture
 75 hydrogen and oxygen in the home. Of course, that would destroy the 'gas 
 76 station' approach, but would be economically better for the society as electric
 77 power is easier to distribute.
 78    More efficient and lighter batteries have already been built. Plastic 
 79 batteries exist. The problem is that they are all more expensive than the lead 
 80 acid battery. Anyway, I reember seeing lithilum batteries available mail-order
 81 years ago for industry. But, it took ten years before you could buy them off
 82 the supermmarket shelf.
 83    Getting away from batteries what about the Super-Capacitor? Capacitors can
 84 deliver far higher surge currents than batteries, and current in an electric
 85 motor is what produces torque (and torque is what spins tires!) If we could
 86 produce a capacitor that would have a high enough power to space ratio, would
 87 that not be better than a battery?
 88    As far as the automotive turbo goes, bering failure is currently thought
 89 to be from lubircation problems, not due to rpm and heat. When a car engine
 90 that is turbo equipped shuts down the oil pressure drops immediatly, and
 91 the turbo takes time to wind down. What happens is that the bearings are
 92 not supplied with fresh oil during that time. The oil in the passageways
 93 in the bearing then 'cokes', clogging the oil passages. Eventually the turbo
 94 bearing oil passages are completely jammmed and the bearing then runs dry.
 95 What happens then is rapid wear-and the bearing material is torn apart, the
 96 turbine impeller off-centers and eats in to the housing. Blown turbo!
 97 Manufacturers are recognizing this problem and you will soon see electronic
 98 pre-and post oiling systems that maintain bearing lubrication and save the 
 99 turbo. they are already available in the auto aftermarket. Although, that won't
100 help current owners of turbo engines (Ha Ha Ha Ha)

105 ***back to Zig***
106     The king and queen, had of course, kept Zig's starlessness a secret.  It 
107 would not do any good to let the general populace know that their future king
108 was a no-star.  It was an insult.  So they kept the child in his nursery, 
109 alowing only their most trusted servants to care for him.  "A king  must be
110 protected"  they stated when questioned about the guards at his door.  And
111 so the people never learned about his abnormality.
112   Of course, the royal couple had secretely employed the best doctors,
113 priests, and wizards to see if the problem could be fixed.  The doctors
114 gave Zig medicines, and tried implanting  the star from an accident victim,
115 but neither worked. The priests prayed, and burnt inscence to the gods,
116 but no answer was given.  The wizards employed all manner of arcane and
117 occult rites, but nothing they did could make a star apear on the prince's
118 forehead.  After 2 years, the king and queen gave up.  Zig was sent to a
119 far away castle, with his teachers and servants, his toys and ponys, his
120 personal possesions.  He never knew quite why. The king and queen announced
121 that their boy had died of a fever.  Free of the responsibility of Zig, they
122 soon had another son, complete with star.
123      Zig grew up surrounded by teachers and servants, who took care of him,
124 and fulfilled his daily needs.  One could almost say they loved him.  But
125 Zig, a very sensitive boy, could tell that something was missing.  He had 
126 never seen his own reflection in a mirror, as the king and queen had not sent 
127 one with him, so he couldn't claim his lack of star caused his people to 
128 think differently- he didn't know he had no star.  All he know was that 
129 something was not quite right.

141 Ted: The main problem with "fuel grade" alcohol is that it tends to absorb 
142 water like a sponge! And a lot of common plastics are at least slightly
143 soluble in it.
144 As for Hydrogen/Oxygen, they can't be stored practically *and* safely on the
145 scales needed. The cylinders for compressed gases are too heavy, and an
146 explosion hazard. The liquified gases are better, but even in liquid form
147 Hydrogen is *light*. It'll take up a *lot* more volume than gasoline for the
148 same energy output. (ie gallon of gas can be burned to release X amount of
149 energy. A gallon of liquid Hydrogen produces a lot less. I seem to recall
150 1/10 or 1/20 as much.) On a pound for pound basis it is superior, on a gallon 
151 for gallon basis, it is vastly inferior.
152 And then there's the Liquid oxygen in your scheme... A LOX spill is *dangerous*
153  on asphalt paving it is equivalent to a mine field! The pressure of a person
154 walking can detonate it. (In some coal mines they experimented with a 
155 rather interesting blasting compound. Drill the hole, pack it full of *cotton*
156 saturated it with LOX, and detonate as usual. Somewhat more powerful than
157 dynamite....)
158  
159 And the problem with capacitors is that they want to discharge *all at once*.
160 Not the kind of discharge curve you want for powering something.
161  
162 Batteries are probably overdue for a breakthrough of some sort...
163  
164 What we really need is something like Heinlein's "Shipstones" (named after the
165 inventor). A "black box" that is capable of storing electrical energy on the
166 order of Megawatt-years in the space of a suitcase. And releasing it at a
167 constant voltage and reasonable current.

169 The lythium battery is the only real new thing in the battery industry 
170 for some tiem, and it is not anything new. The main thing that had to
171 be overcome was packaging. When abused they have this nasty habit of 
172 wanting to explode. To be released for general use that little bugaboo
173 had to be delt with. I suspect that if batteries are going to be used
174 in auto that they will have to be built along the lines of a fuel cell
175 where a liquid is the component that gets used up. 
176  The failure of a turbo due to overheating the bearings is not a new
177 thing it has always been known, and there have been continuous efforts
178 to reduce the problem. Chrysler took the approach of water cooling the
179 bearings which goes a long way in dealing with the problem. But the
180 first line of prevention of the problem is with the user. The primary
181 cause of the problem occuring is shutting the engine off immediately 
182 after heavy use. The engine should be left idling and/or operated at
183 low power level for several minutes to give it a chance to cool down.
184  The "shipstone" concept is a nice one, and the power companies are
185 dreaming of just such a thing with visions of superconductors in their
186 heads. Their desire is to provide surge isolators so that when a high
187 surge user comes on line it doesn't pull the rest of the grid down.
188 It also is being looked at to help even out the power drain on the
189 grid. So that when everyone comes home at 5pm and turns on the heaters/
190 airconditioners (depending on the time of year), ovens and such that
191 the power won't sag significantly. As it is now they have to try to
192 anticpate the need ahead of time based on past usage and have extra 
193 power on line during those times. With a superconducting storage ring
194 they wouldn't have to worry about switching substaions on and off line
195 all the time. The ring would store power during light load and let
196 it back out during heavy loads. That is what they hope, but whether 
197 it will actually work or not is another matter. First they have to
198 be able to build an operational storage ring, and that is a few years
199 away since they have to figure out how to use the new superconductors
200 first. At least we know that the new superconductors work and can
201 do the job. It is currently up to the materials engineers to find
202 ways to produce them in easily usable form. 
203  The really intreaging thing about the new superconductors is that
204 *anyone* and make it. All you need is something to gind the material
205 into a powder, and a oven to cook it in... and of course the recipe.
206 One scientist said that he used a coffee grinder and a microwave
207 oven. I can hear the mothers across America now.. "You're making WHAT!"

210  
211 To the user who imprint line 132 with "God licked my brain", this
212 may also mean something to you:
213  
214 It is right to rebel when they paint over your graffiti!
215  
216 Apparently you too use the Ross Island Bridge to get from point n(1) to
217 point n(2) as well. The most interesting things can be found on the
218 walls of those approaches.
219  
220 Two things come to mind. One is mere trivia.
221 1)Did you know that the ramps connecting SW Front Avenue to the bridge-
222 the west approach-have official street names? I found the following on
223 a plat map of that section:
224  
225         The ramp that takes you from SW Arthur St @ SW 1st Ave or from
226         SW Front Ave to the bridge eastbound is called:
227                          "SW Ross Island Way"
228  
229         The ramp that takes you from SW Front Ave northbound to the bridge
230         eastbound is called:
231                          "SW South Way"
232         And the ramp that takes you from the bridge westbound onto 
233         SW Front Ave southbound toward SW Barbur Blvd and Burlingame
234         is called:
235                          "SW Bridge Way"
236  
237 This plan strikes me as silly. As though someone would build a house there
238 and then desire an address. The preceeding fact is spurred by the reason that
239 I am incredibly obsessed with maps and draw them at every opportunity. I even
240 have drawn an 8'x8' map of a large section of PDX of which I am rather proud
241 (toot my own horn will I?)
242  
243 2) And speaking of Ross Island, did you know that there are two mutually
244 exclusive things there? one is a gigantic colony of blue herons, and if any
245 of you followed the news you know that Portland's official bird as of about
246 eight months ago is the great blue heron. This is a good thing as they are
247 beautiful magnificent things that Rosaria posesses more of than any other
248 city on the Left Coast. Or either coast for that matter: I understand you 
249 just dont find those bird in cities. So this is a good thing, yes: a thing
250 that shows how wonderful and enlightened this city is though?
251    Not necessarily. Let me introduce you to the other resident of Ross and
252 Hardtack Islands:The Ross Island Sand and Gravel Company.
253    For a long time now, at least 40 years, this company has been digging 
254 up Ross Island to get aggregate. If I could show you historical aerial 
255 photos you would be shocked:is anyone aware of the current geography? The
256 two islands pincer a lagoon. This lagoon was absent in years past:only a 
257 narrow strait separated the two, which were both lush and thick with the
258 forest that you can see from the Baldock Freeway (I-5) and the Ross Island
259 Bridge. It is now gone, except for the shell which now exists. And if that's
260 not bad enough, the city has actually for years wanted to make them a park.
261    And who do you suppose stood in the way? Three guesses and the first two
262 dont count. And of course there's the herons. And the fact that when you 
263 travel south out of the city on McLoughlin Blvd, that in the 4200 block
264 you have this unattractive view of a cement plant and not a wonderful forest
265 sweet islands and a river.
266    Yes, I admit that I may not have the whole story. That perhaps the comp-
267 any's attitude may have changed. And yes, I am aware of the city ordinance
268 that requires Ross Island to replace the aggregate that they have picked
269 up with an equal area of land.
270    But then I am cynical enough to know the attractive force of the "$".
271 and the fact that the people who own the company have lots of money and
272 probably want nothing more than to make more, damn the nice islands and
273 the forest and the herons.
274    And even if they do replace the land in kind, Ive seen earlier pictures.
275 You cant make up for what theyve taken out of there. 
276    Think for a minute. What if when crossing the Ross Island Bridge, one
277 day next century, you looked off the side and saw no reason to have that
278 bridge have that name?
279    I do all the time. And especally the herons.

320 MILADY MUSE:On the subject of graffiti, I most certainly do understand
321  the logic and purpose, which I may add I endorse wholeheartedly. The point
322  I was trying to make was that the graffito (singular of graffiti, which is
323  in reality the word for a collection) was silly, so silly in fact, that 
324  the point was lost. The viewer is lost in laughing at it, not getting the

326    Put it to you this way. If you are going to rebel, dont be a fascetious 
327  dolt and tell everyone, "Hey, I'm going to rebel!". Just get out and do it!
328  In the above context, the artist would have better served his purpose by
329  doing some fantastic masterpiece, so good that the gray paint surrounding 
330  would have looked like the useless suppression it in fact was.

357 WHO CARES
358  
359 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
360 Yes alchol does absorb water, that is what 'Dry gas' is. I usually run a can
361 of it thru my tank every so often..
362 What about a 'breakthrough' on the solar cell. I have heard current estimates
363 that a stock solar cell gets only about 10% efficiency. If they were produced
364 with a 90% efficiency then we might be able to mmake a reasonable solar car.
365 Also, did anyone see the movie 'planet earth'? (I think it was called that)
366 about a year and a half ago? They had in the movie a device that transmitted
367 power that planes could tap into, thus never needing to refuel.  I believe
368 at one time Tesla built a tower that he could get to transmit electricity
369 over a half mile distance. Would there be some way to directly transmit
370 electricity to a car? 
371 Also, it is weight that takes energy to move, not size. Granted, you would not
372 need to carry oxygen if you directly vented it to the atmosphere when you
373 produced hydrogen, but a car with the current range of cars today would be
374 bulky indeed. But, what if it was designed to be refueled every night?
375 I too think the future lies with the fuel cell. It is true a liquid is
376 safer in an accident than a compressed gas, but experience has shown people
377 don't really consider safety much when they buy  car anyway. Otherwise, we
378 would be up in arms over the accident rate.
379 The best system for cars in the future seems to me to be this- alcolhol 
380 combined with a fuel cell. Fuel grade alcolhol does present storage problems,
381 but those have been solved by the Indy race teams a long time ago. I 
382 imagine too kinds of cars, Internal combustion alcolhol burning sports cars,
383 with plenty of torque and wheelspin, and weenie ass fuel cell econo boxes,
384 powered by a fuel cell decomposing alcolhol and driving electric motors.
385 The only real problem is the manufacture of alcolhol in the quantities needed.
386 I cannot imagine the demise of the internal combustion small block V8, 
387 unless someone gets wise and invents an electric motor with high starting
388 torque. 
389     Possibly we could make alcolhol out of coal, and use up our coal reserves.
390 That would really give the enviornmentalists something to scream about.

392 Well now, lots of stuff to respond to..
393 Mikey: Anthor "battery breakthruogh" that is relatively recent is the sodium-
394 sulfur cell. It is not suitable for mobile installations because it operates at
395 high temperatures (both the sodium and sulfur must be liquid). This leads to 
396 insulation problems and to real hazards if a collision ruptures the battery.
397  
398 Ted: another problem with the LH2/LOX system is that it takes more energy to
399 produce them than is recovered by burning them. And it *always* will. (The
400 three laws of thermodynamics strike again)
401 As for solar cells, they will help on a house, but *cannot* run a car! Assuming
402 100% efficiency, there is roughly one horsepower per square yard of power 
403 available in full sunlight. assuming a car is around 10x30 ft gives us 33.3
404 horsepower on a bright sunny day. It won't sell. (note that the surface area
405 of the car isn't what matters, it's the surface area of a rectangle
406 perpendicular to the sunlight whose shadow will enclose the car).
407  
408 Sunlight is insufficiently concentrated to be a major power source.
409  
410 Actually, we should revive the various steam car designs that were once in
411 use. They only produce CO and unburned hydrocarbons if improperly adjusted
412 (and unlike a internal combustion, the power settings for high power are
413 also those for low pollution). Due to the way they work they don't stall out
414 under a sudden load. They also accelerate more smoothly (which saves wear on
415 tires!) They accelerate a bit more slowly, but what do you expect from a 70
416 year old design! The one problem they have is that they take a long time to
417 warm up. This can be avoided by merely leaving a "pilot flame" burning to keep
418 the steam up. This would use maybe a pint of fuel a night...
419  
420 I'd love to find out how DEQ would handle a car with a steam engine. I'm sure
421 that you could get a Stanley Steamer engine built by a Benson student fairly
422 cheaply, and it shouldn't be too hard to mate it to the drive train of a normal
423 car. Anybody know if the DEQ emissions rules specificly mention "internal
424 combustion" engines? 
425 (if so, we're home free, a steam engine is *external* combustion!)

427 Actually, Mr. Lear (of Lear Jet fame) threw away a lot of money trying to
428 make a modernized version of the steam engine. He finally gave up on it.
429 The primary problem he ran up against was lubrication. He tried all kinds
430 of things and never solved it sufficiently that it would work for the 
431 100,000 miles we currently expect out of a gas engine. The old stanleys
432 never had to work that hard. The train engines did well, but they operated
433 at *much* slower speeds which allowed the water itself to act as the 
434 lubricant. To make the engine small enough to work in a car you have
435 to spin it faster to get the power out of it, and that means you run
436 into lubrication problems. I seriously doubt that you would only use
437 a pint of fuel to keep a head of steam in the engine. It would have to be
438 extremely well insulated, and even then I have serious doubts. 
439 Of course if gas as a fuel were to disappear things would change.
440 The last gas shortage gave us a taste of what would happen. For better
441 or worse, you can bet on alcohol as the replacement fuel. This is largely
442 due to it being reasonably compatible to existing engines. With a little
443 bit of tweaking on the engines and with the fuel it can be made to work.
444 Since we can't change all the cars and other engines in use overnight,
445 or even in a few years, the only real alternative is to adapt to a fuel
446 that can be used on existing equipment. Propane would be an alternate
447 choice, but it usally is related to oil. So if the oil were to go, you
448 probably would see propane go as well. Alcohol can be made from a variety
449 of sources and so has a lot to go on for that. The problem is that it
450 steals from food sources when you make it. Especially in the quantities
451 we're talking about to run the world. More land cleared of forests to
452 produce fuel plants, more land laid waste through unrelenting farming.
453 Not a very plesent consideration, yet it seems to be the primary
454 alternative fuel source given the current state of things.

604      Reality is a cultural herresy.  Cultural orthodoxy is NOT realism,
605 ain't never been, ain't never gona be, period.
606      It is however a basic reality of any pre-civilized culture, such as our
607 own, that the martyrdom of cultural heritics is a favorite passtime of
608 rioting mobs.  Such is life.
609      This is not a product of random chance nor of a puttatively melign
610 universe.  There is a mechanism.  The enculturation process, weather parrental
611 institutional or peeral, perpetuates an emotionaly vested interest in the
612 cultural status quo.  Any too overt attempt to attune oneself with reality 
613 is perceived as a threat, at least some of the time.  The collective beast
614 (society) reacts to these threats, by one way or another, attempting to 
615 eliminate or at least neutralize them, with great enthusiasm.
616      The person who can maintain contact with reality without stepping on

668    If we manufacture alcohol in the quantities needed by rotting land biomass,
669 then we will indeed steal from foodstuffs. But, what if we use the oceans?
670 Would it be possible to manufactore alcohol from some species of plankton?
671 Certainly in the tremendous number of species in the oceans there is surely
672 one or two that could be genetically engineered to produce alcolhol directly.
673 I think alcohol would bee a great boon to the survivalist types, you can 
674 always set up a still in your garage, and if you make to much to gas your car
675 you can always drink it! (just a joke)

691 Nothing new there, tey periodically have offered superchargers and
692 turbochargers on their cars. It is one of the forst things that
693 auto manufactures offer for speed freaks because you can get such
694 a dramatic power increase by tacking the beast onto the engine,
695 better then any other add on. Of course you pay for it both in the
696 increased cost of the option typically $1000-$2000, higher insurance
697 costs (insurance companies get panicky when they see the word turbo..
698 particularly if it is your only car), and maintaince costs. 
699 But if you want POWER! It is the first place to look.
700      Alcohol burners... Yes it is possible to obtain it from the sea.
701 The only real problem is the ability to ramp up production by farming
702 the sea. It would take about ten years to gain the needed volume.
703 And of course it could very well take longer if the enviornmentalists
704 jump into the fray, because sea farming in that quantity is very much
705 going to radically alter the sea in the areas where the farming is done,
706 and that means whole species will be wiped out because conditions will
707 change. If they really push it could be 20 years or more before it 
708 could be acomplished. The farming land methode is more familar, and 
709 the equipment and knowhow to do it is already there, that is why it
710 would natuarally shift in that direction. These sorts of things always
711 move in the direction of least resistance.
712 But if we do end up on alcohol, it woul be nice to use the sea for that,
713 but it will take some time to build up a system around that sort of thing.
714 Keep in mind that it toke decades for the oil based economy to reach
715 the point where it is now. It takes a long time to break that inertial.
716 That's why any change will come slowly and will try to follow existing
717 methodology where it can.

743 *********"I just don't know, my friend. I don't know where we're going to
744 get it."
745     The dark haired man threw up his arms in resignation. For the third time
746 in as many hours he shoved his hands in his pockets and dejectedly walked to
747 the window which overlooked the Willamette River and the east side of the
748 city. 
749     "It's as I told you, Dorn. Well have to make an expedition to one of the
750 old sites. At least to identify the deposits if there are any. This place 
751 never had any real industrial hives before the war, and even if we are getting
752 ahead in manufacturing replacements its still a while before we can make our
753 own stuff."
754     "That's true. But so much of the scrounging is bringing back dirty, hot 
755 stuff. All we want is to build a dome over Portland, and if people lose thier
756 lives doing it, I would much rather it be from something we can prevent, like 
757 falling several stories."
758     "I hear you there. Well try to stay away from the Seattle and Frisco 
759 strikes, even though the biggest leftovers are still there. But I cant guar
760 antee. We cant build the frames out of Doug firs you know. The raw materials,
761 we just dont have. We dont have mines, we dont have furnaces, we dont have 
762 mining equipment, we dont have this, we dont have that. And everything is
763 contaminated. Even The Oregonian...what there is of it anyway...is active."
764     The man at the window didnt move, but something in his bearing indicated
765 concession of some kind. 
766     "Okay. But only if we really have to. I mean it." The man at the window
767 turned to look at his partner. Pain showed in his eyes. The torture of the
768 knowledge that he'd ordered 40 people to thier deaths at Bremerton to try
769 to salvage some of the Naval yards there still showed plain after two years.
770 It was plain he wasnt about to take anymore chances if he could.
771     But he could see that maybe it was necessary sometimes.
772     Raw materials were needed, and they had to go to the world Outside to get
773 them. Iron for beams and struts. The plastics could be made anywhere, even now.
774 But Oregon was short on the metals. These were best availible near the old
775 destroyed cities, as either parts from the few undamaged factories or parts
776 of the blasted buildings. The best source was of course, Seattle and Tacoma-
777 Seattle had been hit but not directly, destroyed as a course of the unit that
778 detonated over the Trident base. Tacoma was better-She wasn't really hit, but
779 deserted-but being a smaller place, was soon exhausted. Frisco Bay was good
780 enough, but was quite far away, and it had to be reached by boat-the South-
781 erners around Medford werent letting anyone go by. It would have been so easy
782 to use the old Interstate 5....
783     They needed to build a dome. One which would be ten miles in diameter,
784 covering the central city of Portland, and a few smaller ones for the cities
785 about. It could be done. The engineering was not hard. The parts were in such
786 short supply, it could be damn discouraging.
787     But if it could just be done then finally they could filter out thier 
788 environment and at least live without having to worry about consuming so 
789 much poison. The air could be recirculated and purified, even the Willamette
790 could be filtered and treated. Food would be grown underground, and would be
791 clean and good.
792     And someday the dome could be taken down, someday whan the world Outside
793 wasn't so hostile. The sun would shine uninterrupted. 
794     But until then, this had to be done. 
795     For what seemed to be the millionth time, the two looked up above the
796 office entry to a bit of whimsy that allowed them to accept the task theyd 
797 chosen. It was a sign that was done in old fashioned script, the kind youd
798 find in an old advertisement:
799      "The Pettygrove and Burnside Geodesic Dome Construction Company"
800      They both sighed. No mored

822 and now a bit of story (this one has many
823 pages prewritten)...
824 *=*=*=*=*=*=* of the closing of the hidden lands *=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
825      Part 1: a new land...
826      Shedjey, as he came in time to be called, learned if alternative switching
827 at a raw nerved, tender and sensitive age.  Though he has yet to recall the
828 name with which his parents gifted him at birth, he suffers no such loss
829 as to how he first came to know streingeness.
830      It was one of those sunny, cloud castle days in early autum.  Sheji was
831 eleven and a half going on twelve.  If there had been no more to life then
832 the quality of the weather Sheji's contntment would have been complete.
833      He had missed the only school bus.  Unlike his peers whose parents all
834 owned cars, some even with cars of thair own, Sheji would have to walk.
835 This mnt he would entirely miss his first period class: u.s.history.  A loss 
836 for which he would shed no tear.  Unfortunatly he hadn't been doing too good 
837 and today was the big test by which he might have been able to salvage some 
838 hope of a passing grade.  Second period was P.E.  If history was an 
839 unpleasantry, phys ed he positively loathed!
840     In the small rural high school sheji attended he was known as a letch and
841 a wimp.  Thanks to the overactive glands of puberty at least partialy, it 
842 was a reputation of which he wass not entirely undeserving.  His few friends 
843 could be counted on the fingers of one hand, indeed there were those who would
844 say they were.  Not that any of this bothered him all that much, he had long
845 since aquired familiarity and even a digree of preferance tword solitude.
846      The walk, though long, was by no means unpleasant.  He might have greatly
847 enjoyed it had there not been further complications.  This afternoon, in the 
848 multipurpose gym, the county health department would be giving small pox
849 injections.  To be excused would require a signed note each from parents and 
850 an ordaned protestant minist
851 This much credit he allowed himself: never had he made a production over this 
852 major anxiety and minor pain.  This was more than could be said for many
853 of the more 'macho' of his peers.  His father had told of similar experiences 
854 in the army twenty years before.  Still, all the childhood propiganda to the 
855 contrary, it did hurt.  Maybe not mumuch but certainly not not at all.

862      Anxiety turned Shedji's lower leggs to lead and lent density to the very 
863 air.  Without realy thinking about much except to be wishing he were someplace
864 verymuch else, he stepped through it, bang into a wall of stone he'd a sworn
865 hadden't been there a moment before.
866      Dazed, he looked about to find himself inside some sort of enclosure. 
867 It was roofed but not well.  The sky, through broken rafters and missing
868 shingles appeared just as before.  But the smell - oh the smell!  Sstale horse
869 dung, straw and several more subtle spices, none of them familiar.
870      A loud angry voice was impenging on his awairness.  Belatedly he reaalized
871 it was being addressed at him.
872      "i don't care if you'r playing with yourself or just daydreaming..."
873      It was fallowed a moment later by a face, red with anger entering that
874 confined space.  That it bore even the slightest resemblance to that of his
875 own father was a detail sheji realized only much later.
876      "you're gonna learn" it raved on "when I tell you to do someting I mean
877 do it and I mean now!"
878      This gentle's build was half again what by all rights it should have 
879 been and in his right hand a short whip of no ambiguity as to purpose.
880      Leadden feet, of thair own accord, carried Sheji tword the nearest exit,
881 almost quick enough, almost.
882      In one breath all movement was arrested by a ham sized hand vice gripping 
883 Sheji's shoulder.
884      For one pannicked instant the tableau held crystal clear, the next
885 was plunged into absolute darkness.
886      The angry nearby hiss, of a cat-like quality, a LARGE cat-like quality,
887 told Sheji he was not quite as alone as he might have preefered.  Still,
888 at least this was nature.
889      Unlike one's fellow man, who are known on occassion to go a rather long
890 way out of thair own way for the sole purpose of making themselves obnoxios,
891 the world of nature tends to have sound sensable reasons for almost everything
892 it does.  
893      Here Sheji would stay, at least for a while.  Still the slight mattter of
894 fur fang and claw would have inn some manor to be reconed with.
895      Sheji held the case of his ffrench horn in front of himself as a shield.
896 Remarkably it was still with him.  
897      Band had been one off his good classes, the one he could count upon for
898 A's or at least B's.  Most likely this was due to his spending rather a
899 great deal of his time in practice.  This may be credited to its calmative
900 effect in his otherwise anxiety ridden existance.
901      Momentarily puzzled, the cat pawed tenatively, claws half retracted,
902 at Sheji's right hand, yhe one holding the instrument casses handle.

906 however more ross/ whatever island, trees and all and less of hole in it
907 would certainly have been more desirable.

927 Greetings to the folks of Never, Never Land (or whatever name you 
928 decide upon), and to all the inhabitants of the Backwaters.
929 This is Cheryl Singer.  
930 Justin: Good to see you in such company, old friend.  Your story
931 looks very good so far.
932 On Alcohol as a fuel: My suspicion is that alcohol would take very
933 little of anything away from food production.  Remember, as long as
934 it isn't for drinking, it can be made from just about any garbage.
935 How much spoiled food, paper, crop chaff, etc. does this nation 
936 throw away, anyway?  I'll give you a hint--the figure in millions 
937 of tons per day would probably be substantial if you add up all known 
938 sources.  Production at the same scale as gasoline would be much
939 cheaper due to lower overhead, materials, and transportation costs.
940 There are two things holding us back from making use of alcohol as a 
941 serious replacement for gasoline:  1) The inertia of the system--a
942 major problem with any alternative (as opposed to new) technology,
943 and 2) the fact that large potential producers would face a great 
944 deal of competition--from the customer!  When people find they can
945 make their own cheaply and easily, the large corporatios are going to have
946 a hard time keeping afloat.  Nice job for those of us who 
947 appreciate decentralization, but not for the people who would need
948 to invest in making the initial cahnge on a large scale.  
949  
950 Therefore, I suspect that such a change can only happen bit by bit,
951 as individuals change their own patterns.  That is the only way we can 
952 overcome the inertia of the status quo.
953  
954 Thanks for listening.  Enough rambling for one session.  Cheryl

956 I mentioned the possibility of home alcolhol production earlier only as a joke.
957 I think that you will find that the vast majority of people will have neither 
958 the space, time or required amount of biomass to produce enough alcohol to
959 run a tonka truck.  Oh sure there will undoubtedly be some farmers or so that 
960 will never need to buy alcohol, but when you consider the technical problems
961 of purification, and the trouble of setting up and keeping a still going, I
962 think you will find that it takes industry and the economics of scale to make
963 alcohol 'cheaply and easily'.  After all, as I mentioned earlier, Holley carbs
964 already HAS a carb available specifically for using alcohol on a street 
965 machine, and has had it available for quite some time. And the engine mods for
966 booze burners are simplistic, to say the least. Any cylinder head shop could do
967 it. If it was so easy to make alcohol and use it as a fuel, then why have not
968 people been running out and DOING it already?
