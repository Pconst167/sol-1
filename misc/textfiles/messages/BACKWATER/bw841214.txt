24 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     The Young Master West     Episode III
25             ...new faces and a chance to rest...
26      Upon my entrance only a few eyes turned my way as a man by the hearth 
27 raised his voice as he stood.
28      "All rise as we give tribute to our unthanked friends!"  At that, he and
29 all the others turned my way. 
30      Shortly, as blush came over my face, I realized that they were not looking
31 at me, but at the man that was passing by me as he came out from behind the
32 counter of The INN.  The impression he gave as he passed by me was that he
33 weilded far more power than any but a few of these patrons had ever conceived.
34 Yes, he was special to them all.  I guessed that this must be the Innkeeper
35 himself by the looks of the slightly soiled white band of cloth about his 
36 waist, now his band of office.
37      I didn't know very many men that were much older than my brother, except
38 my father and my instructors, but from what I was able to learn from them--
39 what they taught me as well as what they didn't know they taught me, I could
40 just tell that the smile on the Innkeepers face was for the benifit of the 
41 others, and was an attempt on his part.
42      By the time the Innkeeper had made it to where he could feel the warmth of
43 the fire, his smile had changed from an attempt to a pure reaction for the 
44 close friends at the head tables had out-numbered his expectation.  For that 
45 matter, The INN was almost the fullest it had been in a long while.
46      The young Master West did not really recognizeany of these people, but it
47 was very obvious that the rest knew each other  as compliments and comments
48 were being exchanged by some that are known as Bard, the Piper, some that 
49 called themselves 'The New Creators' and , yes, even Pam had managed to stay
50 with the crowd although a bit reserved now by her embarassment of her last bold
51 statement. (No, under the conditions, I wouldn't call it an 'outbreak')
52      The atmosphere had truly lifted in the short time since he had opened that
53 door. Now he felt that he could rest unnoticed for a while until he was able to
54 make his way to the one person he had recognized and ask him for direction in
55 solitude.

77 NET 1: Fred is an experimental prototype, therefore is entitled to make 
78 mistakes (as I am entitled).
79    The winds buffeted my therm suit as I hiked towards the wreckage.  I had 
80 only travelled half of the way when I heard a signal from Fred.  "Beeeeeep.
81 Farley?"
82 "Yeah, Fred, what is it?", I asked.  Hmmm. Maybe I could test the XD-40 on
83 that tree over there...
84 "I, er, made a mistake.  That helicopter is carrying an ELT, not a coded 
85 signaller.  Wait.  The ELT has been switched off."
86 I listened to Fred through the chronocom as I took aim at the short pine.
87 "Any other activity, Fred?"
88 "No.  Shall I continue scanning?"
89 I thumbed the button that the manual had named, "Thermonic exicter".  Instantly,
90 the tree was aflame.  "Yes, keep scanning, but don't tell me about the huge
91 heat source near my position."
92 "There's a... what?  You don't want to know about it?"
93 "Forget it, I started it.  No activity at all?  No reason for me to continue?"
94 "Scanning full 360... no, none."
95 "I'm comin' back.  Look for a good place to stay in the book, time to hit the
96 sack for awhile."
97 I started back.  Suddenly, a thought came to me.  Turning around, I aimed again
98 at the tree.  This time, I lightly pressed the "Thermonic dampener".
99 "Smokey the Bear says, never keep a fire going..."

120 Petrov: That's the best writing I've ever seen you do. Either
121 Mohammed has reclaimed his character or your writing has
122 improved tremendously. Whatever the case, your entry was
123 excellent. I was very impressed.
124 
125 I'm tempted to jump into one of the adventures but I've just 
126 taken a temporary job working with the Childrens Services 
127 Division. My time and emotional energy are so wrapped up in
128 dealing with rapists, child molestors, and abused kids that 
129 I haven't much energy left for Backwater.
130 
131 I was considering opening a topic for debate but the quality
132 of the fiction is so good I can't bring myself to break the
133 flow. I think Backwater has entered another of those periods
134 when the quality of the contributions is outstanding. Keep up
135 the good work. I only wish I had the emotional energy to 
136 join you.

146 something up and let us be the judge.  Don't let a few negative comments
147 deter you.  There are some here who get their jollies by cutting others

149 you might astonish yourself by what you can achieve.

154 from what I've seen of your input so far, it has been quite good.
155 You may be feeling down right now, but writting something can help
156 to make you feel better. And if you get some praise, just think
157 how good it will make you feel. So please do write something, I
158 would very much like to see it.

162 The Innkeeper looked around the Inn one last time. Where could she
163 have gotten to? What could I have done to chase her off? She's no
164 place to be found. Not in the back room, not hiding in a corner, 
165 no place. Pam, what happened? Where are you? Sigh....
166 Dejected, the Innkeeper stepped out of the dark curtained room he
167 had been checking. He spotted a small figure hunched in the far 
168 corner of the Inn. Moving over to see if it might be Pam, he found
169 it to not be Pam, but recent new customer he had seen hidding for
170 sometime in the shadows. Tammy I believe her name was. She seemed
171 to be a bit saddened over something, in fact the redness about her
172 eyes was probably due to crying. "Excuse me, I couldn't help noticing
173 how sad you look. Would you like to talk about it? Sometimes it can
174 help. Besides, I could use someone to talk to since Pam seems to
175 have disappeared on me again. Maybe between the two of us we can think
176 of something to cheer each other up." The Innkeeper settled down
177 in the ricketty old chair (Blast! where is Pam to keep these things
178 in order!) heaving a long sigh, he turned to look expectantly at Tammy.

182 Tammy: I notice that you seem to be having a bit of trouble with your
183 border. ('[' instead of '{' ect.) You might try the following
184 to make it a little easyer:
185 
186 enter all the same character like periods
187 ..........
188 then change them with the change command to {c}
189 ch /./{c}/
190 this is what most people who have fancy borders do.
191 To put your name or a special note, just mix it in with the periods
192 ......{Tammy}...{hi!}..
193 Hope this helps to make it a little easier.

221 On a serious note... when you say 'I have a story, but it's not good enough so

250    Tumbling slowly in the absence of gravity, wings awry, the pegasus came 
251 awake with a scream of pain and terror.  The reflexive stroke of her wings took
252 her away from a winged orange and black terror, fangs and cloaws and a lust to
253 kill wrapped up in a body of nearly her own weight.  The carnivore had much
254 shorter wings (not needing to support it's body weight against the pull of
255 gravity.  The stroke of the pegasus' wings brough a flash of agony to her
256 side as the pull opened a great slash the carnivore had torn in her side.  A 
257 quick glance around reassured the pegasus that she faced only one attacker -- 
258 it seemed to be a solitary hunter like the jungle tiger.  It gathered itself,
259 bunched its muscles, and launched itself at her with outstretched claws.

262 I opened my eyes.  It was hard to focus for a while, but soon things didn't
263 look as fuzzy.  I was in a room, obviously some motel from the look of the 
264 towels imprinted with "Holiday Inn".  Thinking harder, I remembered that I had
265 checked in late last night.  I slowly rose, shaking the sleep from my head. 
266 After a brief shower and a change of clothes, I was ready to hit the road 
267 again.  I hoped to find some sort of trail to follow.  I decided to forget 
268 about the cat... looking at his picture, he didn't look as if he could be a
269 threat to anyone, unless he unleashed his fleas.
270 That left this other guy... 'Brother Joshua'.  No, wait, just 'Joshua'.  Better
271 leave off the 'Brother' part until I knew just how he felt about my employers.
272 I still didn't know if he was a runaway or had just wandered off from his 
273 friends.  Maybe a trace on his past would help.
274 I locked the room behind me and gave the key to the main office.  Fred had 
275 parked himself near the swimming pool, probably to do some "observations". 
276 John, I'll get you for this screwed-up computer car of yours.
277 "Hello, Fred.  What can you find out about Joshua?  Anything at all.  We're
278 out of leads."
279 Fred was quiet for some time, so I got in and began to find some place to eat.
280 "Nothing at all, Farley.  There's no record of him."
281 "Nothing?  Are you sure?  You goofed up on the ELT.  Try again."
282 "Still nothing.  Hey, put his picture to my screen and I'll try to match it."
283 I held up the photo to the CRT, feeling acutely foolish.
284 "Give me some time, Farley.  There's a lot of pictures I'm going to have to 
285 sift through."
286 "Ok, you do that while I'm eating."  I dialed a combination on the keypad and
287 the CRT revolved back into hiding.  I pulled into a Burger King and ordered.
288 Driving off, I began to eat.  Fred still hadn't finished, so I pulled into a
289 parking lot to finish eating.
290 "Farley, I've got something.  This Joshua person has a strange past.  I keep
291 running into a three-letter combiniation in his file."
292 "So, what is it?"
293 "PIV.  I keep finding PIV.  Mean anything to you?"
294 "No... Run a check on that too, will you?  Run a battery of decryption programs
295 and try to crack it.  Anything else?"
296 "Yes, an address in Portland.  Shall we drive there?"
297 "You work on PIV, I'll drive."

313         (The  following  is an unpaid political  announcement.   Campaign  speech  for 
314     treasurer in 5th grade class, 1969.)
315         Fellow Students and Teachers:
316              I want to outline my campaign platform.  First of all, I am in favor of a 
317    two-party system.... one on Friday night and one of Saturday night.
318              In addition, I am very good at multiplication.
319              I  pledge my efforts in working toward fiscal responsibility,  a balanced 
320    budget,  a reduction in taxes,  truth in lending,  and the elimination of  the 
321      gold drain.
322              I  dedicate  myself to the opposition of high interest  rates,  galloping 
323       inflation, and the exploitation of child labor.
324              It is NOT my intention to criticize my opponents but...  we must  examine 
325    the record.
326              Do  you want a treasurer who would try to fix the gold drain with  Liquid 
327     Plumber?
328              Could  you  support  a candidate who would try to stop oil  depletion  by 
329         cutting of its ALLOWANCE?
330              Will  you vote for a treasurer who thinks a bad check is an Evil  Eastern 
331       European?  Of course not!
332              And in conclusion,  I promise that if elected, I will treat your money as 
333     if it were my very own.  Thank you.

340   I admit it, I am finally in bed after a lot of insisting by freinds. It seems I am in the least bit ill.  I will endeavor to
341 make the best of it though. I will muddle through somehow, and being waited on hand and foot will help a bit.
342 
343   Man in Gray; Helga and Shiela were in the mood to thank you when they got up, I don't know how long it will tqake for that
344 stuff to wear off, but I would not want to be around when they come to their senses.
345   Now here's a wild thought, maybe they really did enjoy all those 64 games after all...
346 
347   Sondargaard; The Revolving Key might simply be an stimulating exercise for our minds to dabble in. Sharpening processes of
348 deduction, and as you have found, altering previous assumations. I am infull favor of this latest turn of events.
349   About the Latest Parcell, I have been checking up on your progress for quite some time, and I have discovered no note. I
350 might have missed the blasted thing, so I will check again as soon as I get out of this Deathbed they have me in.
351 
352   Kathy; I guess I am supposed to refer to you in lower case from now on, but I am not sure, so I will not dispense with using
353 the uppper case denotation on you name.
354   I challenged you to a game of pente some time ago, and received no reply. My way of dealing with this was to go 'Boo Hoo'.
355   That is what you missed, not much was it? Anyway, what about pente at the next PorSFiS?

359   Omega slipped the pistol into the creaky leather holster after feeling it's weight. Getting adjusted to the pistol.
360   He placed the pith helmet on his matted down hair, matted by the sweat and dampness of Louisiana bayous. He slid the helmet
361 strap around his chin and lifted one wet boot out of the murky swamp Omega was using for ground.
362 
363   All of his clothing was wearing away, rips had formed along his shirt from where the branches had slashed him. Punishing him
364 for not carefully sweeping them aside.
365 
366   His canvas backpack with all of his provisios was getting stained with the all the concoctions finding their way in and out
367 of his single pot.
368 
369   Lifting boot after boot, step after step, Omega waded through deeper water every meter. Finally with murky scum coated water
370 engulfing him to his neck, the water stopped rising.
371 
372   Omega dared not go further in this area, he looked up at where the sun should have been. All that was there were tall moss
373 covered trees, rotting with dry rot. Omega followed their lengths down to the ground.
374   The devil's vines were wrapped around the trees at their large roots. Smaller vines and brambles found home there.
375   Many briar patches seemed to form the only land for kilometers around. The moss collected on them and after twelve or so
376 years silt and mud would attatch themselves to the submerged roots. Forming ground after a few years.
377 
378   Omega checked his wrist chronometer, it said he was at a heading of 234 mark 15 and it was just past twilight. Night was on
379 the aproach, and Omega ought to make camp before the night came, before the animals awoke.
380 
381   Omega selected the thickest trunk he could find, and dragged his sopping wet self onto the mossy ground. Pulling with effort
382 Omega arrived on top of the floating island of moss.
383   This one was stable and large. Briar patches had made a small hutch for him. The moss was not even infested with that many
384 mosquitos, and all the mosquitos in this season seemed to be males anyway.
385 
386   Males still drained their portion of your blood but they did not poison you with the venom that itches your skin, and smears
387 it red.
388   Dripping the flamatory fire starter he had bought at the caygen store, he staked some briar sticks on t and lit it all with
389 a single match. Soon a fire was blazing red, licking at the tree tops for there was no sky.
390 
391   As Omega sat and watched his fire scare swamp animals, he thought about the moss, how it did not burn but simply stiffened
392 against the roaring flames.

397 The Cast of NET by Bob Woodward (part 4 in a 7 part series)
398 
399         Our story continues with NET agents L'homme and Gaudy Minsky barely
400 escaping with their lives from the RAINdeer commune, after completing what
401 they considered a successful mission. Rajneesh Dangerfield was dead, or so
402 they thought. In actuality, Dangerfield, who was a big fan of World War II
403 movies, a love for which which predated his involvement with Hollywood drug
404 addicts, stole the plot from a movie entitled, "The Eagle Has Landed", and
405 hired Guy Pinkly, an out-of-work Portland actor, who shared an uncanny
406 likeness to the guru. 
407 
408         Poor Guy, it turns out, was the victim of the NET assassin's bullet,
409 a fact that eluded NET intelligence, until Ma Prem Rivers told the world
410 of the diabolical plot against her beloved leader. The effect on NET was
411 crushing, and the once famous group of super spies, who were credited with
412 the defeat of Leroy McKane, a man who needs no formal introduction, fell
413 into disarray. One member of the elite group, a man known to the outside
414 world as Joshua, was captured by the Eastern Oregon cult, and presumed
415 killed. 
416 
417         Recent intelligence paints a different picture though. According to
418 one of my closest sources, who in this series of articles will be called  
419 Abysmal Gullet, rumors exist that Joshua may still be alive. If these
420 rumors are true, there is little doubt that NET will regroup, if only to
421 rescue their colleague from whatever trouble he may be in. Actually,
422 papers uncovered by fellow columnist Jack Anderson and his band of waste-
423 basket sniffing hound dogs claim that NET is planning more than a simple
424 rescue mission; they are re-arming and re-hiring for a full scale mission
425 against an as-yet-undetermined foe; a mission to commence as soon as the
426 true fate of Joshua is determined, and the appropriate actions taken.
427 
428         Whatever the case, there is no doubt L'homme sans Parity and Gaudy
429 Minsky will be key players in future actions of NET. It is known that the
430 two were deeply affected by the supposed loss of their friend and fellow
431 agent, Joshua. L'homme was quickly ported off on another mission for a
432 separate arm of the government's intelligence family, and the whereabouts
433 of Gaudy are still unknown at this time.

440                Government Accounting Service & G.S.A. Internal Memo
441  
442 Dr. Ragen,
443 
444         In regards to your recent letter requesting additional funding for
445 the resumption of full-scale operations of NET, and after consulting our
446 top analysts on the subject, we have agreed, in part, to your proposal.
447 
448         With the cooperation of the SEC, several high yield government bonds
449 have been secured in the name of Natural Egyptian Tours, a front company for
450 NET, with all monies earned from said bonds to be deposited in a secret non-
451 Swiss bank account, accessible to any cleared agents in the employ of or
452 as acting liaison for N.E.T. aka NET.
453 
454         In the meantime, while waiting for the bonds to mature, a 200 million
455 dollar stipend will be made available to N.E.T. immediately. Repayment of this
456 will be expected within 90 days of the completion of NET mission 1, as you
457 requested in your original letter.
458 
459         As a stipulation of this funding, NET mission 2 will be defined by
460 our office, and we will expect your full cooperation on the matter. The
461 details of said mission will be relayed to you at later date.
462 
463         We hope you find our terms acceptable. Please welcome Ian and his
464 fine staff back.
465 
466                                                 Sincerely,
467                                                    Phil D. Coffers

469   Oh, so it's like that is it?  We had a deal like that back in Instanbul, I never did want a peice a that one, and I
470 dont want a peice a dis one eider.

473 Thanks for all of the encouragement...  I still don't know what I am going
474 to do.  Sorry if my last message was a little offensive, I was really depresed
475 and I still am but...  I was going to upload the story so-far but I tried a
476 little test and the first couple of characetrs were gone off each line.  I'll
477 have to figure something out.  
478 Cistop Mickey: thanks for the help on the boarder and, um, are you also the
479 inkeeper?  If you are you were right about my red eyes, I did get the keyboard
480 a little wet.
481 My story may or may not be good enough but if I don't start now I never will
482 so I better get myself in gear and get going.  A regular kick in the pants
483 is a shorter way to put it.
484 I've got my slippers and hot coco and my sweet music now, I shall try to get
485 me all back to normal in a while.  After a good cry, about a week.
486 I'm realy sorry for the mess that I have caused here, this was probably a
487 very sweet system before ol blundering tammy arrived.  I'll try not to keep
488 the image "I've got a secret but I'm not telling you!" thing, maybe I'll write
489 my usual "bed time for Tammy."
490 I'm feeling a lot better now, I called an old number and the guy there has
491 been really nice.  I wrote my story onto his system and he said he liked it
492 a lot.  I don't know if he was just being nice but he has helped a lot.
493 well, I better get going.  Thanks again.

497      A  sharp  gust  of wind billowed the dark  cloak  behind  a 
498 figure  slowly  walking down a road boarded by  a  dark  forest.  
499 Shivering,  he quickly grabs at the cloak to wrap it more closly 
500 about  him  against the chilling wind.   It was hard to  believe 
501 that it was barely a year ago that he had first encountered Emer 
502 on this very road.   So much had happened since then, after only 
503 a few months of a whirlwind friendship, she had disappeared once 
504 again  down  this  very same road.   After that  he  had  become 
505 remorse,  and  his anxiety over her disappearance had turned  to 
506 panic.   Franticly  searching the countryside,  he was unable to 
507 find  her.   His  remorse turned to selfpity which he  tried  to 
508 drown in alcohol,  but as always, it just floated to the surface 
509 again.   Finally,  not able to live with himself,  he saught the 
510 peace  and isolation of a mountain cave to try to come to  grips 
511 with his feelings.  After a period of time he had come to accept 
512 the  loss,  but  the  desire and hope remained.   Now  he  found 
513 himself  heading  back  towards the Inn.   Drawing  him  like  a 
514 magnet, he was not sure what power it had to do this to him, but 
515 he  accepted the direction it presented.   Night came fast  with 
516 the approach of winter,  and soon it was growing dark.   A quick 
517 search  and Tarn found a sheltered area behind an outcroping  of 
518 rock.   Settling  down behind an old log to get out of the  cold 
519 bitting wind, he built a fire to try to warm his hands and feet.  
520 Watching the flames lick and curl at the twigs and rotting  logs 
521 he had gathered, his thoughts drifted.  What to do, his life had 
522 been  completely  changed  by the happenings of the  past  year.  
523 Desires  and  feelings had been opened which he had not  had  to 
524 deal  with  before,  and now they won't go away.   What  to  do.  
525 Looking down,  he found he had torn the leaf he had been  toying 
526 with into the shape of a heart.   Yes, the feelings still remain 
527 after all this time.   Pulling the hood of the cloak up to cover 
528 his head,  he settled down to get some sleep.                    
529                           *O* Tarn *O*

549 Bedridden! Dear me, I never would have imagined that. And you said you were 
550 well. I should have believed the msg. although with MiG's pointer, I am now 
551 finding it difficult to determine which fact is not. Could it be that the 
552 illness that has overcome you has affected the fingers with which you hold 
553 your pencil? The very fist word in what appears to be a heading to your note
554 is rather illegible to me. A new point (here): If you would like, and if she
555 concents, prehaps you could have the Lady S. or another friend become your
556 PHANTOM, either giving them instructions, or letting them try to figure out.
557    It seems that Nature has given Chronos a word to delay our being
558 mano-a-mano once again. Things have a way of working it out, I shall not worry
559 for I know we shall all meet again.     Ich halte wieder.

580 As I was reading the early edition of the Sunday paper an article caught
581 my eye. The interesting point concerned the fact that the building code is
582 being used as a political tool in eastern Oregon. My surprise was that it
583 made me remember that I live in one of the few classes of permanent dwelling,
584 where one has the freedom to create a personal living space, without the
585 interference of building codes and their enforcement. Perhaps it is one of
586 the factors that drew me to dwell among these last bastions of freedom!

591 Is GROUP du JOUR still comprised of Daniel C., and Bo & Paul P.?
592 I have a copy of the tape they released called 'TRIPLE ENTENDRE'
593 I didn't like it when I bought it, but maybe I'll dig it out and give it 
594 another try... Do they have another set of songs to release?
595 If anyone is interested, you can get a copy at the 'Time Out to Relax' store
