21    "Hi Pete", said the elegant, smiling figure approaching the gate, "you seem
22 somewhat concerned today. You must have been looking in on the mortals again.
23 You shouldn't let their foolishness get you down."
24    "Look at that would you. When they can't find anything actually wrong with
25 the believers and what they are doing they make up innuendos and slurs. As an
26 example see the story about the guy trying to escape through the snow. See how
27 ignorance and prejudice walk hand in hand. Why don't you just reach down with a
28 lightning bold and zap their..."
29    "Hold on now Pete, are you going to stoop down to their level? Perhaps you'd
30 like a little tour and refresher course down there on the planet. You must
31 remember that good does not exist by itself, it is complimented and completed
32 by the bad. If they weren't allowed to follow a course of free expression how
33 would I know when true devotion was being expressed?"
34    "But how will other people know them for what they are?"
35    "Oh, those who have their eyes open will know. There are plenty of clues.
36 As an example look how they use up resources without any consideration for
37 others. You may also see them strike back with vile whenever anyone questions
38 their actions or motives. But don't judge them now, there's still hope they
39 will 'see the light', if not you'll have your chance when they arrive here at
40 the gate. Wish them peace, joy, and understanding. It is the season you know."

46 Hi all! still on the prowl for a cheap BW TV set! Somebody must have  one
47 in an attic someplace, quick way to make 15-25 bucks.
48 Theus: didn't you get the Wintermute report?  hum, I will send it over via
49 our driver. It will show you just how bad we messed up on that project.
50 35 seconds was all it took, then BLAM! h-bombed the whole mess. I still 
51 have trouble believing that 16 members survived. I here they tracked one
52 down to some place called "Elk" or "deer" perhaps "antilope" was it. the guy
53 runs a religious commune. Calls himself Ragdish, or Hashish or rajneeshe, 
54 something like that. Anyhay, I think Idaho is going to be a wipe job
55 on one of the 16. I would like to know just how we are going to do this when
56 they are rumored to be unkillable. Maybe SALOG is going to give us short nukes.
57 I know, fat chance. I *WISH* we didn't have to go up against one of those
58 hyper-normals who managed to survive the worlds first h-bomb. If they wern't
59 so damn smart! I think we are going to get religion after Idaho and go become 
60 followers of this Ragdish fellow. I just know what SALOG will think.

90 I awoke from my short nap and shook the drowsiness from my eyes.  The distant
91 singing of carolers drifted in my door, changiing the atmosphere within from 
92 merely dull to downright depressing.  Not everyone was happy at Christmas time.
93 I unfortunately numbered among those people.  It must have been those people 
94 who asked for me to take their case.  Called themselves... damn, I forgot.  
95 Anyway, they wanted me to investigate some missing persons from their cozy 
96 little group.  Only if that was their only intent, why did I discern the bulge
97 of 44s underneath their clothes?  Why ask me, the cheapest detective in this 
98 part of town, to do the job when the could obviously (judging from the size of
99 their Rolls) afford much more expensive  help?  It didn't figure.  There was
100 much more to this than they were telling.  Being the curious type (and a little
101 sort on cash), I accepted.
102 Well, enough thought wasted.  Time to buy some quality equipment.  Good thing
103 there's a 'plus expenses' section in my contracts.  Funny, those people didn't
104 seem to notice or care.  Anyway, new car, state-of-the-art stuff from my 
105 contacts (it helps to have friends working at military installations, enough 
106 money and you could get ANYTHING), and pay the rent.  A detective's work...

112 No, positivly no way for that to happen. Go with it, it reminds me of what

200   The sound of the doors closing in that circular elevator shaft had a kind
201 of chilling finality that kept the little party from speaking for some time.
202   The piper noticed that the walls of the shaft shone with an oily sheen.  When
203 he reached out to touch the nearest wall, the smudge on his fingers caused him
204 to exclaim "but it IS oil!."  His knees began to buckle slightly with the
205 force of the elevator's rise, and he noticed with some astonishment that they
206 seemed to be standing on an unenclosed circular platform, speeding up the 
207 elevator shaft like ants on the point of a bullet.
208 ppppppppppppppppppppppppp
209   The pegasus shook her head fretfully, and rose to her feet.  She bent her
210 head and inhaled the odor clinging to the bagpipes, then searched the area 
211 again, following the piper's cooling scent to where it disappeared.  In general,
212 animals have very little time sense, but the pegasus was concious that a very
213 long time had passed.  Her concern was growing, and the piper's abscence was
214 causing her enormous emotional pain.
215   Students of the mind have identified three primary portions of the brain that
216 perform most important functions.  The inner core is concerned with personal
217 survival.  Here, the autonomic fuctions of the body are controlled -- digestion,
218 heart rate, breathing -- the essential minutae of keeping the machinery running.
219 Above and around that, is a layer of more complex construction that seems 
220 concerned with emotions.  This area can override the lower area.  Known as
221 the limbic area of the brain, this system gives the depth and flavor to our
222 life -- the color and scent of rage, the overwhelming fires of consuming 
223 passion, the peace and tranquility of requieted love, and the unendurable
224 pain of separation.  In man, a third area is highly developed -- the cerebral
225 cortex, site of the "higher functions."  Here mathematical theorums and 
226 computer algorithms fight for survival with cynical political manuvering.
227 Financial manipulation, organized war, and the microprocessor would not be
228 realities without the facilities of the cerebral cortex.  In fact, the mind
229 of man has been described as a man riding the brain of a dog riding the brain
230 of a lizard.  Our most hidden motivations, the selfishness and tendency 
231 towards self-gratification come from that lizard-mind deep within us.  Our 
232 nobility and treachery stem from the emotional level, while our intellectual
233 triumphs spring from the top.  Each level is able to overrule those levels 
234 below it, but not to sdestroy those impulses.
235   The minds of animals (at least of higher mammals) consist of a different
236 mix of these impulses.  The limbic system is predominant, with only a thin
237 layer of cerebral cortex.   They are fully ruled by emotion, and only through
238 emotion do they reach their full potential.
239   No amount of reason can explain why the pegasus somehow slipped her head
240 inside a loop of cord between two drones of the pipers pipes.  They slid down
241 her neck to nestle safely near her chest, resting smoothly as though placed
242 there by plan.  Reason does not explain the determination with which she 
243 gathered her strength and leaped into the air, mighty pinions buffeting the
244 morning breezes, nor the speed with which she left the ruby valley.  What can
245 explain the ease with which she located and began traversing the aerial 
246 discontinuities in reality that we earthbound creatures are but dimly aware
247 of?  Only a small white feather twisting down in the morning air remained
248 where the pegasus had kept her vigil.

258   Omega finally lifted his head, after a long struggle for consciousness. Denying that he had ever even fallen. For they would
259 never make it out of the forest if he did fall. Everything rested on Omega, and he was hard pressed never tofail that.
260 
261   Eventually, after letting his fragile neck try to move his weighty head, he realized they could not be in the snow.
262 
263   The floor of the helicopter? Perhaps, but how did he get there? Maybe he had only lost his memory of what happened to him
264 after he fell out of the tree. Might he have carried the neeshie to the chopper?And could he have set the ELT, and started the
265 heat?
266 
267   And judging by the way were pivoting, we're in flight, or maybe that's my...
268 
269   Klank! Omega lost consciouness again, perhaps for the best, as he would need to be rested for he rest of the story, which is
270 still to be told later. Now, go to bed Kiddies.

274 Voyeur:Thanks for leaving early. I got to PCS about 9:00pm, only to hear
275 you had departed like a scared rabbit. Being the helpfull person I am, I
276 broke all land-speed records trying to get there before it was too late,
277 but to no avail. The PAUG meeting was quite lively, and although I had
278 some troubles with the disks, determination and more than a passing
279 knowledge of false track/sector ID schemes helped pave the way to a
280 successful juncture. Now that I have these disks to give you, along with
281 a printed copy of some short story I picked up along the way, perhaps I
282 ought to bring them over, just like olden days...Naaa. Forget it. The

307   Omega lifted one eyelid, then another. Suprised that this didn't hurt, he got ambitious and tried to sit up. Once those were
308 attended too, he tried to make sense out of what he was seeing.
309   At first, there was just a test pattern of sort, which focused into a game show and telivision later. Looking about the rest
310 of the room had him beleiving he was in a hospital.
311 
312   After wondering what had happened for a while, he tried to find the ATTENDANCE REQUEST button on his life support panel.
313   Life Support panels don't have casual ATTENDANCE REQUEST buttons, they do however have off buttons. So he ended up turning
314 it off. Which scared the poor Nurse on duty out of her witts, as the life sign indicator went dead on his room.
315 
316   She dropped a clipboard and sprinted to room 2401 in record time, signalling two orderlies, and one full fledged doctor on
317 the way.
318   As the team entered the room with about three carts and five people, they all saw someone wearing a hospital gown, hitting
319 the Life Support Panel, muttering that it was obvious he wasn't dead, so why did it insist on indicating he was?
320 
321   The Nurse couldn't help but laugh, as it was funny as hell, and adrenaline surges are best worked out with laughter when
322 exercise isn't possible.
323   Turning around to find who was laughing at him, he saw all the gear that he recognized as life support equipment and a few
324 gigling attendants.
325 
326   After they had all calmed down a bit, the Nurse informed him that a Mister Machinery had brought him, and one other man, and
327 soonafter left. Any request as to clothes, or messages from Machinery were rebuffed by saying that he wasn't yet fit.
328 
329   One time, he had offered, in jest, to prove he was fit to the young girl, at which point she started gigling hysterically
330 again, and promptly left.
331 
332   After two days had passed, and sadly, only two sponge baths, he was fit for active status , as his chart termed it. Finally
333 he got permition to go visit the Neeshie he had tried to save.
334 
335   The door to 2145 was left standing open, and sheets were being taken off the bed, the room was being cleaned. Eventually he
336 found that the Neeshie was moved to civilian facilities as soon as consciousness was expected.
337 
338   Finding his way to an elevator, he entered the correct numbers for his destination and started wondering again, for the nth
339 time what had happened out there. What happened to Carmichael?
340 
341   Finally the door opened, and he stepped from the elevator into the newly plastered halls of the Nets new headquarters, as he
342 passed door after door, he began to despise the new headquarters. Finally reaching the last doors, he stepped out and into the
343 dontown Tri-Met offices, and left under the tall fountains the net had placed as microwave conduction refractors.

345   Stepping on brick after brick, each enscribed with a name, he remembered all the trucks that had excavated 25 levels of dirt
346 and soil to make way for Net central. Right under the crooked noses of the Portland City Commision, and the City Council.
347 
348   As he crossed 6th street, heading for Meyer & Frank, he wondered what anyone of these people would say if they knew that
349 under their feet, one of the most powerfull intelligence organizations on Earth was probably discussing whether they live or
350 died, and whether they knew what they knew or not.

354   Kinda slow going tonight, folks, but never fear, things will get better. I proved
355 that this night by calling small BBS and finding an intelligent person on it, which
356 is rare for that sort of bulletin board service.

372 L'homme: The following is a bug report...
373   I've downloaded your file SUBADV.100 from the Model 100 SIG database. I
374 encounter a syntax error at line 3010 when I try to wake the crew (while in
375 possession of the smelling salts). The line reads:
376   ...ANDIT(35)=-ANDL=28...
377   I believe that there should be something after the minus sign. 
378  (he goes on to say he dowloaded the program twice using xmodem, and to
379 thank us for a great program.) 
380    So, L'homme, could you check YOUR listing & I'll check mine. OK?
381 ______________________________Leonard_______________________________________
382 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     'bout time...
383      I didn't really have that much time to spare, and being here in the first
384 place would be cutting it a bit close if I wanted to hop a lift on the Orange
385 Turtle, but being the impulsive fiend that I can be on occasion, I decided to 
386 risk it. I dropped off my tote bag with a buffoon at the front door and 
387 received a battered copper disc in exchange for my precious time. Now, having
388 kept the note that would replace the one currently residing in peaceful 
389 co-existance with dozens of books on the arts and scores of books on any type
390 of literature, I headed immedeatly for a text concerning the HOMERIC GODS, and
391 ran headlong into amusement and a degree of dissatisfaction.
392      After I had zoomed up the steps, and raced through the doorway, I turned
393 the last corner to my destination. There was one problem, though: How do you
394 secretly exchange one private message with another in such a way to be CRYPTIC
395 when you stumble upon the receiving party desperately shaking books upside down
396 and sideways searching the nine corners of the universe for that same message?
397 Answer: Try not to trip over your jaw (which has just hit the floor)
398 realize what you've done, keep going, and never admit defeat.
399 I really did it now, I got caught off gaurd (gaard...) once again. Oh, sure,
400 I could have taken my time pretending that I was actually looking for a book
401 down that aisle, but who takes their time when in a rush?
402 There he was, shaking that poor book into oblivion, when all of a sudden an
403 intruder appears out of thin air standing in front of him with a note just
404 like the one he was looking for.
405 ^^^^^
406 Well, now that introductions are out of the way...
407 Hawthorne:  Did you go to the JBC to try to contact me Friday? If you had, you
408   would have found out before now that you couldn't, I had an assingment to go
409   to India of all places. You remember me telling you about India don't you?
410      It seems that my supervisor will be rather upset to find out that it 
411   wasn't just a trip to give a hand, they want me to transfer to their company
412   *permanently*, I think I will. They offered a contract with an increase
413   in my 'commission' and an increase in assignments also... I may be in hot
414   water for a while, but I think it's worth it...
415 Prometheus:  Life can be amusing at times, can't it?  By the way, I've seen some
416   fragments, and I can tell you, yes, HAL 9000 is 'alive' and well! It's great!

447   I am waiting for the final oblivion of courtesy, when Dune premiers. On that dark day, all will be stirring, milling masses,
448 grouping at Pioneer Square. Cults will rise and fall, and thousand will receive personal lobotomies by Frank Herbert himself.
449 
450   I do not wish to be told how awesome either Dune or 2010 is, unless I can cause serious pain to someone afterwards. I don't
451 know why I cosider it a mortal sin to rant and rave about movies, using inside quips and quibs everywhere. But I do consider
452 it the mark of an easily pleased moind. No one should be put into that much utter satasfaction by any spool of plastic.

458 Leonard & Mikey: I waited from 8:13 to 9:00, and then gave up.  I was extemely tired
459 from a long day at work & school, and by 9:00, even if you had shown up (leonard),
460 I was too burned out to enjoy it.  So, I left for home and bed. (Missing Leonard & L'homme by 5 minutes, of course).
461 It's just as well for both of you, though.  Ask L'homme what happens to
462 such occasions when I am around.
463 Mikey: you seemed deeply engrossed in a conversation with others, and as I
464 am a poor conversationalist anyway, I let you off the hook.
465 L'homme: flushed with the confidence of success from Zork I, I eagerly
466 attacked II.  So far I have 10 points, have died once, and managed to figure
467 out nothing of consequence.  Oh what masochists we mortals be at times.
468 All: I saw 2010 last night, and would be interested in the feelings of anyone
469 who sees it who has NOT read the book.  I saw 2001 before I read that book, and
470 enjoyed it a lot, although the book subsequently cleared up a lot of details
471 (like what that light show at the end was all about).  Having read 2010 first, though,
472 I had certain expectations about the movie, which were unfortunately not met.
473 The relationship between the Americans and the Russians was completely different,
474 the Chinese were written completely out of the movie, and other minor details
475 were modified in the interests of visual excitement.  Objectively I cannot rate
476 the movie; my views were colored (coloured?) too much by the book. 
477 So, what do you 'virgin' viewers feel about it?
478 Leonard: where were you?  I expected to see you there.  How about Dune,
479 want to make a group of it?
480 Oh, by the way, we got to the Eastgate at 7:30, and the show started at 7:45.
481 There was no line, and there were still a fair amount of seats left.
482 (not choice ones, but still, the theater (theatre?) wasn't full.  Hope Dune is like that.)

485 Hmmm, Christmas is getting nearer.  Mother just bought a Microwave oven yesterday and is so excited about the thing
486 that she wasted no time irradiating our breakfast this morning.  Guess she just HAD to play with her new toy.
487 L'homme; ever see a book entitled 'Mapping the 64'?  It sure would have come in handy when we were trying to figure out
488 those ROM calls.  'Every significant memory location in the 64...'
489 Mig; If you can tele-communicate with a 64, you can use ANYTHING.  Kinda like learning to drive on a stick-shift.

491 Piper's sudden shout stirred me from my thoughts.  Well, let's see.  If this were a normal elevator, there would be 
492 a brief increase in our weight as acceleration brought us up to a constant speed.  The elevator had been moving for 
493 about a minute, and I still felt a larger-than-my-share weight.  Ergo, we're accelerating.  Following the Piper's 
494 as he pointed upward, I discovered that we were in a tall shaft of some sort, being pushed upward... to be crushed?  I
495 didn't like the implications of that last thought.
496 Opening my bag, I scanned it quickly to find something to extract us from this new situation.  Ah!  Of course.  
497 "Can anyone chip the floor a bit?  I only need a little piece.  And Doctor, somewhere in that hideous-looking scarf of
498 yours you have your Sonic screwdriver, don't you?  May I borrow the power source?"  Maybe a little binding could help.
499 Leonard managed to get a small piece of metal off the floor quickly, and The Doctor handed me the tiny atomic supply 
500 from the 'driver.  I pressed the two together, and mumbled the words necessary to effect the binding.
501 "Er, excuse me, but could you please tell me what you are doing?  I really don't know what is going on.", L'homme asked.
502 "Well, one of the principles of magic is 'like produces like'.  This piece of the floor is about 1/2000th the size of
503 the floor itself.  I have re-bound them magically.  Now, anything that happens to the floor", I pointed downward, "will
504 now affect the piece of metal."   Sure enough, the shard was moving up without any means of support, but at a very slow
505 rate.  "In addition, the relative position of the shard is tied to me, not to the ground below as the floor is."
506 "But how does that help?", L'homme asked, puzzled as ever.
507 "Because it works in reverse, also."  I grasped the shard gently and everyone felt the floor begin to slow.  
508 "Anything that happens to the shard will now happen to the floor, but on a larger scale.  I must be very care ful and 
509 lift it at a rate that is more suitable for us."  I was relieved to find that my magic wasn't as rusty as I thought.
510 "Shall we proceed anew?"

515   Omega picked the small handset off the pay phone, and waited for the dial tone. Once recevieved he dialed Emanuel hospital
516 and asked for the Neeshie's room number. Once he had that he hung up, deposited another quarter, and called his own apartment.
517 
518   It was a mistake, the type often made. Instead of dialing the intended number, he had entered his own apartment's instead. A
519 very simple, easily corrected mistake.
520 
521   He was about to put the receiver back on the hook, when he thought he heard someone answer. Putting it up to his ear, Omega
522 asked if anyone was there.
523   "yes, I am still here, who may I ask, is calling?" The other man said in Omega's voice, and manner. Even the slight accent
524 of patronization was there. Perfect, right down to the last detail.
525   Omega wanted to lam the phone down, but something, perhaps a need for identity stopped him.
526 
527   "Ah, this may sound kind of inquisitive, but who are you?" Fear showed in the other's voice too. Perhaps the Other knew it
528 too.
529 
530   Nevermind!" Screamed Omega, he then continued, "Sarah McCaffery! Who was she?" Someone from his erased past, the best test.
531   "My, ah, a girlfreind. Who was Marcus Llwelynn?" The Other screamed too, although it caused less attention in his apartment
532 than it did at the transit mall.
533 
534   "We both know who each other is, don't we?" Asked the other.
535   "I know who I am, but I do *NOT* know who you are! Tell me!"
536   "I am an agent of Net, and so are you. It is obvious, we are the same person, but why..."
537   A long pause followed, in which they both decided that they might be insane.
538 
539   Omega quickly asked if he was insane, and waited in dread for the answer. The Other claimed that only he had the right to
540 say he was insane, that sort of mind wracking activity continued for quite a while untill they both asked in unison "What do I
541 call you?" both answered in unison "Omega, call yourself Alpha!"
542 
543   Neither was willing to concede their names, until finally "There can only be one of us, you know that don't you?"
544 
545   "I know it, and I also know what I used to be like well enough to know you will decide to kill me soon." Said Omega.
546   "What you used to be like? Christ, you are admitting it? You even admit you are not the real Omega?" Said the Other.
547 
548   "In this conversation, I note that you behave exactly as I did three months ago. Before I found and then lost Sarah."
549   "Sarah didn'tdie, she is here right now, do you want to talk to her?" Asked the Other.
550   Omega wondered if he should, just to hear her voice again. Simply to listen for a while. Eventually he decided not.
551   It was going to be hard enough on her as it was, without her finding out this way. She should not be told, not by him and
552 not by the Other certainly.
553 
554   If she was told now, she would bond with the Otgr and Sarah reincarnated could never love him. Damn! Omega had to find a way
555 to her, Sarah was his fiancee and not the other's!
556 
557   Sarah, alive! The possibilities for their lives boggled the immagination. Oh, sarah...
558 
559   "Listen here, I will call you in a little while. I am going to ask for a leave of abscence with the Net, any objections?"
560   "I am no longer an active Net agent, and they aren't expecting any calls from me, so go right ahead." Said the Other.
561 
562   Omega dropped the receiver to the ground, not bothering to place it in its proper place, where it should have been.
