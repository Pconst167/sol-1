20 I wonder what ever happened to PAM? It has been quite some time
21 since she has imbibed at the Inn. Did she get tired of it, or
22 angry? What caused her to loose interest? I truly miss her input,
23 it was as the tangy sharp sweetness of an orange. Something to
24 waken the spirit and mind to start the day refreshed and alive.
25 I know you won't read this PAM, but won't you come back?

65 Hi All,
66      Tuck here.  Did you ever wonder about rocks?  How much have they
67 contributed to the human race (Not to sound pro-human, but I need an angle.)
68 Do you see any future in rocks?  All this, and much more, in the next few
69 paragraphs.
70      Did you ever stop to look at a rock?  Sure you have.  Rocks just come
71 in so many different shapes and size that one of them has to turn you on.
72 I was going through Easter Oregon one day, and I saw this lovely rock,
73 It was about 4'x7'x5' and covered with patches of moss.  It would
74 have been great for my room, but I didn't know how to get it in the car
75 without scraping the moss off.  So, I....Oh, yah, back to rocks.
76      Where would we be without rocks?  Those prehistoric men had to have
77 something to make spear heads out of.  Don't tell me that they could have
78 used metal, it ain't so.  If you are going heat metal, or shape it, you
79 need stone.  For the furnace and the hammers.  Wood furnaces don't
80 cut it, and the only thing hard enough to shape metal besides stone, is
81 dried cow dung, and I think they were smart enough to stay away from
82 it.  Face it, without rocks, we would still be in the Stone Age, correction
83 make that Pre-Non-Existant-Rock Age.
84      What's to come for rocks?  Takeing a pesimistic veiwpoint,
85 I guess we could throw they at the Commies after WW III.  Rocks really
86 have a future in artwork and computers.  Pretty soon, with everybody
87 having a computer and what-not, the artist are going to team with
88 IBM and we are going to have some fancy custom designed computers.
89 Rocks are going to play and important part in this new disipline of art.
90 Full consoles make of rock, it would be very impressive.  If they can
91 design stone speakers, then you could have real rock rocks.
92      Think about the rock.  And remember, when you are about to sit on
93 a rock, that could be the army's latest in land mines.

97 PC&S, wonderfull place, but I made it there too late. How soon will I see
98 you all again? anybody new show up? I had some chocolate for leonard, money
99 for Voyeur and a head full of ideas on reviving BW. Or a head full of toxins
100 that lead me to think I had ideas on reviving BW, I don't know which.
101 Laz:I think I need to disagree on your thoughts about the draft and fighting
102 for my way of life. If some country invaded america, they would be faced wi|
103 with more opposition then one would think. We have folks who have rifles and
104 handguns legaly, still more not legaly and a society that has access to 
105 information on how to build all kinds of bombs and weaponry. I would not 
106 join the military, I would kill  and destroy with the best of them on my
107 own. I do not see how going to war in another country would help my,or any 
108 body elses lifestyle. Sure, if some arab country wanted to be flaming idiots
109 and cut off our oil`supply, or if some other country did it for us, things 
110 would be drastic for a while. We have cars that get 40+ MPG on gas, they 
111 will also run quite well on alchohol. It was amazing to`see how fast
112 alternate energy sources were developed during the first arab oil embargo.
113 Then it just sort of slacked`off when oil became easyer to get.
114 oops, got to go, duty calls.

116 CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
117 I agree with laz but for different reasons.  The reason that public resis-
118 tance to the Vietnam "conflict" was so pervasive was that a cross-section
119 of the population had direct contact with the military at that time.
120 A person faced with the possibility of losing life in a war scrutinizes
121 that war and analyzes U.S. policy in a far more active way than someone
122 who merely observes.  One of the disturbing things about the all volunteer
123 army is that volunteers are either career military or those who want to
124 take advantage of vocational training.  These people do not criticize.
125 They do not report military abuses of discipline or funds. They make it 
126 possible for the armed services to operate in a sphere independent of 
127 everyday citizens and away from public scrutiny.  It is naive to think 
128 that we can do away with a standing army until attack is immanent.  As
129 long as we have an army, it should be served by every citizen, male and
130 female, educated and uneducated.  This ensures a far more informed and
131 involved citizenry and a more responsible and honest military.

142 MiG: PorSFiS/PC&S consisted of those at Risk-Alex+Dreamtoucher.  We left
143 there around 5:00, at which time Leonard went off to do 'something',
144 Petrov went home, and L'homme & I went to the Tower East.  There we 
145 transferred approximately 60% of the archives (say 5.5 Mbytes) from
146 IBM to TRS-80 M1 at 9600 baud with NO errors.  Sunday should see the rest
147 of the transfer made, at which time it goes to M3 TRSDOS, and I get to 
148 xfer from single sided to double sided (I really don't want 50 disks tied
149 up in the archives when I can do it with 20).  I think if we had realized
150 the amount of work involved in getting the archives from 8" CP/M
151 to Model 3 TRSDOS, (with all necessary intermediate steps), it would have
152 never been undertaken.  And when we have our copies of the archives,
153 we can go back and read the GOOD OLD DAYS, and then we can all say in chorus:
154 ..GOSH HOW CRUMMY BACKWATER HAS BECOME..

164 Hi All,
165      Are we all thinking people here?  Can we be creative?  How about
166 looking at things with a new point of view, sometimes humorous, sometimes
167 not.  Is free form work more creative?  Can BackWater survive this non-
168 creative phase?
169      Should we call this the Warboard?  Summer has ended, and only the
170 really dedicated will remain.  Let humor remain, for Lord knows that I
171 need all I can get.  Still keep it philisophical, so you can learn
172 something.
173      Keep the stories going.  They, at least, take some planning and
174 ploblem solving skills.  I think what this country needs is a good
175 dose of comman sense.  Think for yourself, do what you want.  Don't
176 rely on others for ideas.  Make them and test them yourself.  It's work,,
177 but it's worth it.

192 Hello, 
193      Think of the trees that are all around us.  Aren't they important
194   too?  Nobody ever notices trees, they are just too busy.  Think of the
195   trees, how many times have you looked at a trees and said "WOW! what a 
196   nice tree." ?  How many times have you used a tree?  A lot I can say.
197   Where would we be if the trees never grew as it does today.  The old
198   pioneers wouldn't have had anything to build their houses from, their
199   boats, tools.  The prehistoric men wouldn't have had anything to tie
200   their rocks to.  Except for bones that is.  Just think of the trees, 
201   how many times have you sat under a tree for shade, to get out of the
202   rain.  How many times a day do you use something that comes from a 
203   tree?  Here is a little exparement.  Look around you in that room where
204   your computer is.  Now look again and try to imagin if all of the wood
205   products (pencils, paper, computer stand, chair) were gone.  What could
206   ever replace the wood?
207      And think of the government, with their little tricky ways of hidding
208   nuclear arms.  Toxic waste and missle silo's.  You can never be safe under
209   the watchfull eyes of the feds.
210      Next time take a GOOD look at a tree.  And before you sit under it,
211   please make sure that it is not a MX misslie with leaves.  A hollow tree
212   full of chemical waste, (you can tell this by how much it glows every
213   night and if the people that were sitting under it are now green).
214      Remember the good things about our most beloved tree.  Some are older
215   than your oldest grandparents, and they will probably out grow you too
216   so take a good look now while you have a chance.  Before your gone too.

244 A mishmash today.
245 J.C. - Welcome, I remember some of your thoughtful input in days past, when I was another
246        person on the board.  Does your return have a connection to the commencing of
247        educational activities ?
248 
249 Bard - 'Run' was most inspiring.  Is there an original allegorical meaning, or may we draw our own ?
250        Was the song based on historical fact ?  It was very beautiful.  Thank you.
251 
252 R.R. - As has been stated earlier, avoiding a standing army until you are invaded is folly.  And
253        movies like Red's are preposterous.  If a large portion of populace and decision makers had
254        held sway with your ideas for any longer than they did prior to WWII, we would probably
255        be a part of the Third Reich by now.
256        As for Social Security being around when you are ready to retire, you must be joking.  It
257        was Smiley himself who said, a little over 4 years ago, that "if you are under the age of 40,
258        Social Security will not be available to you when you retire."  He did not absolve us of the duty
259        (right ?) to pay for it.
260        You also neglected to answer my question about your grandfather.  If his life concerned you, which 
261        I commend you for, why did you not sell your belongings, work more hours, or find some way to
262        provide for your own kin?  Do I expect you to take care of my family ?  No.  (Some things, such 
263        as roads, defense, etc. are unavoidable, but almost everything has a price.)  I am certain that
264        your grandfather would have appreciated your help more than anything from the government.
265 
266 Alex - Have you ever played non-sequential risk ?  I have the rules, and would love to tell you about it 
267        sometime.  What did M.T. say ?
268 
269 Mikey - Having been around for over a year, I have seen one full undulation of the pendulum.  What is
270         the normal ratio of Fantasy to debate ?  (Perhaps the archivers could tell.)
271

273 P.S. Archivers, I am saving up to have 40 8" disks.  (I have the requisite $)  How may we go about the

283 The Marvelous Axe (words: David Erickson,tune:"The Marvelous Toy" by Tom Paxton
284 When I was just a wee Viking lad, full of health and joy,
285 My father homeward came from a raid and he gave to me a toy.
286 A wonder to behold it was, made of steel so bright;
287 The moment I laid hands on it, it became my heart's delight.
288 Chorus:It went swish when it moved, and splat when it stopped;
289 It never did stand still. A Viking axe is what it was,
290 And it was made to kill.
291 The first time that I picked it up, I had a big surprise,
292 'Cause I swung it, then it swung me, I couldn't believe my eyes.
293 It first swung once, then swung twice, then whirled over my head,
294 And when I went on my first raid, this is what it did:
295 CHORUS
296 It first slashed left, then slashed right, then flew out of my hand.
297 And when I looked where it had gone, not an enemy did stand.
298 I found that it had slashed right through a hundred Mongols' heads;
299 And when I picked it up again, the Ka-Khan, too, was dead.
300 CHORUS
301 The raids have gone by too quickly, it seems. I have my own little brat;
302 And yesterday I gave to him my marvelous Viking axe.
303 His eyes nearly popped right out of his head, and he gave a sneer of glee.
304 Neither one of us knows just what it is, but he loves it just like me.

364 Aaron : humor is not your strong point. But if the Commode isn't your strong
365    point either, good for you! My problem has been hacked...er I mean solved,

372 OK, Rocks and trees and dirt are just fine.  BUT YOU FORGOT WATER!  How will
373 those poor rocks turn into dirt if they don't have water?  
374 Let's ask ourselves this, what would we be doing if we didn't have water?  We
375 would have to find something else to drink huh?  Just think of all of the many
376 things that you use each day that were made by using water.  How many times
377 have you visited the local bathroom today????  So many things are made with
378 water it would be hard to survive without it.  How would the trees grow and the
379 rocks turn to mud and dirt?  Oh *SOB* right.  
380 Just take the television series "V".  We wouldn't have to deal with those
381 pesky criders if we didn't have any water for them to steal.  And we would
382 probably be dead so who would care anyway?  At least NBC would loose a lot
383 of viewers.  
384 How would we ceep all of the poor little fishies alive without water?  They
385 would all be dead along with just about every other creature.
386 So water is important to us you say.  I'll agree with you on that one.

392 OKAY GUYS ROCKS,TREES,DIRT AND WATER ARE ALL VERY GOOD BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO
393 GOOD OL' RELIABLE AIR.  
394 WHAT WOULD MAKE THE WIND TO BLOW THE DIRT TO MAKE MUD TO HARDEN AND BECOME 
395 STONE. WHAT WOULD CARRY THE WATER MOLECULES TO THE SKY TO MAKE CLOUDS AND 
396 RAIN TO CAUSE EROSION TO BREAK AWAY THE LOOSE DIRT TO LET THAT POOR STONE GO 
397 FREE.(WHEW WHAT A HAND FULL) YOU GUYS FORGOT ABOUT SUPER MAN. WHERE WOULD HE
398 GO WHEN HE SAYS UP UP AND AWAY. WHO WOULD HE SAVE? A BUNCH OF EMTY SPACE?
399 WE ALL FORGOT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF AIR. TO KEEP US ALIVE. 
400 GOD WOULD BE QUITE LONELY. THERE WOULD BE NO ONE AROUND TO TALK TO.
401 REMBER EVEN IF WE COULD LIVE YOU CANT TALK IN A VACUME. SOUND DEPENDS
402 GREATLY ON AIR. EVER TRY TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHILE HOLDING YOUR BREATHE?
403 NO I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT TAKING A DEEP BREATHE AND CLOSING YOUR MOUTH. I'M
404 TALKING ABOUT EXHALING THEN CLOSING YOUR MOUTH. IT DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL.
405 BACK TO SOUND. SOUND WAVE TRAVEL ON AIR. YOU COULDN'T TALK TO YOUR GIRL.
406 YOU COULDN'T TALK TO YOUR COACH ABOUT THAT PLAY YOU JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET
407 RIGHT.
408 LOOK AT ALL THAT WASTED ORGAN MATERIAL IN YOUR BODY THAT MAKE UP YOUR LUNGS.
409 TREES COULDN'T GROW BECAUSE AGAIN THE WATER MOLECULES COULDN'T MAKE CLOUDS
410 TO MAKE RAIN TO SOAK THE GROUND TO GET TO THE ROOTS TO WATER THE TREE.

436 ONE LINE LEFT
437 MY COSMIC ADVENTURES ON FERN UNIT CONT.......
438 and thank you so much for the kind critique....
439 
440 My heart was beating fast when I awakened.  I had forgotton that it would be a 
441 FERN UNIT CONT.
442 I had started to knit a pair of swimming trunks last week for the day and now
443 I would have to finish them in a hurry for the day only lasted a day.  I know
444 the river would be warm and gentle and a twitch of excitement ran through my
445 brain.  I reached for my knitting needles that were on my dresser next to my
446 small unit collection and began to knit away on my swimming trunks.
447 
448 It wasn't lomg before I had finished.  My swimming trunks were breathtaking.
449 Even the holes were in the right places.  I put them on feeling a little 
450 lightheaded and gathered my towel and lotion I made from Fern Oil and stepped
451 Hello to you all,
452 I wish to thank Bob Wood for giving me this opportunity to read this BBS.  I thoroughly enjoyed it (if enjoy is the correct
453 word) and it is pleasing to see that there are so many users with intelligence enough not to abuse the system with vulgarity, 
454 rudeness or socially unacceptable slangs and wordings as to offend anyone reading the BBS.  I think that people like myself 
455 who use much too much of the boards space should inhibit themselves to just a few lines or phrases so that we all(meaning all 
456 of you users) can give our two cents worth or our critiques of those ahead of us on the board.  May I also say that there are 
457 a few of you out there with a tremendous ability toward writing and imagination.  I only wish that I, an old dog, could be 
458 or have the potential that those few have shown.  But unfortunately, "new tricks" for my breed are far and few learned.
459 I do not want to seem crass, but a few of you out there have no idea of what reality is, no offense given and I hope none 
460 taken, but to talk of war, of service to ones country, of invading hoards of mongol savages or the argumentation of right or
461 wrongs of the draft, war as a whole or the reasons to justify your participation, have obviously never had to face an actual 
462 occurence of death, savagery, primeval killing as I have had to experience during the flowering of my youth.  Yes, this old 
463 dog can talk from experience, and not just learned arguments through schools of education or of thought processes that can 
464 identify with what they experience through rated television, video or movie atropine injections.  War is neither medieval nor 
465 is it romantic and brave.  War is primevil, sal, so primeval that it takes from the deepest, darkest sides of humanity and 
466 shows itself to be the monster that each of us denys even recognizing let alone possessing ourselves.  I will not linger where
467  memories cast dark, dreadful nightmares in the caverns of my subconscious.  War is something that can not be argued, defended
468  nor condemned without the measure of experience that the person must have before he or she can take a stand one way or the
469  other.  War is something that must be fought by men and women, children and sinless animals are its victims.  Let us hope 
470 that if we don't ponder on if we should fight or not to fight, instead let us just say that the wars have been fought already 
471 in the past and I can not fathom fighting another in the future for there is no future with war.
472         With those humble inner feelings I again thank those who have assisted this night into being one that I can rank as 
473 worthwhile and enjoyable.

489 Leonard, what a control space does depends on your terminal, on some it
490 produces a null, or zero byte, but on many it does nothing. A control 
491 shift 0 may produce a null instead. If you lack the paperwrk to tell
492 what yours does, the only alternative is to try it, and lokk at it with
493 either software, aor output it to something like a scope. And I hope
494 you aren't using something like a Teletype mode 40, it's control keys
495 are really scrambled.

553 I can't agree with the above statements concerning AIR!  It is dirty, contains
554 dangerous substances such as Nitrogen, a known narcotic, and oxygen, an
555 instantly addictive drug, which is impossable to kick.  So don't brag about
556 air, your probably a user, too!

561 Air?  Water?  Dirt?  Rocks?  Trees?
562 
563 What about the greatest natural
564 resource of all:
565 
566             GIRLS!!
567 
568 Huh?  Without them, there would be no
569 humans (or anything else) to complain
570 about how much we should appreciate all
571 those things you've been complaining 
572 about.  Try going to a drive-in with a
573 tree.  Or a lunch date with a glass of
574 water.  It would get jealous when the
575 waiter brought you another one!
576 Air?  Air!!  Ha! There is so much
577 pollution you can't find any! Why don't
578 we add a 'w' to it - call it wair!
579 As in 'wair' is the air?
580 Dirt! okay, okay, dirt is neat to play
581 with, but that's about it.  Go out in
582 your back yard an put a string bikini
583 on your vegetable garden.  Kinda lumpy,
584 ain't it?!  So, some girls are that way
585 to, but look down!  What's that strange
586 round ball of flesh with a navel? Your
587 stomach, that's what!
588 Rocks!  Give me a break!  The only
589 thing those are good for is names:
590 Rock Hudson, Rock-a-bye-baby, Rock-
591 n-Roll, etc...  The Rolling Stones
592 could have easily called themselves the
593 Falling Mentalities and no one would
594 ever have noticed!  So while all
595 you guys are trying to get legal licen-
596 ses to marry a tree, I'll be snug in
597 front of a fire with a G-I-R-L!!!
598 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
599 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
600 Personally, my tastes have always tended more towards women rather than
601 girls, mostly because you need to be able to do something once the love-
602 making is over (like talk!).  Give me a mature woman any day over a young,
603 nubile girl (though I'm not knocking young nubile girls, I'm always open to
604 youth!)
