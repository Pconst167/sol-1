45     Hello all, I've returned from a long period of absence.  Have I missed any
46 really big stuff? (besides the names debate, I caught most of that on DB.
47     I've been in and out of town for a while now, and thus is the reson for
48 my lack of interjecting my drivel here and there.  Worldcon was nice, but
49 Westercon had a far superior film and video showing.  Anyone else down

56 Gee, I missed all those line feeds - my system filters them out since
57 they act as a LF/CR combo (as does a CR).  One of the idiosyncrasies of the
58 Radio Shack line.  (It also necessitates getting rid of all the 0As in
59 the Archives - truly a monumental task).
60 Prometheus - You are definitely having some problems finding a nice,
61 unobtrusive control character that offends no one.  I have my terminal program
62 set up to print out the control character OR 40H (i.e. control O prints as O ).
63 Ergo, your last message had strings of Os in it.  My problem, not yours, of course.
64 If you can tweak your program properly, I think it would definitely be a
65 good idea to use nulls.
66 And, I went back to Thursday's Oregonian, and found your picture.
67 All I could see of your face was from your nose down, but then, that's all I ever
68 Have seen of you.    Congratulations, you're a star...

78 MY MIND WANTED DESPERATELY TO FIND THIS UNCERTAIN STRANGER, SO I DECIDED
79 TO GO ON AN EXPEDITION WHEN I AWOKE.  I WOULD SEEK OUT THE CHILDREN OF
80 TRUTH IN THE CAVE OF ANSWERES WHICH WAS LOCATED IN A DESTINATION KNOWN AS
81 THE BLUELANDS.  THE HIKE WOULD TAKE ALL NIGHT SO I BROUGHT A LUNCH AND ALSO
82 REMEMBERED TO PUT PROTECTION PADS ON MY FEET.  IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE 
83 I HAD TRAVELED AND IT FELT GOOD INSIDE MY BODY.  I WALKED EAST OVER THE SAND
84 THAT WAS SURROUNDED BY FERN SHRUBS ABD INTO THE WET MARSHES BROUGHT ON BY THE
85 DRY RAINS OF THE BLUELANDS.  
86 
87 MY HEART SANG OUT TO ME WHICH MADE ME JUMP SINCE I HADN'T HEARD MUSIC IN SUCH
88 A LONG TIME. IT WAS A HAPPY TUNE ABOUT TRAVELING WITH A SPECIAL FRIEND AND I
89 KNEW THE SONG WELL.  I KEW I WAS GETTING NEAR THE BLUELANDS FOR THE CANYONS
90 WERE BEGINNING TO FADE A CHALKY BLUE.  I FOUND A COMFORTABLE ROCK TO HAVE MY
91 LUNCH WITH AND I NOTICED THAT MY FOOD HAD ALREADY MUTATED.  IT WOULD NOT BE
92 LONG BEFORE MY HANDS AND FACE WOULD DO SO AS WELL.  I ACCEPTED THIS WITHOUT
93 THINKING MUCH ABOUT IT SINCE IT WAS A NATURAL FACTOR IN THE BLUELANDS.  WHEN
94 I APPROACHED THE CAVE OF ANSWERES THE TREES BEGAN TO RING OUT NOTES OF BLUE
95 THAT ECHOED THROUGH THE CANYONS.  I KNEW THE CHILDREN WOULD BE ANXIOUS. THE
96 LAST TIME I HAD TRAVELED TO THE CAVE SOME OF THE CHILDREN LOST THEIR TONGUES
97 OF HONESTY FROM TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT.  I HOPED THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE RELAXED

180 Voyeur attention was easily gained, and Milchar asked about the current status of the Inn.  Voyeur, a little wisful for
181 something he called "The Good Old Days", was quite depressed at the moment.
182 "Ahh, then, my friend, I shall relate all I know about the mystical Ruby Valley, and you may decide for yourself if it
183 would be worth the trip.
184 The ancient sages, in their quest for knowledge, discovered that all that exists in this multiverse has a center.  A
185 good example of this, of course, is the naturally perfect circle.  They reasoned further that if everything has a
186 center, then naturally the Multiverse itself must have one.  The difficult part was to prove it, for no one knew which
187 way to go to get there.
188 And so this theory was just that until only a few milennia ago, when a certain illustrious Mage of no small ability
189 (Only known to others as Dimat) discovered the way, a long, drawn-out spellcasting affair which caused many trying to 
190 perform the rite to collapse from exhaustion.  But so great was Dimat's power that he created a lesser gate, but one
191 which would only open at certain times of great importance.  Exactly what all of these times are no one knows, but a 
192 which would only open at certain times of great importance.  Exactly what all of these times are no one knows, but a 
193 few of these times are known to his students.  I am Dimat's last student.  He still lives, but deals with matters I
194 cannot even begin to imagine.
195 But enough of the background.  This gate that Dimat created is called Nor-gate, and it opens directly into the Ruby
196 Valley's northern reaches.  Ahh... the Valley.
197 The Valley itself is a wonder to behold, plants and earth forming patterns and shapes to please the eye and the soul.
198 But the foremost reason most travel there is to behold what comes every revolution of The Clock- the Valley map.  This,
199 in itself, is something that would take a novel to explain, and not clearly even then.
200 Small Ruby-Creatures swarm from myriads of tiny holes in the plants and the earth, and line themselves into patterns and
201 rows and shapes, just finishing as the last ray of light fades at sunset... and then, and only then, can one see a 
202 map of the entire Multiverse at one glance, detailed by the rays of the dying sun reflecting from the Ruby-Creatures.
203 The sight...the sight..."
204 Milchar begins to weep, and only with a few moments of determined effort is he able to contain himself.

264 The had this wonderfully load brass band there, I enjoyed myself. Then I went home, and they bitched, and yelled, and were 
265 nearly violent with me. And the best part about it was being able to deal with it all by not being fully aware of my senses.
266 Then this morning I found a pira|e in one of my pirated VAX accounts. Pissed me off to no end when he locked the account

394 Laseter watched from his hotel window as the transport craft settled on it's
395 landing gear. That damnable Fin had found him any way. He could only figure
396 that Fin had some how managed to trace the key. Grumbling to himself that
397 he might of known, the key was tossed down the laundry chute and he hastily
398 grabbed his few possesions and headed for the door. With luck he could be
399 gone before a goon squad showed up and dragged him back to the confines of
400 the transport. So much for peace and quiet.

416 CDP, just a thought about this "NAME" issue: I noticed that you haven't
417 put up YOUR name, just initials. At least I use one of my names when I
418 do sign off (which is most of the time) and though I've been rather a
419 reluctant fellow at attempting to make it to PorSiFis (is that right?)
420 meetings and such I don't mind identifying myself with an AKA. If your
421 really interested in studying an "emerging culture" I suggest you move to
422 Antelope. WHOOOPSS! That should have been Rajneesh. Now I' have to wash
423 the terminal and modem becuz I used a nasty name! Well, gotta go!

442 Well, maybe if you tried the straight forward aproach.
443 How about it Pam? Are you still out there? You've got
444 a lot of worried people out here wondering what happened.

450    If you really took the time to read ALL the messages on this board you
451 would have seem that I have left my name twice. If you are not quick enough
452 to catch it then your loss.

454 All-
455    I would like to try and clarify this one more time ( and I promise it will
456 be the last, so help me ). The subject of names was not the point. My question
457 was 'how will the ethics of an emerging sub-culture complement or contrast
458 the culture we deal with everyday'. I guess that proposing a question about
459 our human condition dates me ( the 60's and all that ), but I also am a true
460 believer that, to paraphrase, those that ignore history are definitly doomed
461 to repeat it.

475 Huh.  I'm off for 60 hours, and when I come back, it's still the same disk.
476 Amazing.  I see that without my presence, the quality deteriorates, too.
477 L'homme: as you can see, I've got it working (sort of).  I don't really know
478 what the problem was, I just kept poking around until it decided to work
479 (by stages).  Right now, I'm missing my graphics.  My cursor is a graphics
480 block...I HATE NOT HAVING A CURSOR!!!
481 I can't find any reason for the graphics to be out, either. (the proper
482 character is stored in video RAM, but it's never printed).  I've checked all
483 the traces, but they all check out.  I have no way of checking the chips,
484 (that I know of), so.....
485 The computer is currently sitting on my desk, or rather, strewn around on my
486 desk.  The case is in the basement, the circuit board is sitting here getting
487 dusty.  Sigh... I was going to leave you this msg (& more)
488 on PCS, but they aren't accepting new msgs.  So I was going to leave it on
489 Bit Bucket, but it was down for improvements (I found myself in CHAT with
490 Bensene!!!)  He's trying out a 1200 baud modem.
491 #  Nice of you to say Hi this evening.  #
492 I don't want to waste any more of this already pathetic disk on this personal
493 stuff, so I'll talk later.  (I'm curious about my 'report card' for this  morning).

496    Mikey -- I don't have any constructive suggestions as to how to reach PAM.
497 I have seen her a few times on the bit bucket, but not even that lately.  
498 Speaking from my own experience, I have had spells that communicating via
499 modem is just too much trouble ... I used to visit Backwater before it became
500 the Inn (whatever happened to the DBB Sysop? Did they take the padding off
501 his cell?) and also remember the first call by the Dragon Lady, although faintly
502 I stopped using the modem at that point, as work pressure was getting too great
503 and did not start again for a couple of years steady use.  I guess my point is,
504 that Pam will have to decide of her own free will that she wishes to associate
505 with us.  We can but extend the invitation, let her know that she is welcome
506 and missed, and let time take its course.  I hope that her absence is not as
507 protracted as mine was, but although we feel impatient, she must work out 
508 the twists and turnings of her life in her own way.  I only hope that the river
509 of time brings her once more to our shores.  In the same vein, I miss d, our
510 Dragon Lady who started the whole Inn concept.  It was her clear vision that
511 brought a disparate group of souls into a type of reality that has been nearly
512 everyone's home away from mundane reality.  There is a table near the back
513 that has good light, a smooth surface, and has been recently cleaned.  A stock
514 of sharpened pencils, sticks of willow charcoal, and various papers are at hand.

535 Piper: Sigh.. Yes, you are of course right. Though I do miss her input.
536 As I have said before, I get the machoistic approach to life all day
537 long, and the Inn offered an escape from it. You haven't lived until
538 you get a call from some jerk who says he's going to sue you for selling
539 him a program that he couldn't learn because the manual wasn't good
540 enough. (He learned Wordstar so therefor he is an expert computer wiz.)
541 Then he proceeds to say he is going to sic the FTC and every other
542 official sounding agency after me. This was after I spent several hours
543 on the phone helping him get it going. And he didn't even buy the 
544 program from me! It's enough to make you sour on the whole human race!
