20 If I make make a comment (something I normally don't do -- especially something
21 as volatile as politics is -- but I will let loose to opinions. 1) To 
22 Mr. Interceptor, while I don't necessarily agree with many of your
23 postulations, I do agree completely with your last message. As many 
24 on the system who were around a couple of years ago remember, I did
25 not vote for Reagan or Carter, not liking either alternative. Nor
26 have I liked Reagan since, and this latest action only goes to prove
27 in my own mind that I was right.
28 2) In regard to the Cubain missile thing, you stated that there were only
29 two possibilities, one that there weren't any missles, and two that there
30 were but that the government wasn't acknowledging their existance. 
31 There is a third possibility that you seem to refuse to accept. and that
32 is that there are indeed missiles there and the goverenment does not 
33 know about it. That is a possiblity. I agree it has a low probability,
34 but there is still the probability, and it must be considered in any
35 scenario. Of course the obvious advantage of such a location is two
36 fold, one is that it would be almost impossible to stop any missiles
37 launched from Cuba into the southern states since there would be no
38 real time to react to the launch. And of course on a larger scale,
39 land based launches would be far more accuarate. All of this is why
40 Russia tried to set up a missile base there back then. Whether they 
41 have succeded in later years, who is to say. Doubtful, but a possibility.
42 They do however have a refueling base there.
43 Having said that, I'll go back into hiding as is my whaughnt.
44 ******************************** CISTOP MIKEY ****************************
45 Ted, er Mr. Interceptor, can I ask you a question? Are you a skater dude too?
46 
47 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
48 THORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHOR
49 THOR wishes to acknowledge that CISTOP MIKEY is most probably correct.
50 As THOR has been around this blue green earth for a few score years he has
51 seen much in the way of weapons and their modernization.
52 During the days of Nikita and Kennedy, the missiles that were cut off and sent
53 back to mother Russia were of the 5 and 10 megaton capacity. They were very
54 cumberson and needed stationary bases to be launched towards their targets.
55 They were not very effective in that they were especially slow in rising from
56 those bases and would have been easily recognized by our now sophisticated
57 monitoring devices. The probability of their reaching their targets in the
58 good old U.S. of A. were one in three.
59 Still not very good odds especially if you happened to be that particular ONE
60 that was not intercepted. But since
61 the time of the infamous BLOCKADE we
62 have signed a treaty with the USSR in
63 which we agreed to do away with ALL antimissiles. Hard to believe, huh? But
64 sadly true. We HAVE NO ANTIMISSILES anywhere, anymore to try and stop an
65 incoming attack. To make matters worse, with the advent of the CRUISE type
66 missile which is only 1/5th the size of the original 60's missiles, it is
67 virtually impossible to detect their incoming as they have the ability to 
68 fly at heights of only 60 to 100 feet from the surface of this planet on their
69 way to a 10 to 20 megaton bone tanning
70 party. The Russians have their own
71 variety of this kind of missile and it is of the mobile type which means it
72 does not need a fixed land base to launch from.
73 The missile can be shipped in the guise of crated farming supplies to Cuba
74 and assembled in any large garage or warehouse. It can be mounted on a 2 1/2
75 ton truck and transported to any launch
76 site when needed. It is an almost certainy that those missiles are present in
77 Cuba with our own Cruise missiles stationed in Europe on Mother Russias door
78 step. With Cuba being the USSR's closest
79 ally to the USA they would have been moronic not to put those kind of missiles
80 their in order to
81 void the threat of ours in Europe. Not only is our intelligence departments 
82 failures in their abilities(as shown
83 recently with the Reagan fiasco where
84 no two departments knew what the others were doing)but they are inept in their
85 methods of carrying out even the most
86 minor clandestine activity. Remember,
87 they couldn't even find where the 
88 terrosist are keeping the hostages in the middle east. So not to sound too
89 pessimistic, I do not believe that the
90 Russians do not have missiles in CUBA
91 but I do not believe that they would
92 attempt to use them on a first strike
93 basis. I feel they are their ACE in the hole in case we imperialistic capitalists
94 decide to attack them first from our European bases. They would not and could
95 not advertise or use them as bargaining
96 pieces as they can admit of their existence without fear of more reprisals 
97 against Fidels Fools. THOR apoligizes
98 for talking of such morbid matters for
99 so long of a time.

146 ---
147 After reading all of the last disk and this disk up to this point, I have come
148 to my own opinion.  I am extremely tired of political discussions and prolific
149 screen-graphic drawings by 10-calls-a-day skater dudes.  If I want to engage
150 in some fascinating political discussion, I need only go to school.  If I wish
151 to hear from hard-a** skater dudes, I'll go down to the local gang hangout.
152 Don't get me wrong.  I am absolutely, unequivocally (1 l or 2?) saying that
153 such comments are acceptable occasionally (2 l's, definitely), but I have
154 personally grown tired of them in the last 10 minutes.  Maybe some of you
155 skater dudes know what I'm talking about... it's like listening to a
156 Led Zeppelin tune for the 256th time!  Or making love for 20 hours straight.
157 (Note: This was to catch the attention of twits and self-proclaimed studs.)
158 I'm not going whine.  I know that doesn't work.  I'm just asking for a little
159 variety.  This does not mean to fill up Backwater with stories and otherworldly
160 names.  Even that gets old after awhile.  I know all this is useless, but
161 maybe, just maybe someone will disagree with me and respond, thereby forcing
162 the change I so desperately want.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to come back
163 to see what's happened until mid-January.  (L'homme, Voyeur, or French Toast
164 please insert French equivalent of such is life here).  I realize that you are
165 more than likely getting bored with my ravings.  GOOD!!
166 Now you know how I feel.
167 ---More aliases than you can imagine or remember.

169 Yea, me too, that's what I was going to say.  I don't particularly care what the
170 Soviets have got up their .....  Big deal if the Soviets have got missiles on
171 Cuba, does it really matter?  So we'll all get blown to bits, BIGL!!!!!!!!!!

183 I have just been lurking, of late.  I think the discussion has been
184 very good, although I am somewhat surpised at the switch from Middle
185 East weaponry to Cuban.  Does anyone out there believe that perhaps the
186 time has come to change the presidency ?  (The office, not just the
187 current occupant.)
188 My proposal would be to limit the CEO to 1 term of six years.  It seems
189 that with the exception of FDR, six years is as long as anyone can remain
190 coherent as president in this century.
191 The second item would be to have both a President and perhaps a Premier.
192 One for domestic policies, which Reagan seems to be somewhat adept at,
193 and one for foreign relations, where Mr. Reagan seems to have his head
194 in a surprising anatomical position.
195 What do you think ?  Would it be too cumbersome ?
196 How about the Canadian version, where a chief of state is elected until he
197 is defeated ?  (If that is correct, something about a vote of 'no 
198 confidence'.)
199 Just some thoughts.

256     A room in an Elizabethan period house.
257     Diamond pane leaded windows. Snow falling
258     outside. Log fire blazing in the stone fireplace.
259     The old gentleman in a dark green tweed suit
260     coughs nervously as he opens the door into a
261     lead lined aquarium room. The first time this
262     door has been opened since he placed an object
263     in the tank in 1948. He was a young man then.
264 
265     The object was a radioactive isotope wrapped in
266     human skin. And it was submerged in an
267     aquarium full of organic fluids with a small
268     electrical current running constantly through it.
269     This arrangement was left undisterbed in the 
270     dark sealed room until now.
271 
272     An incredible stink meets him as he goes into the
273     blackness. He coveres his nose and mouth with a
274     hankerchief while he gropes for the rusted light
275     switch. The room is illuminated under rust
276     speckled fluoresent lights.
277 
278     He sees a delicate pale fungus has developed
279     and spread over the ceiling and walls. The big
280     aquarium is now only partly full of a black
281     highly concentrated liquid. There is a half
282     submerged shape inside.
283 
284     The doctor snaps on a pair of shiny rubber
285     gloves and throws an earth wire into the tank.
286     There is a black crackel of released energy. He
287     reaches down into the tank, brushing off the
288     accumulated sediment from the shape. He rolls
289     the thing over to inspect it and there is a flash of
290     broken gold among the glistening slime. The
291     thing looks like a small ancient Egyptian 
292     mummy, thin and dark with fluid. Its limbe hang
293     from the tank into a shower.
294 
295     The stink of many stagnant years spreads as the
296     warm needle spray cuts through the layers of 
297     organic soup. Pieces of a filmy material,
298     tarnished gold on one side and black on the 
299     other, break off and slide like wet gelatine down
300     the drain, as the old man eagerly washes off all
301     traces of the foul sediment.

316 Ahhhhhh!  The board is finally back to normal.
317    First, no I am not a skater dude, a simple comparison of writing styles
318 should tell that.  I see you had to dig back into the files to find out my REAL
319 name, an action that is almost unheard of on backwater.  I guess I have been 
320 stirring up trouble, then.
321    Also, I think it is very probable that there are missles on Cuba, but I 
322 think that we are keeping quiet about it.   It is possible, yes, that we don't 
323 know about it, but if we don't know about missiles that close to our borders,
324 then we might as well go home and go to bed.   I still feel that sub launched 
325 missiles in WWIII would make Cuban missiles insignificant.
326 I remember reading an analysis of the procedures that the President would have
327 to go through in case of a sudden launch. From his desk in the White House, a
328 special limo  would rush him at top speed to the nearest airport(I believe Dulles)
329 and a warmed up helicopter would rush him to the airport out of town where a 
330 jet would race him off to Wyoming.  Or, a helicopter on the White House lawn 
331 would race him to Dulles..    Anyway, the fastest route out of the White House
332 took twelve minutes before he was out of the city.  This was after many trial
333 runs and experimenting.  A sub launched missile would take an estimated 10 
334 minutes at the longest to reach Washington.  The general conclusion was that
335 if the President was in Washington and WWIII broke out then he was dead.
336 So from a stratigic point, what does it matter if Cuban missiles could 
337 destroy the country. As soon as the nerve center goes, you've won.

363 Political discussions are interesting, because none of us are professional
364 politicians. We can't hide behind a facade of acronyms and sacred knowledge
365 like any discussion of computers, cars, stereo's, foriegn countries, etc.
366 would contain. In one sense of the word, we are all on equal ground. Then
367 again, I read some of the comments: The 'who cares', the 'it does not matter',
368 the typical apathetic head-in-sand attitude that so many users here appear
369 to have. People who offer such opinions are only further proving that they
370 have nothing useful to say. The can't add anything positive to the conversation
371 so they add something very negative. It is always easier to come up with
372 insults that it is to think of something constructive. Many people are taking
373 the easy route. If you don't like the discussion, don't make a pain-in-the-
374 ass of yourself telling everyone else your nihilistic point-of-view. Those
375 of us who are interested in conversing with other intelligent computer users
376 over an electronic media don't give a flying-fig about your lack of ability
377 to take part in the conversation. We don't want to hear it, so knock it off!

389 And finally...Did you know that at 4:00 am on Wednesday December 31st, our
390 time, millions upon millions of people will be gathering in cities, towns and villages around the world (including Portland)
391 and including Russia to pray, meditate, cogitate, think, visualize, etc. on 
392 world peace.  There should be well over 50 million people simultaneously 
393 concentrating on healing the planet of strife at that time.  In Portland
394 there will be a group meeting at the Northwest Service Center
395 18th and NW Everett (I think - check phone book) starting at 3:30 am on
396 December 31st.  It is free to all.  Or take the time out on that morning

401   Well, here I am again, no thanks to the call-waiting, which I how have 
402   disabled. I thought that I might call up and reveal some more of the
403   story. It seems that no one else has any thing of any literary interest
404   to say. Let's try and do a little better at this. Ok? Anyway, about my
405   political views, if we get nuked, which we will not, we will all be dead,
406   or as good as dead, so, who cares about missles, what we should really
407   worry about is a possible invasion or just ( this is more likely ) a
408   continuing cold war and arms race. However, who am I to say this, because,
409   I am but a mere speck...

413     The creature beneath resembles a thin, ten year
414     old boy with wet golden hair, and water
415     wrinkled skin like a feotus. The doctor dries him 
416     off in heavy towels and places him on a sterile
417     trolley after massaging his skin with lanolin to
418     smooth it out.
419     
420     There appears to be something wrong with the
421     left side of the boy's face and shoulder. In the
422     dimness of the room his face resembles an
423     antique paintings from a damaged religious
424     Icon, one side of it is corroded by a faint
425     irradescent bluish glow.
426 
427     The doctor is deeply disturbed by this
428     unexpected imperfection, but nevertheless still
429     excited by the result of his long experiment.
430     
431     With a small catheter tube he expertly clears the
432     boy's nose, mouth and ears of mucous, then
433     slides him into the body of a complex
434     life-supporting and monitioing system.
435 
436     The machine hums and pumps, and after a
437     while the boy begins to breathe. His pale face
438     flushes delicately as his heart suffuses his skin
439     with blood.
440 
441     After some hours, when he is at last certain that
442     the boy can function independantly the doctor
443     lifts him out of the machine and carries him into
444     a warm, darkened bedroom.
445 
446     In the rustling dimness, winter birds sining
447     outside the curtained windows, the doctor is
448     quiet moved to tears by the boy's sleeping
449     religious aspect. The eroded edges of that
450     delicate face and shoulder seem unbearably
451     poignant.
452     "My own flesh and blood, all this time, all this
453     time and still not perfect, so damaged, so
454     damaged."
455     The doctor whispers softly, realising with
456     suprise that this is the first time he has felt any
457     strong emotion for many, many years.

562 Well, I can see that finals week is taking it's toll.  It looks like the
563 political discussions are winding down.  Is anyone yet in the mood for 
564 adventuring? 
565           
566          
567      The son entered the fathers small room, moved over to the edge of the bed
568 and sat down in the chair facing his father's face.  Heavily lined and old, it
569 had many years of life stored away, and deep grey eyes looked out.
570    "You know that I am going to be dead before the morning, Eldrin."
571   "No, father, you will get better, the doctor said!" insisted his son.
572    "The time for lying is over, Eldrin.  I feel Death near, I have been burning
573 up inside for the last week. I know the time is come."  
574    The old man spoke simply, with no emotion. 
575    "It has not been permitted for you to know, yet, but years before you were
576 born I did a favor for the Tecontar. In return, I was given a ring that had a 
577 matching mate to it."
578    Here the man removed the ring from his left hand, and pointed out the ripples in
579 the edge of one side of the ring.
580    "these ridges correspond exactly to the ridges on an otherwise identicle 
581 twin of it. If they are placed together with the ridges interlocking with other
582 the rings will display the symbol of the High house of the Tecontar.  That 
583 house is now no longer in existence, but there may be decendents from it.
584 The mate of this ring was kept as a heirloom in that house.  At the time that
585  I was given it, I was told to pass it on to my son When he came of age. This
586 you have not yet done, but I must give you this ring before I die. There is a
587 prophecy on these rings that will be fufilled when they are once again joined,
588 one that I know but cannot tell you.  You must take this ring, and find the    
589 mate, to fufill my promise to the Tecontar."
590     "Who are the Tecontar?" Eldrin asked.
591     The old man smiled, "zThey live in the far east, go to the city of Roan and
592 ask about them.  There you may still find news of them."
593     "Take about you certain companions of yours who might be interested in
594 this errand. You may search a long time."
595    At this the old man closed his eyes.

620 Mr. Interceptor: Last I heard the copter would take him to Camp David. They havequite a bunker there. There are rumors of 
621 another shelter under the white house. The only time that they'd have to do this is if there was no reason to expect the 
622 attack. Otherwise, in times of crisis the president stays close to shelter. And all he needs to do is send one signal to
623 launch *our* attack. Plus there are contigencies that allow sub commanders to launch without orders. I suspect that if 
624 Washington went, SAC would launch orders or no orders!
