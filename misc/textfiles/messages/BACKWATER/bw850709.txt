21 Csan it be that I am at the top? YES! It's true!
22 Emu:( a chair, yes.): Thank you for your support. I agree. Where i come from
23 there are flying lizards. We use the meat for food, as we surely could NOT
24 eat another intelligent being, a~d all 
25 the animals are as intelligent or more so than I. We use the lizard skin in place of leather. Once again Thank you
26 for your support. I really appreciate it!
27 Dante: Ah yes, your Earthly Bible. But surely you must realize txat i and my frinds
28 are most definitely NOT from this dimension. We are from The Wizard's World (tm.). Our bible goes a little 
29 differently saying that God created the humans and txe animals, that some but not all weould be like himself. But first 
30 God created the insects, and the Lizards. And then God created the Plated Folk,which I think was a mistake. That's just 
31 the way it is. Ok? PLEASE DANTE! Let's not be enemies! Let'S be PEOPLE who go to the Inn to talk. That'S all! It 
32 doesn'T matter thhat I have whiskers thatgrow sideways instead of down, paws instead of palms, and a fur coat instead of 
33 skin, but I'm still a PERSON for it! Right, all?????

47   The sound of our house is always full of the sound of footsteps.  The sound 
48 of running feet used to wake me.  The soft but firm footfalls os youth, end-
49 lessly echoing through our bedroom.  The bright morning sun pushed through the 
50 curtained window along with the winged song of the dawn birds.  Everything
51 seemed so fresh, so young.  And I thought the morning would late forever.
52   Now it is evening.  The small consistant footsteps are gone, faded with the
53 dying sun, now red and full with the trials of the day.  The wind that had in 
54 morning brought fresh breezes now hangs heavy, the curtain still.  The only
55 footsteps are my own, paceing back and forth across the wooden floor of the 
56 bedroom, the sharp sounds springing back like slaps.  Some times I look out at
57 the setting sun and loose myself in the floresent clouds.  Each time my muse
58 has been broken by the silence of the room.  Each time I begin to pace again,
59 the sound lapping at my feet.
60   I look around and see the small things that remind me of you, mentally
61 collecting them into my arms, like the pillow I sleep with at night, held 
62 tight to my chest.  I think about your words, the memory of their sound fills
63 the space between my footsteps, and I smile.  But only for a while.
64   I only hope that I can sleep, wrapped up with my pillow.  And that when I 
65 wake the morning will have returned, and that you will be with me.

98 makes me ill to remember how sick humans are when they turn to war as the last answer.  I know everyone is backed by the
99 constitution to be able to say whatever they like, I am doing it now and this is my opinion: WAR SUCKS!  Even when it is all 
100 'in fun' and a game, it's sick sick sick.
101 Beta Unit: I care. Even though you can be replaced and all that, I care.
102 Max: 22 columns are getting you down?  Writing doubling over itself these days?  All I have to say is that 22 columns sure looks103 silly when you'r using a 132 column screen.  Everyone has a right to use whatever column they want; people should be able

132 not to get angry at poeple for using 128 columns, before I saw nothing wrong

138 To above:
139 Did you ever wonder why the system says "ILLEGAL PARAMETER" when you give
140 the command "ma 128"?  For good reason, as you discovered it does indeed
141 mess up the FI and FA commands.  But the parameter is allowed because there
142 might be some time when it is necessary to have a line of 128 characters.
143 But that's why so many of us don't like that large a line.  If you really
144 need to have a long line, ma 127 will do almost as well (you could say that
145 it will do 127/128ths as well), and still not mess up the FI and FA.  Oh
146 yes, a system is no better than its users, so relax and enjoy.

156 differences in each other and into the true self. You claim to want to have a
157 group of people treat a ferret like the same group would treat a fellow human
158 with differences; I hardly think that would be satisfactory.

201 Zancresta: The 'lizardskin' is still leather. Besides, I've visited places
202 where 'humans' and 'intelligent' animals shared the same territory. In many
203 of them, leather is produced from the skins of deceased people/animals. It
204 is usual to require the permission of the family to obtain the hide. 
205 Leather is VERY useful in a low-tech environment. Try thinking of a 
206 substitute. What would YOUR people do without lizardskin?
207 Dante: As far as I can tell, the 'animals' are refugees from The Alternate
208 World. They deserve our sympathy & understanding. They are refugees because
209 T.A.W. is now an AE line! (oh what a horrible fate for a storyboard)

248 "Who is John Galt?"
249 Sitting at her desk, watching the world thru the streaked windows of her office
250 she saw the people running around like ants on a hot tailpipe.  No green at all,
251 just concrete and steel jetting up against the skyline.  A pidgeon was the only
252 sign of animal life, darn rat with wings.  The sky was grey, not from clouds but
253 smog think and heavy covering every building, car and human and of course pigeon
254 with a fine dirty powder.  The radio cackled a forecast "More hot weather ccom-
255 ming folks, if I were you, I'd be camping out under the nearest sprinkler." The
256 weatherman tried to keep a lift in his voice, but was unable to completly conc-
257 ceal his despair.  "Tommorrow will mark a record 176 days without rain, today
258 tied a record set back in 1965."
259 
260 the report didn't touch the woman, she just blocked it out turning instead
261 to the stack of paperwork on her desk.  The phone buzzed, she picked it up
262 and set it on her shoulder mumbling "What's up Trudy?"  The voice on the other
263 end connected her to someone she really didn't want to talk to.
264 
265 A man's voice bellowed thru the line, demanding and intimidating "We need that
266 shipment now! Weve been backordered for months!  If you can't produce results
267 now, we will simply find another manufacturer...."  She listened halfheartdly
268 offeringan occasional grunt to let the man know their was someone who was 
269 actually listening to him.  She finished the conversttion by promising to meet
270 right away with production management and get back to him with the "real"
271 reason for the delay.
272 
273 She hung up the phone, knowing full well the extent of her problem.  She knew
274 the delay was due to lack of funds, old machinery and personal problems.  Not
275 quite in that order.  The  temperture had been rising inside the plant as well
276 as out.  The corporation had just averted a labor strike and was now bent on
277 reducing the drug abuse problem.  Workers were protesting loudly about required
278 testing of urine samples.  Airconditioning had been shut back to the legal
279 minimun to help save money.  Delapidated equiptment that had depreciated long
280 ago was giving up the ghost due to lack of proper maintence and heat.  And
281 of course the stockholder were pulling out in record number.
282 
283 Quite a bit for the executive to handle, she had taken the job a year ago,
284 a fresh faced kid out of Harvard.  Excited about the "challenge" that lay
285 ahead.
286 
287 So many questions to which the answers seemed obscure and unreachable.

390 To the person wxo called me a twit: I'm sorry about any problems if you 
391 see them.  They are mostly , i would guess, due to the fact that I'm
392 calling BW on a long-distance basis! I'm sorry if you see anything that 
393 implys me as a twit.  I hate the fact that they (otter and ferret)
394 started this lousy debate! it's driving my transistors crazy and it's
395 making my circuixs jumble!
396 Well all, I'm off to do some good deeds for someone. I only wish someone
397 would GIVE me some good deeds to do. I mean, look at me, a perfect copy 
398 (well, not exactly perfect, but semi-perfect.) of Alex Rogan.  He's
399 off saving the Universe and I'm bored. Got any jobs for a duplicator 
400 droid in inisfal?
401 Observer: i jumped out of the truck and ito the shadows where the camera
402 couldn't see me. I then got up and fixed the small problem in my chest/
403 stomach unit and then trodded down the road after the Mags(?) girl, I 
404 never caught up with her.  Too bad.
405 but I'm alive and kicking. Ow! Excuse me, a small mosquito just tried to
406 get some blood but it got some jolts instead. Bye now! keep the machine 
407 beta units xcoming!
408 Cistop Mikey: WHAT WAS THAT PICTURE? IT LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN UNDER A TREE

474 Observer:   John Galt who is he?           John Gaunt is of no interrest
475                                            to this story.  Oh, so you are
476                                            a graduate of Harvard to be

481 The digital clock on her desk gave a raspy wheze signaling quiting time.
482 Quiting time for those whom work below following orders and taking home
483 a paycheck to nagging wives and snot nosed kids.
484 
485 She streched out her legs, placing them carefully on the top of her desk
486 as not to disturb the paper monsters that lay in wait.  Leaning back,
487 hands behind her head she closed her eyes and wished lightning would
488 strike.  Easy enough, no more problems except the small detail that
489 lighting in it's natural form doesn't strike inside.
490 
491 A voice brought her out of her self pity mode. "Clara, Ive got the info
492 you were asking about."  She looked up to see Wayne, standing by her desk
493 with a legal sized folder in hand.  In trying to regain her posture she
494 awoke the paper monster who flew the coupe.  Wayne bent down to help her
495 capture the flying devils as she straighten  her skirt and read over the
496 info provided.

579   The piper drained his glass as the bard finished his song.  The common
580 room of the inn was showing its warm and worn surfaces covered with
581 litter -- the debris of less than fully civil conversations.  The warm summer
582 evening entered through the thick wooden door, filtered through the rowan tree
583 outside the entrance, stroking the candle flames with gentle fingers to make
584 the light filling the inn tremble in the evening's gloom.  The piper looked
585 at the bard seating himself and applying the proper lubricant to a throat
586 dry from singing.
587   "What we need," the piper suddenly said, "is another tour."
588   Catching the startled look the bard flung, the piper continued.
589   "You know what I mean -- an outing, an excursion.  Oh, I know," he continued,
590 "that we're not disciplined enough for any sort of organized adventure, but
591 if we just set out to see some different part of reality, we end up in enough
592 trouble to satisfy anyone's lust for adventure."
593   He sat for a few moments rolling the ale mug between his palms.
594   "I long to hear the song of crystal birds tinkling through the prismatic
595 stillness of an enchanted forest, or the thunder of an abstract waterfall
596 of ideas leaping off a precipice of reason into an indefensible conclusion."

599     "Steaming tendrills, and all that,"  Said the Former quite sternly.  After
600 a safe period, he laughed out loud.  Slowly he began to realize that only a few
601 people were also laughing.
602     The rest were going through the motions of thinking.  Rubbing their jaws
603 seriously, as if on the verge of screaming "Eureka" or something equally weird.
604     "I suppose one of us knows somewhere to go,"  Said someone non descript.
605     "I suppose.  But I don't think any of us wants to risk being wrong,"  Posed
606 the same non descript person from inside the shadows.
607     "No one minds a mistake when it is made with good intention, so tell us, do
608 you know somewhere interesting to both get to, and be?"  Asked the Former quite
609 sternly.  This time he did not burst into laughter afterwards.
