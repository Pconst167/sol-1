23 
24     You came upon a storm filled night,
25        bringing light into my life
26          and rainbows to my eyes. 
27 
28          And now like in my youth, 
29     I find I am searching for the gold 
30         at the end of that rainbow.
31   Oh please let me find that gold at the end
32         of the rainbow that is you.
33 
34     It feels like I'm chasing a rainbow,
35        always just outside my reach.
36  Yes, it feels like I'm chasing rainbows again.
37 
38      Oh, please let me find that gold,
39         for I need someone to hold.
40 And it feels like I'm chasing rainbows again.

42  Yes, it feels like I'm chasing rainbows again.

64     |_|_|_|_|_|_|, I warned you it was an emotional issue. You read a lot
65 into it that was not stated or intended, but only existed in your mind. The
66 only point was its not necessarily a virtue! (P.S. I'm not the infamous SC)
67     Guardian, make it one of the Inn's famous nut-brown ales and you've got
68 it. How about this for openers?:
69  Imagine, if you will, that at one time you were in possession of
70  ultimate truth. In knowing this truth you became aware that you
71  would, at some future time, forget this truth. By the same token
72  you would also know where to inscribe this truth so as to be able
73  to find it again. Where might you have chosen as this place?

76 -alchemist-  I think that that makes two offers now...  I'll have to take you up on yours. Yes very intriguing (hosp?)
77      (I meant sp... grrr)  Your question brings as much intrigue as well. My selection of a place would seem rather odd beein
78 being that it would be on an inside rather than on something. What it would be, I won't say since I thought  I was supposed 
79 to be the cryptic type person here (CRYPTAC).
80      As to reading things into your writing, I can understand how they do it. I think that some people are taking some of
81 it too personaly, rather than letting it rest as a statement.
82 NOW, let us make way for those more intent in continuing the stroy lines...

102 The party at Dr. Elizondo's would have been memorable even without the ex-
103 plosion across the hall. There were lots of tropical plants, a tank of iri-
104 descent fish, hangings of zebra and goat skin and a startling collection of
105 voodoo masks as well as an unlimited supply of champagne and elegant food.
106 The armed Rajneeshi hovering about the door intrigued rather than frightened
107 me, and I would have been quite at ease but for the gnawing remembrance of
108 my earlier behavior with Fleming.
109 When it came right down to it, I had withheld information from the NET 
110 solely because I didn't like Fleming's socks. As I have mentioned, he 
111 enjoyed being disguised as a tennis player or jogger and on these occa-
112 sions always wore spotless white socks that came up to exactly the same
113 spot on each calf, were never even the tiniest bit uneven like other peo-
114 ple's and never needed pulling up. To me, this excessive fastidiousness
115 combined with his obsession with the NET rulebook, his habit of sterili-
116 zing anything he ate with or slept on, and the fact that he never laughed
117 at my jokes added up to a positively Teutonic mania for order that bor-
118 dered on the compulsive.
119 Still.
120 He *was* a NET agent.
121 Even though he had once refused to bring in two Morroccan heroin smugglers
122 because the description of "Method of capture" given by L'homme for the file
123 was "overindulgence" accompanied by a requisition for $3000.00 worth of 
124 curry powder from an agent for harem dancers (Fleming regards proper paper
125 work as a sacred trust). Even though he had wasted weeks during the McKane
126 incident staking out an Eastern Orthodox priest in Oklahoma City simply
127 because he liked Albanian olive oil (prompting the normally placid Ian to
128 give him a longish assignment in Rarotonga). Even though he wore those mad-
129 denning impeccable socks.
130 Still.
131 He's on MY SIDE. And that's what counts.
132 Isn't it?
133 The explosion made the neon fish swirl about vibrantly while the masks, 
134 briefly illuminated, winked knowingly.  I waded to the hallway (the carpet
135 seemed three feet deep) and saw Joshua (found at last!) with L'homme and
136 Fellows and some other people. I felt elated and wanted to wave at them
137 and tell Joshua what a relief it was to see him, but they were moving off
138 in a funny jerky kind of way like they were behind wavy glass. I laughed,
139 feeling the top of my head rise slightly to let the giggles escape.
140 The Rajneeshie stood beside me. Now in what way, thought I, was he any worse
141 than a NET agent? He was an idealistic fellow doing, in the name of justice,
142 nothing that NET agents don't also do in the name of justice.
143 His clothes were made of a curious material that glowed from within and 
144 rippled softly although there was no breeze.
145 "So you held out on Fleming, eh, EX-agent Minsky?"
146 I could barely make sense out of this because a stream of musical notes 
147 dancing with hats and canes strutted out of his mouth as he talked and 
148 formed a teeny chorus line on his shoulder.
149 "Held out.  Yes.  EX ??!?!?!??" U  Uh-oh.
150 I stared at him. His eyes looked like the eyes on peacock tails and he 
151 smiled like a Chrysler.
152 "Don't worry, Gaudy, you won't be out of work.  We think you have a great
153 deal to offer. How would you like to work for us?"
154 It occurred to me that I had been drugged. I felt happy and trusting and
155 flattered although part of my mind kept saying "dangerdangerdangerdangerdang
156 erdangerdangerdangerdang"
157 I smiled being careful to hold on to my ears so my mouth wouldn't wrap 
158 around all the way and cut off the rest of my head.
159 "I'm not in a position to make such a decision at this time," I said chortl-
160 ing at the way my words formed as cloudy wisps in the corner.

163 "...I told Camille that she was very lovely.  Dragons, for all of their good
164 points, are terribly vain.  Fortunately for me, Camille was not an exception to
165 the rule.  The whole conversation went something like this:
166 "'How are you today, dragon?', I asked.
167 "'Hungry', Camille said.
168 "'What?  Isn't there a handsome strong male dragon around to court such a
169 beautiful dragon?', I said.
170 "Of course, since dragons are as intelligent as they are, Camille knew that
171 I was just flattering her to save my skin.  Still, I had pleased her for a
172 moment, and she didn't eat me.
173 "'No, there is no male here.  All I see is a delicious human moving his
174 mandibles.'
175 "At this point, I couldn't resist.  I Changed.  Into a male dragon, of course.
176 I couldn't hold the shape long- I was inexperienced and a dragon-form is a lot
177 of mass that hs to be projected.
178 "'You ARE an interesting human.  I have never seen one of your kind assume
179 other shapes like the doppleganger.  Tell me, how do you do that?'
180 "I was shocked.  Dragons were supposed to know everything.  I suppose that 
181 Changing was invented by man, and that Changers were too rare to be seen by
182 dragons.  In any case, Camille hadn't ever seen a Change before.  I used it to
183 my advantage.
184 "'And what will I receive in return, dragon, for the knowledge I will give
185 to you?', I said.  This was dangerous- most other people would be lucky to
186 return alive in this situation.  But I had interested her, and suprised her
187 (which is something almost unheard of in dragons, surprise), so Camille felt
188 generous.
189 "'I shall give you a ring from my hoard, tell you my name, and let you go free.
190  Will you agree?'
191 "A name is the most valuable thing you can get from a creature- for if you 
192 have its name, you can exert some power over it.  Of course, the ring and my 
193 life were also large considerations.  I consented, and told her the beginnings
194 of Change-lore.
195 "She seemed pleased, and bade me to take a ring of my choosing.  As I searched
196 through the tremendous pile of gems, jewelry, and weapons, Camille Changed
197 into several things: a bird, a toad, even a duck.
198 "Finally, I found a good ring.  Camille, finally, had found a good shape- that
199 of a human girl.
200 "The shape in itself is not dangerous, but Changing itself is.  Let me explain.
201 To Change, you must temporarily surrender part of your identity.  The key word
202 here, of course, is TEMPORARY.  The longer one remains in a shape, the harder
203 it becomes to change back.
204 "Camille, as I found out a few months later, remained in the girl-form much
205 of the time.  At the last, she had been in girl-form for about two months.
206 Suddenly, she was no longer a dragon, but a young girl.  She was adopted by
207 loving and understanding parents in a villiage nearby.  When word got out that
208 the dragon disappeared, the hoard was soon gone.
209 "I returned after I had heard the news to see what I could do.  But, try as I
210 might, I could not discover which girl was Camille.  She was to be a dragon
211 no more.
212 "Still later, about another two months, the village found out who was Camille.
213 Apparently, she had remembered her true form and had tried to fly.  The
214 mess she left at the foot of the cliff was not a pretty sight.
215 "And the point of this, you all ask?  Merely be yourself, for if you try to
216 assume another's form disaster will result.
217 "There is, however, a loose end to my story.  The ring that I chose among all
218 those in Camille's hoard was magical.  The magic, however, I have yet to
219 discover how to work.  One of the reasons I came here is to see if one of the
220 patrons here has any experience with rings, and if he/she could help me."

250                           A FAMILAR VOICE
251 
252    I sat up in the dark and stared at the glowing numbers on the 
253 clock.  The little voices in my head were screaming at one another
254 for the second night in a row. Some of them weren't happy, they 
255 wanted to leave.  I didn't know why yet, let's hope I have grown 
256 past the attention getting stage.  I would hate to be that trite.
257 And if I said I wanted to leave now I would have to give an explain-
258 ation, and I didn't have one.  
259    Next to me was the nicest person (god that sounds sappy) I had 
260 seen since my divorce.  And one of my voices kept screaming to get
261 out of here.  It didn't make any sence.  I was happier than I had 
262 been in a year and this guy wouldn't let me sleep.  This was what I
263 had said I had wanted, just someone to be with without the pomp and
264 all the hassle.  Someone to fill the gaps when I felt the gaps. 
265 Someone to share with, someone I could talk to, or not talk to.
266    So why was this so insistant.  And why so familiar?  Why was this
267 particular refusing me sleep.
268    This voice had whisper black things before my wedding, and had
269 laughed when I went to pick up my divorce papers.  It was a cruel, 
270 I-told-you-so voice, a sadist.
271    I got up slowly, and dressed without turning on the light.  I
272 didn't even look at the softly breathing form on the bed, but the
273 sound of that breath roared in my ears.
274    I felt like a coward for not saying good-bye.
275    At home I turned over one and went to sleep.

280 A mouse can be useful at times, but it is distracting to have to take 
281   your hands off the keyboard--the best way to do it is to have the 
282   mouse on the floor.  It takes a bit of practice, but it gives you that
283   "third hand" you need for some programs...  What is needed in programs
284   is a way to switch off the menus as you become more proficient with 
285   it.  An ideal way(to me) to have a program set up would be to have a
286   program call a separate menu routine; when the user becomes suffic-
287   iently proficient(say that fast 3 times) that the menus get in the way
288   the program would no longer call the menu routine--and reduce the size
289   of the program.                            The Crimson Blues

331   Meanwhile, on an uncharted tropical isle, somewhere in the labyrinthine
332 folds of the fabric of multiple realities, the piper is running down a white
333 coral beach.  Running beside him, a white pegasus dips her muzzle, and with
334 a feather touch against one bare foot brushes it slightly, and causes the 
335 piper to land in the shallow water in an incredible mixture of water, sand
336 and laughter.  The pegasus moves to stand beside him, the bright tropical
337 sun glancing off her flanks revealing only a thin line where the cruel claws
338 had inflicted grevious injury.  The pegasus wheels and darts away as the
339 piper reaches for her neck.  Only a slight tightening of the eyes betrays his
340 concentration as he watches her motions -- alert for any telltale hesitation
341 or stiffness in her motions.  The two play an improvised game of tag for
342 several more minutes, then the piper throws himself to the sand in the shade
343 of a picture-postcard palm tree.  The pegasus folds her legs and lies near
344 him in the soft warm sand.
345   "Peg, you're healing up fine," said the piper caressing the pegasus'
346 warm nose.  "We might be able to try a flight or two soon."
347   The pegasus' intellegent eyes gleamed.  Her ears assumed a new angle,
348 indicating interest.
349   "We've got to take it slowly, though," the piper continued.  "Your
350 muscles were pretty badly cut up in that last fight."  He sat up and began
351 running his hands over the pegasus' body.  "This cut," he continued,
352 "damaged your major flight muscles.  It seems to have healed right, but
353 it's bound to have weakened from disuse.  Peg, we've got to start exercising
354 your flying muscles before you try to fly again."
355   The pegasus turned her neck and rested her head against the piper's side.

358 ME/ALL:
359        It is interesting how the sexs express affection.The need for men to label things that thay feel affectio
360 to as feminine is not suppriseing.Men allways,it seems,have fely that their was something unnatural in giveing le
361 to something that was not labeled female.As though, their masculinity rests on the gender of their most adored
362 posestions.
363        Women don't seem to have this need.Perhaps it is that women have learned that affection is merely an aspect
364 of humanity.It is as much a part of masculinity as it is romance.While the man(perhaps subconcisely) sees it 
365 still as a weakness.
366       Just a thought....

377      Spray from the crashing surf stretchs its fingers into the air,
378 spreading into a fine mist by the time in reaches my perch high above the
379 beach.  The water swirls and boils angrily on the rocks, then sullenly
380 draws back in preparation for another sortie in its eternal war against the
381 land.  Gulls soar and dive nearby, quarreling noisily over food, or perhaps
382 they are in heated debate about the ramifications of some delicate point of
383 Laridaeian philosophy.  And I see that the fog is beginning to creep
384 landward, enveloping the beach and slowly obscuring my view of the world
385 around me.  Ah, this day might certainly rate high on someone's fog index,
386 if only they could find a way to properly measure it.
387  
388      Standing, I realize that my legs have gone to sleep, and I am colder
389 than I had thought.  I should really be getting back to the motel soon
390 before I become the home for a family of pneumococcus!  It's a long climb
391 down, and with feeling just beginning to return to my legs, I'll be slow
392 for the first part of the trek.  Arrrgh!  I have heard this feeling
393 described as "exquisite agony", and I rediscover the accuracy of that
394 phrase once again.  Stumbling occasionally, I descend along the somewhat
395 overgrown path, past trees whose forms have been fixed in a strange
396 grasping shape due to the wind that blows constantly from the sea.
397  
398      As I round the bend that leads onto the last portion of the path I can
399 see the motel to the east, and I scan the long stretch of beach that
400 separates the motel from this promontory I see..... OH SHIT!  There's water
401 below!  Stupid, stupid, stupid!  I begin to run, as well as I can run while
402 going downhill, and much faster than is safe.  Slipping, sliding, sometimes
403 falling, picking myself up again without slackening my pace, I fly down the
404 path.  My coat catches on a limb and tears, another branch slaps me
405 stingingly across the cheek, but I pay little attention in my growing fear.
406 How could I be so foolish?  Lost in thought, communing with nature, I so
407 lost track of time that I may have trapped myself into a cold and perhaps
408 even deadly night up here.  Nature is beautiful, but she is also fierce and
409 unforgiving of stupidity, an attribute that I sometimes display overmuch.
410  
411      When I reach the bottom I can see that the water is moving slowly, but
412 I'm separated from clear beach by a good distance.  Grabbing a large stick
413 nearby, I poke it down into the water and find to my relief that it's only
414 about two feet deep here.  I step down into the water and begin to walk
415 toward the motel, but I find that the current in the water is swifter than
416 I had thought at first.  Though the water is shallow, the pull below the
417 surface is great, and I find that I am having a hard time maintaining my
418 balance as I move forward.  Suddenly, the current grows stronger, my feet
419 are pulled out from under me, and I fall.  The cold of the water, combined
420 with the strength of fear, helps me to regain my feet, and I reach the
421 beach in short order.
422  
423      Back in my room, having taken a long hot shower, I begin to relax in
424 my robe in front of the plastic log in the fake fireplace of the cheap
425 beachfront motel.  I'm still shivering from the cold, and from the fear of
426 what almost happened.  "What fools these mortals be" cried Puck, and
427 tonight I not only proved that I can be a fool but nearly demonstrated my
428 mortality as well.  But even in the worst of events a lesson can be
429 learned, and a smile curls the corners of my mouth.  For one who sometimes
430 decries the uselessness of existence, I certainly clung strongly to life
431 when the time came.  An interesting point, and one that will be remembered
432 for at least a week I'm sure.

454   I spotted Raza a long way down the beach. He was trudging along in a
455 determined stride. His shirt and tie were thrown over his shoulder but he
456 still had those shoes on. I placed my own foot on the cool green moss and
457 felt the tingle of the connection. It was obvious from Raza's walk that he
458 was not going to want to climb up the hill. I should go down to the beach
459 and meet him.
460    Walking down the flower lined path I paused frequently to smell the
461 blossoms and marvel at the many colors and patterns. This was one of my
462 favorite walks. Part way down I climbed one of the trees to pick a luscious,
463 ripe mango for Raza. They can be so refreshing on a warm day. Before I knew
464 it I was standing under the palm trees at the edge of the beach. Raza was
465 past the end of the cove heading this way. I started walking toward him.
466 It's amazing how many things can run through your mind in a few seconds of
467 walking toward someone, anticipating meeting eye-to-eye.
468   "Hi Love, I'm so glad you decided to come back." I held out my arms to
469 Raza. As our eyes met my heart seemed to skip a beat. For a moment we held
470 each other and time melted away into that endless moment of ecstasy. All too
471 soon the tensing of his muscles brought me back to the present. He let go of
472 me, stepped back  and gave a long searching look.
473   "Magen..."
474   I took his hand and started toward the shade of the nearest palm tree. "I
475 brought you a ripe mango. Why don't we sit over here while you refresh
476 yourself from that walk in the hot sun?"
477   "I appreciate the thought but I've got to talk to you. Anyway I'd get
478 mango all over my clothes. Those things are so juicy and drippy."
479   "Have you forgotten how to eat a mango too! Just take off your clothes and
480 wade out into the water up to your neck. After you finish eating duck your
481 head under water and shake it." I smiled, and a little laugh bubbled out.
482   "I'm afraid I don't have time for jokes. I came over here to have a
483 serious talk with you about this preaching in the market on saturdays. Do
484 you realize a kind of a cult following is forming around some of your ..er
485 unusual ideas?"
486   "I was hoping we could be here together and just watch the sunset. If we
487 must talk I'd like to start off by saying I still love you very much."
488   "Yes Magen, I love you too, but you've got to stop some of this stuff your
489 doing and saying. Some people are starting to say your getting a little
490 crazy. Why don't you try to be reasonable. The power plant is here to make
491 life better for all of us."
492   "I hope this doesn't qound like I think I'm something special, but there
493 are times when I feel like the only person with sight, trying to explain to
494 the blind what it's like to see. In this case it's not that people are blind
495 it's that they have forgotten. Forgotten something essential."
496   
497 ---My goodness, gone two days and I seem to have missed a disk, or part of one.
498    I guess it has to happen to all of us sooner or later.

508  decided that that is not the best right now.  The wall is indeed high, and
509  it has been up for a long time.  If I said anything now I would lose the
510  chance to do the writing that I need the most, the kind that takes all the
511  dirt and poisons out of my head and puts them onto the screen.  
512    Sometimes it is such a pleasure to reach back and flip the swich and watch
513  those words disappear.  I can't lose that right now.

558 possible to tell from the words the person used in a certain case, sometimes.
559 Some phrases are used by women more than men.  But even then it would be hard
560 to spot who is who. It is hard to tell but we should allow people to have
561 thier own privacy. Sticking my nose into people's business wouldn't be right.
562 They might get a little crabby about it.
563   There is another factor that is noticable, the ladies get more attention
564 than the men do. Unless the guy makes a bad ussumption about another person 
565 then they usually don't get the mail that the ladies do. But anyway, people
566 should be allowed thier secracy if they want it.

576 (UPI Vancouver, WA)  A convoy of US Army trucks was hijacked today as
577 they moved from Seattle to Ft. Lewis.  While authorities will not 
578 comment on whether nuclear weapons were involved, an unnamed source
579 revealed that a "small shipment" of conventional weapons was taken.
580 Included in the shipment were Ingram sub-machine guns, thermite grenades
581 and classified communications gear, as well as a great deal of other
582 weaponry.  The motive for the theft is unknown at this time, but local
583 authorities, according to outgoing Portland Police Chief Ron Still, are
584 "preparing for the worst".  While no group or individual has yet claimed
585 credit for the theft, they are expected to soon.  "You don't steal this
586 kind of firepower without a reason", said Lt. General Bruce "Bloody 
587 Butts" Irwin.

590 PAM: another nice entry.  Was that the plastic fireplace log & electric
591 flames I overread you speaking to Mr. Wassir about on another board?
592 If I recall correctly, you did end up hosting that family of pneumo-
593 cocci.  Not a total loss, though, as it gave rise to another profitable
594 (from our point of view) visit to the Inn.
595 All: Prometheus Hawthorne (you remember him - he's the one that uses up
596 a years' quota of periods in one entry) and Lady S. have asked me to
597 remember them to you all.  It seems they are experiencing that all-too-
598 familiar problem--continuous busy signals while trying to access 
599 BackWater.  They vow to return ASAP, but given the recent accessibility
600 of our favorite board, who knows when that will be?
601 P. Smith: given the state of interpersonal relations these days, it's
602 a rare person who has 'enjoyed' adulthood for very long who has NOT

624   I often feel depressed, and sometimes Backwater provides the proper outlet for expressing myself, especially now.
625   I lifted my head, the couch was cracking my neck, it was now hard to move. There would be no sleeping on this couch.
626   I sat up, letting the sheet fall to the sides, and twisted my neck trying to shake off the pain.
627   In twisting, I saw her sleeping, on the bed. Softly I heard a nice little whistle. She did not appear to be breathing, it
628 was serene to watch the perfect curves of her female form.
629   I allowed myself one more look at my sleeping girlfriend, and then stalked off to the closet, in search of a pillow.
