29 Fred found what PC&S meant, but unfortunately, too late.  I arrived a few hours later and could not disern at all if
30 one of the people there was an agent.  I cursed my rotten luck again.
31 I sat down, and waited.  Perhaps a drink would help me.  I got up and got a beer from the bar.
32 I sat down again, all the vigor from the morning gone.  I proceeded to stare into the foam of my drink and mope.
33 Something caught my eye.  A small scrap of paper peeked out from underneath the top of the table.  I tugged at it, 
34 and it came loose from the chewing gum that had held it in place.
35 Despite the stickiness, the paper was still clearly legible.  It read at the top, "E.F. Farley".  The rest of the 
36 paper was composed of five-letter blocks of code.
37 I nearly screamed with the frustration that had built up inside me.  Another cryptic note was all that I needed at
38 the moment.  I studied the paper more closely, hoping beyond hope that it was all just an elaborate joke.
39 Nope.  The code still remained, although it seemed different from all the ciphers I had been dealing with.  Odd 
40 characters sprang up at peculiar intervals, dotting the codified landscape on the scrap I held.  I finished the beer.
41 Shuffling out the door, I signaled Fred who still waited in the Hilton garage.  "Fred, another cipher.  This one has 
42 priority over the rest.  The stuff you've been digging through is old, but this one seems new, thus more valuable."
43 Ignoring the stares that I provoked, I recited the cipher through the 'com to him.
44 Those stares were nothing compared to the ones my 'com got when it replied (with Fred's voice): "Ok, Farley.  How 
45 soon will you be back?"
46 "Soon, Fred.  Listen, is the term still in your trunk?"
47 "If you mean that keyboard thing, yes, it's still there.  Why do you want it?"
48 "It's government make, and has a built-in ID string.  I can log on to any government computer."
49 "Why, for heaven's sake?"  Fred, I thought, you'd better stop listening to human figures of speech.
50 "I want to know where John has been assigned.  Perhaps there will be information on the NET in there, too."

53 I'm amazed, every time I call the people get more and more inept.  It's really
54 incredible how much people worry about doing the right thing, trying to impress
55 people they have never met or will never know.  People who don't care and 
56 wouldn't give them a second glance.  Who cares what computer you use, how wide
57 your screen is, if you don't like graphic art, if you don't like 80 columns.
58 Who are you trying to impress?  I list the new messages and one looks really
59 good, I read it and like it a lot, then I see the name "NET" and I get up and
60 go get something to eat.  Personaly, NET stories and CODES make this a hard
61 board to handle.  This so called elite, speacial group leave coded messages
62 about people they don't like or new people.  What are they trying to hide????
63 They have something to hide????  And this new wave of computer kids.  They just
64 get the expensive preasent and they call here.  Why?  did they have to try abd
65 become one of the speacial?  Why try when they know it is impossible.  Like
66 why am I entering this message?  Good question, it will probably be deleted
67 like all the rest, a lone voice, deleted!  I leave this note for it is my
68 opinion.  If you don't like it I can't help that.  The "NET" should try and
69 see both sides to this.  And why are you guys writing about such a thing when
70 this is an Inn?  A MEDIEVAL Inn, wine and chip chip chierio stuff.  Not 
71 computers and people shooting each other.  MEDIEVAL- a long time ago if you
72 don't know what that means.  But who cares?  This is a place where people can
73 have a say, and then get deleted.  People who try and monopolize a BBS??????
74 and the funny thing is they are doing it too.  They leave so many messages it's
75 hard for anyone else to get on.  But who cares????  Not I.
76 
77 ........................................................................
78 To the person above: As far as I know no msgs have been deleted. However
79 every time a disk fills up it is shifted to drive b (type db & you will
80 be using that drive. type da to return to this one)
81 As for the complaint about line lengths the guy was just saying that he
82 can't read anything past the 80th position on the line (he is not the first
83 to have this problem). He was ASKING if people could use shorter lines, so
84 that he could read their entries. Is there something wrong with that?
85         Finally, as to the comments about the art. As was stated, BWMS 
86 stores 1 line PER SECTOR on the disk. Thusly the art (and msgs with short
87 line lengths ) do make the disk fill up faster. *I* might suggest that they
88 try drawing their art on it's side ( thus instead of 20 lines at 10 
89 characters per line, they'd have 10 lines at 20 characters..)
90        Oh yes, I almost forgot - the NET authors DO participate in the Inn
91 stories, but with different characters! We've had complaints about "all
92 that fantasy junk". How would you feel if we'd backed off?

94 AP--QUM, IRAN    It was reported today by Irani authorities that the Iranian
95 Revolutionary Council and McKane Industries have signed a 5 year, multi-
96 million dollar contract for the importation of hairless chipmunks.  Irani
97 spokesman, Rashid Rezeich, denied rumors that the lovable chipmunks would
98 be used to bolster Iran's diminishing food supply.  "That is a ridiculous
99 assertion," said Mr. Rezeich.  "The chipmunks will be humanely used in 
100 medical research to find a cure for that dread disease, viral hemorrhoids."
101 
102 In a related note, Leroy McKane, founder and CEO of McKane Industries, was
103 seen entering the Iranian Interior Ministry late this afternoon.
104 Accompanied by his bodyguards/masseurs, Wendell and Maurice, Mr. McKane
105 refused comment on the chipmunk issue, stating only, "I'm not Leroy McKane,
106 he's dead.  I'm an itinerant rug merchant.  Now go away, or my boys will
107 rip your lungs out."  This reporter will provide late breaking details on
108 this story as they become available.

112  Lights. Camera. Action. Action? Fellows was in no mood for action. The events
113 from the previous night were still vivid in his memory. The bruises were also
114 very evident, in every part of his body capable of emitting pain. His head was
115 especially sore. The thugs he met last night seemed to enjoy pummelling him
116 about the face and neck.
117  There had been nearly 20 of them, and since this wasn't some Chinese backlot
118 where they were filming 'Master of the Flying Guillotine', or 'Street Gangs of
119 Hong Kong', he hadn't stood a chance. If it were only a movie. 
120  It was amazing he was still alive. When the survivors of the initial assault
121 finally got the best of him, he figured it would be the end. To find himself
122 still on this earth was the biggest surprise of his life. He felt no remorse
123 for the few of the 20 that wouldn't be telling their grandchildren how they
124 helped capture a NET agent. 
125  The images in his eyes were becoming clearer now, as were the images in
126 his head. Examining himself, he seemed to still be in one piece. Sure it
127 hurt like hell, but that would go away soon enough... He hoped. Swinging
128 his legs off the low cot, he finally took a good look at the room around 
129 him. 
130  Certainly not the plush surroundings he was used to, having operated for
131 the last five years in Europe, but he had also been in places far worse.
132 A metal door with a small barred window appeared to be the only way in or out.
133 A solitary chair completed the stark furnishings. Lighting was handled by the
134 proverbial bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. He tried to get up, to look
135 out the small window in the door, but he was still too weak to accomplish 
136 such a feat.
137  His attempts at movement were halted by sounds emanating from the outer hall.
138 Footsteps, coming this way. He could barely make out two sets of voices. He
139 was sure one of them was female, the other a New York accent by the sounds of it.
140 It appeared he was about to be questioned. He had to be on his guard. No doubt
141 the reason he was not killed was to extract information from him. Let them
142 bring on the Sodium Penathol! My NET training won't fail me now.
143  But even NET training hadn't prepared him for what came through the door. It
144 couldn't be, but it was! Rajneesh Dangerfield himself, has come-a-callin'.
145                                                Fellows

153 Mikey: Have you ever seen a 78H05? It appears to be 5 7805s in one device. I
154  first thought it was a power transistor, but after looking at the numbers,I
155  got a real shock (figuratively). This device is on a New LNW Model II, heat
156  sinked on the chassis. I think I may need another one. Any ideas on where?

160 L'homme: sure I've heard of it. I use to get them at Radar.
161 I don't know if they still carry them, but if not, you might
162 try Norvac.  It's not too uncommon of a part. National Semic
163 onductor has a 10 amp one last time I was fooling around with 
164 that stuff. I forget the designation, but I don't see a whole 
165 lot of use for the bugger, you had to practically water cool
166 the thing to make it work, and there are much simpler ways
167 to do it with power transistors instead. But I guess if you need
168 that sort of thing it is there. 
169 **********************************************************************
170 To person above who seemed a bit peeved at someone or thing:
171 As far as I know, no one is mad at you, but then since you didn't
172 leave a name, it is difficult to tell. 
173 As was stated above, there have been no major deletions that I am aware 
174 of here.  I have deleted some thrashing around that has occured, massive 
175 carriage returns, misc. commands put in while in enter mode, multiple 
176 partial incomplete downloaded messages, ect., but not normal messages. 
177 By the tone of your message, I gather that you are a new user, so 
178 perhaps some explanations would help. 
179 The disk movement has been explained already. As have some other things. 
180 One thing you should be aware of is that if you hang up while still in
181 enter mode, your message will be lost. the system doesn't get updated
182 until you do the control C. Also, because of a deep bug in it someplace,
183 it sometimes will loose the message anyway if you don't give it the off
184 command. 99.99% of the time it will work with just the control C, but
185 because the control C was a much later patch installed by me in code
186 wich I don't have the true source for, you have to expect a few problems.
187 It use to be that you always had to do the off command to save the data.
188 By the way, BW is not a computer, it is a data entry device that got 
189 converted over to a BBS system. This is the reason for its limitations
190 and structure that you see. Basicly all I did to it was to remove a
191 few of the more dangerous commands (such as delete everything) and
192 changed some to be more suitable to a BBS format. When I tryed to dig
193 further into the code, I didn't get very far as I didn't have the
194 full source code listing, only one that was sort of close.
195 The disk space concern is due to the rapid filling and movement of the 
196 disks that occur here.  As a result, it can be a real challange to just 
197 get on the system before loosing track of the data.  
198 There are currently three groups that use the system, some of them 
199 interreact, and others don't. We have the NET folks, who sometimes drift 
200 to fantasy, then we have the fantasy types who sometimes drift to real 
201 life stories, and then the debaters who like to argue about all sorts of 
202 things and drift back to their respective groups when it's over. All of 
203 this drifting and mingling together in a melting pot of creativity. 
204 Sometimes they work together as a group, or a couple of them work 
205 together on a shared plot, or many times singularly. There is sometimes 
206 an inevitable clash of ideas and concerns in this as is to be expected. 
207 There is nothing new about this, anytime something has been around for a 
208 while be it a story line, or something physical, it gains a degree of 
209 personal attachment, and disruption of it can hurt greatly. Thus the 
210 great amount of halabaloo when it happens. On the other hand, when 
211 something is relativly new, there is not such a close attachment, and it 
212 can be more easily molded and formed, and there is less of a concern 
213 when someone trys to change the direction.

280   Stil buoyant from his good luck in getting an interview, Sam walked back to
281 the door, unaware of the pity in the eyes of the lady who had passed him on.
282 He pressed through the door into another office inhabited by an older man --
283 who looked in rather good shape for his age.  The man was dressed in a white
284 shirt and tie, but the white shirt had a rather bad black ink stain over the
285 front.  Actually, Dan realized, it was centered just over his heart.
286   "Sit down, Mr.    Spade? I believe."
287   Dan was ushered into a relatively comfortable chair, and prepared himself for
288 the upcoming interview.
289 ...............................
290 31/12/84
291 Input processing interview 003
292 Name:  Spade, Daniel F.   
293 Birthplace:  New York City
294 D.O.B.  4 July, 1962
295 Parents:  
296 Father -- Not attached to family.  The subject has no attachment to his
297 father, who was a well-know private detective.  His life centered around his 
298 mother, who was never married to his father.
299 Mother -- Deceased.  His mother was killed in an incident in a supermarket 
300 parking lot nearly four years ago.  She was accosted by a carful of purse 
301 snatchers who snatched her purse.  Unfortunately, she carried the purse with
302 the strap wrapped tightly around her upper arm.  When her arm finally came
303 loose from the purse, the car was travelling at high speed in heavy traffic.
304 Nearest concerned kin:  The nearest kin that could be established in this 
305 interview was a maternal uncle in Duluth, Mn.  This person has never met, nor
306 expressed any interest in the subject.
307 Reccomendation:  This one looks like he may be useful.  He's had a rough time,
308 from the look of it.  Take him down for minimum training and observation.
309   If he still looks O.K. in three weeks, send him on for deep training.
310 ..................................
311   Dan had never felt so exhausted during an interview in his life.  He now 
312 understood why the uphostered chair during the interview.  He stood up and 
313 rubbed his hip -- strange, he must have gotten a cramp sitting for so long.
314   The man wearing the ink stain stood also and offered his hand.  The words!
315   "Thank you for your time, Mr. Spade."
316   Ohghod no... the cold streets...
317   "I think we can use a man like you.  Can you go to work today?"
318   "Yes,                   Yes, of course!"
319   The man in the ink stain moved around the desk and put a fatherly had on
320 Sam's shoulder.
321   "Look son, you seem to be rather down on your luck.  Is this your last set
322 of respectable clothes?"
323   Dan swallowed a lump of embaressment.  "Yes, and they're not all that good."
324   "Do you *really* need to go back where you are staying?  Did you leave 
325 anything there that is important?"
326   "No."
327   "Well then, let's go out back.  We've got some temporary quarters out here
328 and some clothes that might fit."

361 Portland Or (UPI) - In a predawn raid in the red light district of
362 Portland Oregon, city and state police have rounded up nearly 100
363 sexual deviants and perverts, in what outgoing mayor Frank Ivancie
364 has proclaimed the biggest smut bust in the city's history.
365 At a news conference in downtown Portland, lame duck mayor Ivancie
366 told the group of reporters he was going to break with tradition
367 and personally interview each of those arrested in the raid.
368 As the sexual criminals were paraded in front of the reporters in
369 an obvious publicity stunt aimed at bolstering the sagging image
370 of the police bureau, this reporter couldn't help but notice one
371 man with blond hair and a Russian sounding name still clutching
372 a large sheep close to his person. The reporters were quickly
373 ushered out of the room when the man began shouting at the
374 group to "Leave me to my own devices!"
375 More on this story as details become available.

405   When, exactly, will it be safe to cautiously return to the margins of above
406 eighty. If it is impossible to say, right now, perhaps whenever the infrmation
407 becomes available.
408   And whoever leaves the margin at seven, why? It is a very curious size, you

429 your entry, and had come to an understanding about it.  So what do you
430 do, but let every BW critter know about it as well as getting on my nerve
431 about it.  HOW CHILDISH.  We had already settled the matter.  The *NET*
432 will for sure hear about your CHILDISH acts of ill-reput.

442  A new story, Part 1
443   "In the memory of my Grandmother - June 1910 to December 1984"
444    By John Kingman
445 |||||!!!!!
446   As the last of the moons was about to set, Erik knew that dawn would
447 soon be here.  The morning birds were already singing.  The dew was
448 thick in the air.  When was the last time he had sleeped? he taught.
449 Ever since the piper had appeared, everything had turned upside down.
450 Yes, the piper.  He and peg had almost been killed trying to get 
451 here with that message.  Now peg and the piper were recovering from
452 their ordeal, but what of the message about the evil MARJOT invading
453 from the north.  Why, already news about Calhorn failing to turn
454 the invaders had reached his ears; and with the King gone to the 
455 south on an important trade mission, Erik had to govern.  What to do!
456 He was only 14 standard years old.  So he had little time in which to
457 grow wise.  Maybe Zach would know what to do.  ...
458 |||||!!!!!|||||!!!!!|||||!!!!!|||||!!!!!
459   I hope that the brief use of peg and the piper is alright.  No other
460 reference will be used except for the message that was brought.  If 
461 this does conflict to much, just think of it as another piper and peg.
462   Maybe Piper and Peg, Jr.

475 Voyeur: My thanks a thousand times.
476 L'homme: You can spare time to call Milchar, but not me?  Now, really, that *IS* playing favorites...
477 Ian: Nasty, nasty.  This new code, that is.  If I could only determine your exact method of calculating the key...
478 #$##$##$##$##$#
479 "Fred?", I said, munching on a Big Mac aas I drove.
480 "Yes, Farley?", Fred asked.
481 "How have you been progressing on that code?", I managed to get out as I swallowed the last of the burger.
482 "None of the cipher has been deciphered yet, Farley.  Would you like to know what I have discovered so far?"
483 "Go ahead.", I said.  A piece of paper whistled by in the wind.  I reached up, and deftly snatched it.
484 "It appears to be a polycode, but a cleverly designed one.  The letter frequency is all out of whack.  I have, however,
485 determined probable words."
486 "Probable words?  What are they?"  I hadn't glanced at the paper yet for fear of what may be written on it.
487 "Probable words are those words that I have guessed are contained in the message.  If I am correct, then I can compare
488 the ciphertext and the plaintext and determine the key.  The key will unlock the rest of the cipher, so to speak."
489 "Well, what's the problem with this cipher, then?"
490 "I believe that the key is just as long as the cipher, calculated as the encipherment goes along."
491 "But what is it calculated from?  It has to start from something."
492 "Indeed it does, Farley.  In this case, I believe it starts from IANM.  Does that mean anything to you?"
493 "IANM?"  I thought for a bit.  "Didn't we hear 'Ian' through the bug at the PorSFis meeting?"
494 "Yes, we did.  That was what inspired me to try it in the first place."
495 By now, I had gathered the courage to look at the paper.  More ciphertext.
496 "Fred, here's another cipher.  It appears to be encoded as the last one is.  Here, use it to check against the one you
497 already have.  I can tell you this much- it begins as the last one did.  CPPAL PFXL[ ND."  At this point, I didn't care
498 any longer where the cipher had come from.
499 "All right, Farley.  Where to, now?"
500 "Well, I'm going to get that term out of your trunk and try that.  Just find some place to park for a while, if you
501 like.  If not, then let's explore Portland.  Maybe we'll be lucky and stumble across something."

510      The  road  to the Inn had been long and hard,  but now  Tarn 
511 stood  once again at the bridge he had so long ago stood when  he 
512 entered this land.   Where before he had stood here in pain,  now 
513 he stood in sorrow.  He had come to bid the Inn goodbye, for with 
514 Emer gone,  he found that he could no longer stay.   The memories 
515 here  were just too much to bear.   Moving towards  the  Inn,  he 
516 paused  at  the door...  Deciding against going  in,  instead  he 
517 reached  into his pocket and pulled an acorn from his pocket that 
518 he had found during his journeys in the mountains.  Stooping down 
519 at the entryway opposite the Rowan tree, he used a small stick to 
520 dig a hole and buried the acorn.   Patting the earth over it,  he 
521 stood up.   Taking one last look at the Inn,  he paused as if  to 
522 say  goodby,  but  instead moved off towards the road and  headed 
523 north  towards the wilderness,  and the northern pass out of  the 
524 valley.  Maybe someday he would return, and maybe not.

532 No, I am not a new user and the messages were not put to the second 
533 drive.  I have been around to long not to know about them.  Now I
534 read the new messages and see one from a very mad smerf.  He is 
535 going to tell on another guy because the he was childish.  He let
536 people know something that they were hiding and he didn't like it.
537 So now he runs to mom and screams bloody murder. Way to act like
538 an adult, you'll be a fine one someday, someday. and a new code too!
539 I'm just thrilled to death. I just live for new codes! I got sick of
540 them about six months ago and it
541 is here again. 
542 People always jumping to conclusions to answer what they can not.
543 You don't have any good reason in your mind for me entering these
544 messages and the ones on another disk. A story and a few other things,
545 no reason so you make up a few to help yourself out.  I was a new
546 user who didn't understand. I do understand, that's why I am here.
547 I didn't know about a second drive. It
548 's in the help file and I already know about it. 
549 I'm being childish, it may be, but I'm here and you've seen me.
550 Too late! But then again, you don't have to read this anyway, just like I don't
551 JoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshua
552    As I entered the elevator, I noticed that the Weston Benson was not immune
553 to the 13th floor phobia.  I always made a note of such things, since a time in
554 the Oklahoma City Plaza Hilton...  I pushed those memories from my mind; now
555 was not the time to be distracted with reminiscing on L'homme, Gaudy, and
556 that damnable Petrov.  The elevator was empty, as one would expect at 3 A.M.
557 I waited for the door to close, then pressed the sequence of buttons that I
558 remembered Gaudy pushing last time we were here.  Nothing happened.  They must
559 have changed the combination - annoying, but not unexpected.  Opening the
560 door, I hung my 'Out of Service' sign on the outside, then reclosed the door
561 and dropped my bag on the floor.  Rummaging inside, I withdrew my handy-dandy
562 super-agent tool kit, and began to disassemble the elevator control panel.
563 Pulling the cover off, I surveyed the exposed multicolored spaghetti, attached
564 a jumper HERE and THERE, cut THIS and THAT, plugged this thingy over there,
565 and  LO! the cage began to move downward.  As it descended, I put my equipment
566 back, crammed the wires back into the panel, and replaced the cover.  Now,
567 however, it would answer to MY code.
568    Last time I was here, this was the Portland branch of the NET.  Since the
569 reorganization, though, I wasn't sure what I would find down there.  So, as the
570 elevator began slowing, I checked my trusty Heckler & Kock VP'70Z, made
571 sure the 19-round clip was full, and stood to the side as the elevator stopped.
572 And waited.  Nothing.  So, this was not a regular entrance anymore, or the
573 NET was no longer here.  In either case, I had best be careful.  Quietly
574 reopening the control panel, I released the door lock, and slowly pried the
575 doors apart.  As soon as I could see through, I scanned the room.
576 Interesting.  There was a large potted plant right in front of the door!
577 Yes, not only was this not the usual entrance, it was apparently unknown.
578 Well, since I was here, I might as well take a look.  There didn't seem to
579 be anyone around, and people that would overlook an elevator (albeit well
580 camouflaged), didn't worry me too much.
581    I headed down the corridor, 9 mm in hand, every sense alert for traps.
582 Voices!  One of them strangely familiar...  I crept forward, until I found the
583 source.  To my left was a door, with a small barred window.  Peering in, I saw
584 two men, one sitting, apparently being interrogated by the other, standing.
585 The inquisitor was the one who sounded familiar, and even from the back, I
586 knew who it was.  A tremor ran through my body; I felt hot/cold; strange
587 thoughts ran through my head... I couldn't help myself - I opened the door
588 and stepped into the cell.  As they heard me enter, they both turned and looked.
589 The seated man looked too sunk in his own misery and fear to pay much
590 attention, but the other.....  He looked at me in surprise, then smiled.
591 "Joshua.  So, at last you return to me.  You see?  You finally realize, that
592 I am your father, your life.  Without me you are nothing.  Isn't this true?
593 Your soul was empty; I will fill it.  Come to me now, Joshua."
594 I stared at him, entranced.  My gun began to droop toward the floor, and I
595 could feel my will being drowned in his, my volition sapped.  But as I approached
596 him, some deep core of Self cried out in desperation, stirring in panic at
597 the thought of being lost.  Louder it cried, but stronger came the pull from
598 the man facing me.  My feet slowed as the struggle moved deeper into my soul.
599 Suddenly I felt Self gaining dominance, and I saw the realization reflected
600 in the eyes of my adversary.  My gun lifted again, and I looked past it at the
601 too-familiar face.  "Rot in Hell, Dangerfield," I breathed as I pulled the
602 trigger.  A small hole appeared in his forehead, a third eye.  The wall behind
603 him was suddenly splattered in red as the 135 grain hollow point expanded
604 in his brain and removed the back of his head.  As the body fell, I jerked the
605 trigger five more times, convulsively.  I looked back at the crimson pattern
606 on the wall, thinking morbidly that the Rorschach displayed there was
607 definitely his own personal interpretation.  Coming back to reality, I realized
608 that the shots had doubtless been heard, and I had best not be around when
609 reinforcements arrived.  I had not lost too much time in my daydream, though,
610 as Dangerfield's corpse was still twitching on the floor.  Yes, I could hear
611 shouts now, time to get moving.  Oh yes, the prisoner... any enemy of His was
612 a friend of mine.  "Come on," I said, "unless you want to be here when they
613 find That?"  He looked at me, undoubtedly wondering whether he'd be better off
614 with them or this madman, but finally decided to give me a try.  He KNEW what
615 Their hospitality was like.  Seeing he was following, I left the cell and
616 headed back toward the hidden elevator.  Fortunately the noise was coming
617 from the other direction.  But, as we got to the concealing shrubbery, I saw
618 chips fly from the wall, accompanied by the CRACK from behind.  Pushing my
619 companion into the elevator, I managed to close the door just as I heard
620 someone cut loose with an automatic.  I punched the button for the lobby,
621 then waited impatiently for the lift to reach possible safety.  I now wished
622 I had stashed a car in the garage for a getaway, but I hadn't expected such a
623 need.  I must be slipping....
624    As the door opened on the lobby, I looked out, but everything was quiet;
625 they hadn't gotten there yet.  We headed for the exit, trying to look casual
626 (me somewhat disheveled, him covered in bruises and dried blood!).
627 The clerk was busy trying to make the maid, so we left the building unhindered. Now, back to my apartment to get cleaned up,
628 and to find out who this pathetic looking escapee was.  JoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshua
