20 What?! No one caught my little joke about Abby Hoffman's 'Steal This Book'?
21 I'm really disappointed! Then again, maybe it is too old for you. It does

45 With everybody probably already boored to tears with the Olympics, I'd
46 still like to put in my two cents' worth about the TV coverage by ABC.
47 On the negative side, as so many others have already stated, ABC has
48 put more emphasis on American efforts and flag-waving than on balanced
49 coverage of outstanding athletic efforts irrespective of the national
50 origin of the athletes involved.  To counter this, most of the outstanding
51 performances, and I say 'most' knowing that the oversimplification will
52 get me into a lot of trouble, have been by American atheletes, or involed
53 American atheletes.  However, by reading the newspapers, there seems to
54 have been other nations competing
55 at the Olympics this year!
56 Politics and commercialism seem to be playing a bigger part of the
57 Games this year than ever before.  Perhaps the spirit of the Games should
58 be officially changed (as well as the rules) to reflect the true state
59 of the world rather than an ideal that has outlasted its time.  It seems
60 that there is really no such thing as an 'amatuer' athelete in the sense
61 that the founders of the Olympic movement saw an amatuer.  There are a
62 lot of 'professional' atheletes that really should be in these Games
63 because they are the best in the world at something the do.  The East
64 Bloc atheletes as well as MOST U.S. boxers who are members of the 
65 WELL, FOLKS, I THINK IT'S TIME TO GET SOME SERIOUS DEBATING

100 Dear Ms. Pam
101 We regret to inform you, Dr. Frankenstupe has been committed to the 
102 State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  He was discovered nude, sitting
103 on the mayor's desk in the city council chambers.  He was singing 'Moon 
104 River' at the time.  Unfortunately, the city council was in session at the
105 time.  Mr. Ivancie was quite upset and claimed Dr. Frankenstupe was an
106 agent in the employ of Bud Clark.  Whoop.  Whoop.
107 
108 We would like to bring to your attention the bill for the care and feeding
109 of this er... thing.  As they were putting the straight-jacket on poor
110 Dr. Frankenstupe, he told us it belonged to you.  We would appreciate it
111 if you would make arrangements to take possession as rapidly as possible.
112 We are running critically low on Wizard Air Freshener.  The total bill for
113 damages and maintenance is $37,846.91.  
114 
115 Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

193         could not think of an appropriate comeback.
194         2.  This country, and the world, has been in a aggressive
195         growth period since WWII.  The post war booms have been 
196         marred somewhat by recession, but never to the point where
197         we have gone back to life before the wars.  I currently work
198         about 3 minutes to buy a loaf of bread.  Prior to the Viet
199         Nam War, my father worked about 9 minutes for a loaf.  That
200         is economic progress.

275 In answer to the above: Yes, and anyone who grew up during the depression and
276 prohibition such as I did would have seen many of the above (accepting the stars
277 , champagne out of shoe, etc.).
278 I have personally seen: the shoe and cat, the "EXTRA EXTRA!" newsboy, the magi-
279 cian, the hobo, the jug of whiskey, the salesman's foot, the drunks, a safe
280 being raised up to a window from the outside (though luckily I never saw one

300         At least that's what the sign said.
301  "Shouldn't that be Mel's Eats?", asked Joshua in mock seriousness. "Just
302   josh'in.", he continued.
303  "Cute.", I replied aloud, and then to myself, "Just what I need, a comic
304   for a partner."
305         I gave the car the STOP command, and it promptly pulled over to
306 the side of the road outside the rustic looking roadside cafe. With a
307 swoosh of compressed air, the doors opened, and Joshua and I stepped onto
308 the gravel shoulder of the road.
309         "A real do-drop-in, don't you think?", I asked Joshua, as we stepped
310 up to the cafe's porch. As I reached for the door it opened for me. The
311 person behind door was the mysterious lady from the meeting! She started
312 walking for the car, and we, still in a slight state of shock, followed
313 behind her.
314         As the still-unnamed lady approached the car, the passenger door
315 opened on its own accord. Pushing the seat forward, she jumped in to the
316 backseat, and returned the seat to its former position. Joshua and I
317 got in the car, and the doors automatically closed.
318         Before we could speak, she answered our questions in a heavy mid-
319 western twang.
320   "I am Gaudy Minsky. I am your new partner, and I believe you're going my
321 way. Ian sent me on this mission, so I suggest we get going."
322         Joshua and I looked at each other, and with expressions of surprise,
323 and a slight deflation of our collective male egos, we set off for Portland.
324         In the hours our trip to Portland took, Gaudy related her entire
325 story of the meeting with our illustrious leader Ian, and how he had convinced
326 her to join in our operation against the Rajneeshies in RAINdeer. She turned
327 out to have a pretty interesting story; at least interesting enough to keep
328 Joshua and I from calling Ian immediately and asking why he had sent a women
329 along with us.
330         About 30 miles outside of downtown Portland, the car slowed down to
331 normal traffic speed, 70 MPH, in order to blend in better with the in-going
332 cars. The car was pre-programmed to head to NET - Portland, in order for us
333 to pick up some needed equipment and some clothes more typical of the area.
334         We arrived at the downtown Benson, parked the car using the 11-minute
335 nickel, and entered the building. Gaudy lead the way to the elevator, and when
336 it arrived, punched a series of numbers. There was that falling sensation
337 again! But as before, we slowed to a stop, and the doors opened to reveal a
338 small office staffed by a single secretary, and occupied by several suitcases
339 marked L.J.G.
340   "You must be the RAINdeer contingent.", the secretary said without
341 looking up from her desk. "Those marked bags are for you. Have fun in
342 RAINdeer."
343         We grabbed our bags without saying a word, and entered the elevator.
344 The flight to the lobby only took a few moments, and we were heading for the
345 door when a news broadcast on the TV in the hotel bar caught my attention.
346         A reporter identified as Kathy Hitoranagason was interviewing Ma Prem
347 Rivers, the Rajneesh mouthpiece, and Rivers was doing most of the talking.
348    "Yes. Our festival will not be stopped by the actions of a few insensitive
349 brutes. We will go on undaunted! Damn those who would stop us!"
350         With that last epithet, the picture switched back to the station's
351 newsroom, but we were already too busy heading toward the door with our bags in
352 tow to pay much attention.
353         "We better get there, and get there fast!", I shouted as we dodged
354 taxies and mopeds to get to the car. Throwing our bags in the trunk, we climbed
355 in and started the car.
356    "Autopilot", I said, and as before, the KITT-like panel appeared. The same
357 female voice asked nonchalantly, "destination please?" "RAINdeer Oregon"
358 "Desired time of arrival?" "Now!!!" I shouted, and the car immediately went into
359 motion. We were informed that the timetable given was unobtainable, but the
360 computer would do its best.
361         10 minutes later, we arrived at the outskirts of RAINdeer. Things
362 were pretty desolate in this part of town. Joshua and I looked at Gaudy, and
363 we quickly started to plan our attack.

373 Prometheus : Don't brag about your Risk past. I seem to recall bragging was
374   what got you in trouble before. You haven't played Risk until you have
375   played with the bunch.

381 L'HOMME SANS PARITY, & LAISSE-FAIRE, MY APOLIGIES. L'HOMME, YOU ARE PERFECTLY IN THE RIGHT TO CORRECT MY INEXCUSABLE TONE 
382 TOWARDS LAISSE-FAIRE. HOWEVER, ALLOW ME TO OFFER AN EXCUSE. I AM AT THE TENDER AGE OF EIGHTEEN, AND ANY CASUAL DECISIONS THAT 
383 REGAN & COMPANY MAY MAKE REGARDING THE MILITARY WILL HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON MY PRECIOUS BODY. I HAVE NO WISH TO DIE IN SOME 
384 STINKING JUNGLE IN SOUTH AMERICA, AND I VALUE MY AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. I ALSO MIGHT ADD THAT I HAVE NOTICED A DISTRESSING 
385 TENDENCY TOWARDS CONSERVATISM IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE ELECTION OF R&R. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOTHING NORMALLY WRONG WITH THIS, 
386 THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION HAS SUCCEDED IN UNITING CONSERVATISM AND MILITARISM UNDER THE SAME BANNER. ALTHOUGH THIS IS PARTLY 
387 DUE TO POLITICAL MOGULS SUCH AS JESSE HELMS, (SENATOR OF NORTH CAROLINA) WHO RECEIVE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MILITARY MONIES 
388 FOR BASES IN THEIR STATE, MUCH IS DUE TO THE MASSIVE MILITARY BUILDUP SINCE THE ELECTION. THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO PUBLIC FIGURE
389 S EITHER. EVEN PRIVATE PERSONS, PERHAPS COMFUSED BY THE RHETORIC AND PATRIOTICALY INFLAMED BY THE SPECTACLE OF GRENADA, HAVE 
390 BEGUN EXCITEDLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT 'VICTORY'. JUST LAST WEEK, THE 'OFFENSE' DEPARTMENT BEGAN THREATENING THAT 
391 THEY MIGHT RUN OUT OF MEN IN THE 1990'S AND A DRAFT WOULD BECOME 'NECESSARY'. IT IS THIS SABER RATTLING THAT RATTLES MY BONES.
392 I STILL MAINTAIN THAT WAR IS SIMPLE MURDER, AND IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE. IT IS BETTER TO DIE AND REMAIL SPIRITUALLY UNCONTAMINATED
393 BY MURDER THAN TO ENGAGE IN 'A PRETENSE OF 'SELF DEFENSE' UNDER A PIECE OF CLOTH.BY THE WAY, MY REAL NAME IS TED MITTELSTAEDT,

406 TO THOSE WHO ARE STILL WONDERING: Abby Hoffman was (is!) a 1960's hippy
407 freak pinko radical who liked to stir things up. He wrote a book called
408 'Steal This Book' which caused a lot of fuss because it described in gory
409 detail such things as how to make pipe bombs, do nasty things to ma bell,
410 what size slugs = what type coins, ect... The problem it brought up was
411 where do you draw the line on freedom of press? We can't have Uncle 
412 banning this sort of stuff, but.. is there a real need to popularize this
413 sort of information so that common vandles can get ahold of it? It really
414 pushes the freedom of the press concept to the wall.

417 Ma Prem Rivers greeted us with a warm smile.  EVERYone at RAIN-
418 deer had a warm smile.  Perpetual beatitude. Non-stop bliss.
419 It was depressing.  I was acting as a newspaper reporter with a
420 photographer (L'homme) and Joshua was from 1001 Pals of Oregon
421 investigating animal abuses and unnatural acts.  Nothing was
422 more unnatural than the unflagging ecstacy of the Rajneeshis.
423 Rivers looked like the dog Odie in "Garfield."  "Marvelous. 
424 Publicity.  I mean people confuse us with those guys in airports
425 that look like Daddy Warbucks with jaundice. Puh-LEEZ! We are
426 not a cult.  We are a legitimate religious movement." She steered
427 us through the relentlessly rapturous throng.  I was getting edgy
428 .  I'd known guru junkies of every persuasion from Herbert W.
429 Armstrong to Bubba Free John.  Drunk on the act of spiritual
430 transport and with little personality of their own, they will-
431 ingly submitted their ego to anyone willing to be known as a
432 prophet or saint.  This utter bliss could turn instantly to
433 fanatic hatred if Wassir or Petrov tried and failed to shake
434 their leader's credibility.  If they succeeded, things could
435 be even worse.  Facing thousands of devotees who had discovered
436 their idol to be a humbug would be no day at the beach.
437 It was a fine sight.  Thousands of green-clad worshippers
438 milled about joyously in a large open area with farm buildings
439 at one end and living quarters at the other.  They were hav-
440 ing a great time.  Why did it seem so ominous?  May be I was
441 just grouchy because we hadn't been able to get into the
442 trunk for 12 hours.  The rest of the car talks like the nice
443 Time lady.  The trunk sounds like Vic Tayback.  "OPEN THE
444 TRUNK?!?!?!! You think I'm a sinusoid elephant???!!" The trunk
445 was highly amused.  We were not.  "OK, OK, OK.  Guess the pass-
446 word.  What former Olympic athlete taught millions of mothers
447 how to raise their children? And what was his event?  And if
448 you try to use force I'll jam the doors, too, wiseguys, so what
449 do you think about that? HAH?!!!" A real charmer; We'll have
450 to make an addendum to the operator's manual.

475    From his seat near the edge of the bar where he had been 
476 sitting and listening to the tales, the piper rose and called to the throng,
477    "A slight change of subject, perhaps, but I would like to address the 
478 concept of "victimless" crimes.  The Portland city council is trying to
479 "crack down" on prostitution in the city.  My question is simple -- if both
480 parties are willing, who gets hurt?  Why is prostitution, taking drugs, 
481 attempting suicide, and any other act that does not infringe upon anothers
482 rights legislated as illegal?  By what stretch of the imagination can any
483 government claim to be legitimate that interferes in a persons life when that
484 person is not performing acts that affect other persons?
485    I can see the need for and reluctantly accept the right of a group of 
486 people to pass and enforce by collective violence certain rules of behavior
487 that protect each member of that group from acts committed by others.  It
488 is, unfortunately, quite easy to go from that point to a point where the 
489 group can construe protecting it's members as aiding them against all who
490 might resist the members will in any matter -- material, moral, or religious.
491    My point is, that as soon as a society crosses the line of legislating
492 behaviour which infringes upon another's rights, and attempts to regulate
493 morals, religious beliefs, or any other private behaviour, that society
494 forfeits its claim to legitimacy.

525 TED: Apology accepted.  I understand where you are in life.  I do, 
526      however, disagree about war always being murder.  In many cases
527      it is self defense, eg. WWII.  Are you advocating death rather
528      than self defense ?  Before discussing war again, I would like to
529      know if that is indeed your premise, because if it is, we have
530      such a difference in viewpoint that I feel it would be a 
531      fruitless discusion.  RSVP
532 
533 Piper:  Prostitution is not always agreeable to both sides.  Many
534         times the woman is forced into it by Pimps or other mitigating
535         circumstances.  If all are truly willing, then it is none of
536         the states business.  Read your bible, prostitution is older
537         than Christianity.  (Genesis describes temple prostitution
538         as from a primitive religion)
539         As for suicide, that usually affects a lot of other people,
540         the coroner, the family, friends, etc.  That is a much harder
541         question to discuss.  Where does ones autonomy end, and ones
542         obligation to others take precedence.
543         Drugs are another problem altogether.  I have known many people
544         who are into drugs and are productive members of society.  
545         But there are many others who through misuse of drugs become
546         burdens on society.  That is intolerable.  (This holds true
547         for that most insidious of drugs, alcohol)
548 
549 L'homme: Do you feel that a balanced budget is possible with the 
550          promised increase in social welfare programs that Mr. Mondale
551          has proposed ?  Increases which do very little other than to
552          discourage individual effort and encourage people to lay\
553          sideways in the public trough.

557 Piper - Bravo. It's about time someone else came out in defense
558 of perpetrators of victumless crimes. 
559      Though most of us don't recognize it, we are unthinking 
560 slaves to irrational values that linger from our puritan 
561 heritage. Yet rather than admit our values reflect socially 
562 instilled taboos, which may no longer be relevant, we deceive 
563 ourselves into believing that we came to our values through 
564 rational thought and examination.
565      The fallacy of this thinking was demonstrated in our 
566 earlier argument. Though people pretended to be rational,
567 logical, and scientific, their arguments made no sense at all.
568 If you examine the entrys from that period you'll see that 
569 they were emotional to the point of being absurd.
570      This is understandable once you accept that man is not a 
571 rational animal. We are basically herd animals who are 
572 motivated by fear, instinct, taboo, social pressure, along with
573 a myriad of other complex motivations. We react from instinct
574 or social conditioning. It's only later that we become rational
575 in order to justify what we do or believe.
576      When I portrayed myself as a child molester I triggered
577 familial instincts, territorial instincts, while violating the 
578 the most sacred of the social taboos. You saw the reaction. 
579      Mankind has always been motivated by the herd instinct and
580 always will. Rational thought, scientific method, and logical 
581 constructs are merely tools to create a workable illusion that 
582 gives life meaning. They are not real.
583      Since it's all an illusion anyway don't be too hard on 
584 society for not living up to your standards. Reality is a sham 
585 and things are not as they seem. Your best bet is to go off, 
586 smoke a joint, and forget the whole thing.
