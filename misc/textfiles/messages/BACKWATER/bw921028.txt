209 of nature?  Or, is the Texas Supercollider really needed by scientists 
210 today?  What happened to the billion$ of dollars spent on Star Wars?
211 Why was it that you could get little financial aid in the 80's to go
212 to college, but you could always join the Army/Navy/AirForce/Marines
213 and get FREE money?  Student loan defauts weren't THAT bad back
214 then.  How is it that we know little of Japanese culture, yet
215 Japan teaches English to ALL its students, and has adopted American
216 food, clothing, and attitudes?  Has America finally put on cultural
217 blinders and stoped accepting immigrants from other countries?  What
218 about the use of new optical holographic memories that can stor
219 large amounts of information in a small cubic crystal?  Will it ever
220 be pratical to replace hard drive subsystems with this, and what
221 kind of data rate could be sustained?

224 agree on and disagree on, it's just that the majority of people 
225 suffer from apathy.

227    Astral Dreamer, I beseech your patience.  Your timebox was currently
228 a void; I've activated it for about a day, using it's time-compression
229 feature to allow me to count prime numbers.  This probably strained
230 your timebox to the limit, as the instruments indicated it was
231 at full power.  I forgot to slow it down, so it was running full
232 tilt overnight.  I remembered this morning, went back and turned it
233 down.  It now sits idle again, with the same void.  Do not be
234 angry at this misuse; I promise to be more responsible with
235 time-control devices in the future.

241 Well Astral Dreamer, I don't understand the merits of sales tax, because I've
242 been living in Oregon all my life and we don't happen to have any (sales tax).
243 I'm not aware of the decline of IBM, because I'm using one now and the market
244 seems to be doing well for IBM and compatible products, software, etc. Music?
245 Music is a device that can be used to move the soul, and encourage emotions. I
246 like music in all forms, and yes I do mean ALL. No exclusions. Some music just
247 isn't very good, but I still appreciate it. 8) My computer is an IBM PS/1 and
248 I never knew much about it, except that it has a modem and a VGA screen. 
249 Someday I want to know more about the computer world and what all those nasty
250 terms mean so when I buy my own it will be a good one. The one I'm using is
251 generally termed the family computer, but I am the only one who uses it...
252 
253 What effects physically produced by a person's state of mind? What effects
254 produced by animals, plants, and nature? Obviously the human mind is a natural
255 object, how can it be contrary to that of animals, plants, and nature? We do
256 run on instinct you know... Our society has become an immense force in that it
257 limits the way we go about our instincts, but they are still there and must be
258 heeded accordingly. Wars will arise from overpopulation, disease will spread
259 quickly and overcome densely populated areas, and famine brings down population
260 even more as nature struggles to bring down the destructive forces of man. How
261 can either side win? If man prevails natures security clauses, he has doomed
262 himself and loses. However nature loses its dominating life form if it destroys
263 us all, perhaps for the better, but never the less an extinction of severe
264 impact on the galaxy. Well we should be able to muddle along... Nature will
265 win obviously, as our technology kills many of us, doubtfully all, and proceeds
266 it's rebuilding. In a billion years, all will be well... All is transitory. 8)
267 hahaha... Merry Christmas!!! I feel ill.. 8( I need a psychiatrist and Eliza
268 didn't help me much... I happen to have a desire to be in love, and ample
269 opportunity, but seem to be fighting myself due to past relationships dying.
270 I don't enjoy the idea that the next one will be the same, and I have no way
271 of proving that such will be the case, but the fear nags me and I shy away 
272 from the relationship I long for... I should stop shying away from it. But
273 I can't ask her for a relationship till this big ZIT on my forehead goes away.

278    I was speaking in the sense that man seems to be able to make direct
279 decisions about the environment (create an idea) and then make changes
280 as we see fit (act on the idea).  Yes, man has "instinct", but we call
281 it "intuition" because it has been through civilization and refined into
282 something else.  Other parts of nature seem to alter the environment out
283 of instinct and not direct application of thought (otherwise beehive
284 communities would be "intelligent" enough to make tools instead of using
285 the community members AS TOOLS).
286

293 I suggest that all Man's actions are directly or indirectly related
294 to his natural instincts. Maslo's hierarchy of needs states these
295 instincts nicely in five parts: (1) The need to eat, sleep, breath,
296 etc. (2) The need for shelter/security. (3) The need to love and be
297 loved. (4) The need to achieve acomplishments, and recieve
298 recognition. (5) The need to learn and explore. Society has not in
299 essence changed these, they are still valid in our everyday living.
300 We need to eat and have shelter, so within societies structure we
301 hunt food with money instead of teeth, substituting hunting skills
302 for skills used to aquire money. The love we feel is a chemical
303 brain stimuli used to hasten reproductive instincts, we "love"
304 becuase nature/instinct tells us it's time to reproduce, and sexual
305 peaks arrive in the bearer at the time most healthy for procreation
306 to occur, early-late teens for males due to the growth hormones
307 being still strong and capable of endless sperm prodution, and late
308 womanhood for the fully grown womb and milk prodution capabilities.
309 But it is at achievments and knowledge where this query of yours is
310 directed, so my thesis is thus: Humans, like animals, are stupid.
311 They require a leader and are all simultaneously striving to become
312 this leader. They don't listen to nature, because they feel they
313 have become capable of mastering it completely, so spurn Ideas of
314 physical perfection (the strongest stallion) as a pack leader, yet
315 can't seem to take seriously the idea of a mental giant controling
316 them or they fear/resent the intelligence they are not capable of.
317 They thus stay devided with only small bands of scientists going on
318 to evolve thier brains, and small groups of bodybuilders pursuing
319 physical evolution, going actually nowhere in an unchanging world.
320 There needs to be significant environmental demands to force us
321 into evolution. This leader will be a mutant. As are all true
322 leaders... This will be the first strain of new humans brought
323 about by drastic changes in the environment. Reproduction will
324 occur and this mutation will spread to all others untill the entire
325 population is capable of survival in their new surroundings. Nope.
326 Never mind all this is just flowing out from my mind without any
327 preconception and is going to be read as a jumble of meaningless
328 ponderings. I can't explain why man is different from animals, but
329 I see similarities. We are all evolving at our own rates, so could
330 in time achieve the same as each other, were it not stifled by our
331 dominance of nature through tools, adapting our environment to us
332 instead of ourselves to it, and in the process wiping out species,
333 destroying habitats at unatural rates, giving them no time to 
334 assimilate and correct their genetics to mutate. We are pulling
335 down nature with our manmade tools. I wish we could have evolved
336 differently, but we are here now, trying vainly to repair what we
337 have done, and many of us denying the problem entirely. Ah well.

374    Um, OK, here's my .02 cents (plus a dime for inflation adjustment):
375  
376    1.  Man can NOT adapt to different environments very well.  I would
377 surely drown underwater, or freeze/suffocate in space.  This is why
378 mankind has chosen to alter the environment.  It is people's hubris and
379 neglect and apathy that has brought the environment to its knees.  After
380 all, ANY living creature will alter the environment; the environment is
381 a dynamic, rather than static, setting.  The Earth could easily support
382 a little under a billion people without drastically impacting the
383 ecosystem.  Instead of using information to help ourselves, we, as
384 people, still continue to control the spread of information.  Thus,
385 we still have countries with 5-9 childred per family.  At this rate,
386 the shear numbers of people will be our own downfall.
387  
388    This is why I support Zero Population Growth.
389  
390    2.  Don't feel bad about your relationship, Aaron.  Speaking as
391 a married young man, I can tell you that no matter who you're with,
392 it'll never be easy.  (I personally think that this is why Romance
393 Novels sell so well- because people want to believe that it is
394 very easy to be in love)  It seems that she is unsure about what she
395 wants to begin with (re-read your own message and see if you can
396 spot the contradiction), so don't stress.  Women outnumber men by
397 about a 45:55 ratio, and y're bound to find someone if you keep
398 trying.  Our society also dumps alot of garbage into both Mens and
399 Womens minds.  By the time that people are ready to pair-bond,
400 there are so many misconceptions and misunderstandings that there's
401 bound to be some friction.  Now, don't take the ramblings of this
402 young fool (me) to heart; it just seems that a)you're forming an
403 obsession with her, instead of going through the first state
404 of friendship-building, and b)she seems to either not care about
405 her situation/self/you or she lacks drive/direction/understanding.
406 I'm not trying to criticize you; just relax, sit down, and reflect
407 about how you would feel if some strange woman suddenly developed
408 a STRONG liking to you, but you didn't know what to do with her...
409 
410    Hopefully, you'll gain insite into both your actions and hers.  Is
411 she communicating with you?  This is a big one - it's why my marriage is
412 so rocky with my wife, she doesn't always like to talk to me.  I've
413 had to re-learn how to communicate with her and to be
414 patient with her decisions.  We're doing pretty good now, but that
415 doesn't mean that I can just "sit down" and not put an effort into it...
416 anyway, try keeping your mouth closed when hers is open, and listen
417 carefully to what she says.  When she decides to stop talking, THEN
418 approach her and find out how she feels about you.  If she does the
419 following, then you know what's up:
420  
421    a) acknowledges your intentions and immediately replies.  This means
422 that she has SOME kind of interest in you, even if it was a "no" answer
423 she is at least respecting you as a person, you should feel honored by
424 her effort and respect whatever she says.
425  
426    b) acknowledges you but not your intentions; that is, she's
427 beating around the bush and doesn't answer your questions.  It's eithr
428 a uncomfortable subject for her (in which case I suggest changing the
429 subject IMMEDIATELY) or if she seems vague in her answer then she's
430 unsure about her own decisions (which means, cool your heals and let
431 her have time/space to think - but don't wait forever, you could die
432 waiting for an answer from some peope)
433  
434    c) does not acknowledge you or tries to avoid your presence in 
435 person; this one is fairly obvious to anyone, don't need to explain
436 rejection...
437  
438    d) does not acknowledge you verbally but instead takes some kind of
439 direct action OR becomes verbally aggressive (telling you that "we" need
440 to do this or that, or dictating);  This is evidence of denial.  The
441 denial could be something simple (she's fighting with herself because
442 she doesn't want to have a relationship BUT she also likes you) or vert
443 very very complex (childhood or adolecent scar caused by some trauma,
444 needs professional therapy to help the scar heal enough to be comfortable
445 with herself).  In any event, she will be taking this alternative action
446 instead of giving you acknowledgement because it's a form of a 
447 defense mechanism.  By not confronting her delima, she can remain
448 comfortable with herself, but she will fail to grow as a person until
449 she accepts the fact that there are some things she can't run away from.
450 Hence, her "action" will "defend" her "view" of herself, and she
451 remains "happy".
452  
453    e) does acknowledge you but in an immature way;
454 she might need to grow before she can reach a level of relationship
455 that you are both comfortable with.  Treat her like any other adult,
456 and try not to "judge" or "tell" her anything - it will make her
457 resentful and she will feel like she's constrained by you.
458  
459    Geez, I guess I got a little carried away there... take this
460 with a grain of salt, don't be so hard on yourself, and remember that
461 I'm not attacking you or her in this, I'm just giving my extremely
462 biased personal opinion.

490    Aaron, it's good to hear that you have made your decision about
491 your past situation.  It's also good to hear that I didn't manage
492 to give you some crummy advice - sometimes, taking the advice of
493 another person about your own relationship is the worst thing to do.
494 I'm just happy it worked out for you.  Also, *DO* concentrate on the
495 friendship part (that you mentioned); I think you will find that
496 when "the time" comes as to wheather or not you would be comfortable
497 in a relationship with the other person (and vis. versa for the 
498 said person), you and her will find that it'll be somewhat easier
499 and less "uptight", 'cause you'll both "know each other" already,
500 i.e. no need to hide things from each other.  Good luck on
501 your pursuit of happiness...and don't be afraid of anything...and
502 last of all, never forget to be yourself.
503

607 if it had every other page plastered with a semi-nude model selling cheap-

610    Ban advertising.  If you wanted to know about something, you would
611 be willing to get up and go out to find it.  Advertising plagues our minds,
612 saps our spirits, and cools our hearts away from those we love.  Advertising
613 is the plague of the Information Age.  We need to formulate some kind
614 of "vaccine", something that would selectively remove advertising fro
615 everything we see, hear, and sense.

774 our intangible friend, conscienceness?  Or are we apart from
775 our perceptions?  If I am like others, then I am the same.
776 But I am also different from others, so I am apart.  Which

794 can become a part of your soul.  For whatever reason, Backwater qualifies as

805 Many have lamented the passing their years, And I must confess that I am no
806 better than they.  It seems to me that when I look about, all I see is a 
807 world that I am slowly failing to understand.  It is the young who play 
808 the game of fashion and fads the most ardently.  Perhaps because it is new
809 and fresh to them, while we have grown weary of it.  Of course, the older
810 generation inevitably holds the power, and thus for all their posing and 
811 playing they have in fact very little.

843 Hello world.  I'm new here and I like what I see.  Have you heard of the
844 melibdemaboral sesp?  I happen to have connections with a very prestigios 
845 (really prestigiouuus) physicist who has made a fantastic breakthough in 
846 unification field theory.  Dr. Bodough Ilgner of the Int'l Physics Asylum 
847 will soon become famous due to this incredible discover.  Time travel (of
848 a sort) has become possible throught the utilization of Dr. Ilgner's 
849 discovery, The Melibdemaboral Sesp.  In brief, the sesp works on the 
850 following principle:  objects immersed in the sesp experience a slowing in 
851 the passing of time, providing a  longer pathway into the future.  In layman's
852 terms, an hour becomes approx. 62.34 sec. and a month would become 32.2 days
853 for the object in the sesp.  Although applications for the sesp have yet
854 to be concieved, it is clearly a neat thing.  Says Dr. Ilgner, "it allows
855 one to sneek up on the past from behind!" 
856 
857 Ok, so that's all nonsense.  But I NEED diversions like this.  Cruel world!
858 Catch me in a more poetic mood sometime, and remember, I'm generally 
859 considered an overly serious individual.
