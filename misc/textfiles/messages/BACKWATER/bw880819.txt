 32 FOR NOTHING WE RAN. AGAINST THE WIND, THE RAIN AND THE STEAM OF THE MASSIVE
 33 machine. It was foolish to run, but it was foolish to be alive in an age of
 34 iron hearts and steel fists. The machine towered into the storm clouds above
 35 our heads, and dug into the earth beneath our run. Looming overhead was the
 36 steam from the pipes, the grimy faces of the ones who still slaved for the
 37 machine, and our destiny in the maw of the machine.
 38 	The rain was pouring down the steel path before us. Our feet were awash in
 39 water and steel. I was the first to lose my footing. I almost fell, but saved
 40 myself by running faster and faster until I was on my feet again.
 41 	So when the girl fell onto her chest and slid along, it took me two or
 42 three seconds to go back for her. I faced the way we came. I saw the halftrack
 43 rolling closer and closer under full steam. Panic set in. I grabbed the girl's
 44 hand and pulled as hard as I could. She was not getting up. I was dragging her
 45 through the pools of water on the path. Then, I looked up. It was here. Here.
 46 	Finally.

271  
272                PROJECT GALILEO SHUTTLE TO CARRY LETHAL PLUTONIUM
273  
274           Despite scientific warnings of a possible disaster, NASA is
275      pursuing plans to launch the Project Galileo shuttle space probe which
276      will carry enough plutonium to kill every person on earth.
277           Theoretically, one pound of polutonium, uniformly distributed,
278      has the potential to give everyone on the planet a fatal case of lung
279      cancer.  Galileo will have 49.25 pounds of plutonium on board, most of
280      it plutonium 238, a radioisotope 300 times more radioactive than the
281      one used as fuel for atomic bombs.
282           Critics of the plan, such as Dr. John Gofman, professor of
283      medical physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and Michio
284      Kaku, professor of nuclear physics at the City University of New York
285      claim that putting Galileo's plutonium payload into space is both
286      risky and unnecessary.
287           The plutonium will be used to fuel "radioisotope thermoelectric
288      generators" which keep instrumentation warm.  Although NASA and the
289      DOE say there are no alternatives, professor Kaku asserts that the
290      latest advances in solar cells make it possible to generate solar
291      electricity even as far away as Jupiter, Galileo's destination.
292           NASA downplays the possibility of the release of plutonim in an
293      accident, stressing that the substance will be encapsulated in "clads"
294      made from iridium alloy in a graphite shell.  The DOE contends that
295      clads can withstand explosive pressures up to 2,200 pounds per square
296      inch.  However, a DOE safety analysis report on the Galileo mission
297      obtained under FOIA states that from the viewpoint of potential
298      nuclear fuel release, the most critical accidents would occur on the
299      launch pad.  Launch pad accident scenarios, such as "tipovers" and
300      "pushovers" are estimated to generate explosive pressures as high as
301      19,600 psi.
302           Once in space, Galileo is still potentially danglerous.  Since
303      the solid-fuel rocket substituted for the highly volatile liquid-fuel
304      Centaur rocket used in the Challenger does not have the power of the
305      Centaur, NASA devised a plan to use the earth's gravitational pull to
306      increase the rocket's momentum sufficiently to reach Jupiter.  During
307      the "flyby" orbits around the earth, Galileo would at times be only
308      277 miles overhead.  A 1987 NASA report estimates the chance of
309      Galileo inadvertently reentering the earth's atmosphere to be less
310      than one in a million, and, as such, an accident scenario is deemed
311      not credible.
312           NASA set the probability figures for the chance of a shuttle
313      accident at one in 100,000 for thhe Challenger. Investigation 
314      following the crash put the figure at closer to one in 25.
315           While "The Lethal Shuttle: Plutonium Payload Scheduled" was one
316      of the top 10 overlooked stories cited by Project Censored in 1986,
317      the continued failure of the media to draw attention to the potential
318      risk of Project Galileo fully warrants its renomination for 1987.

354  
355    The Tower loomed in the distence, seemingly forgotted.  Large birds
356 flew overhead, hundreds circling the tower for prey.  As dark as the
357 surroundings were at that place, one could make out things that
358 slithered and oozed along the walls.  Every now and then a bird would
359 swoop down and sieze one of the creatures on the walls, and fly off as
360 the thing would struggle and spurt blood into the air, making
361 horrid screams.  The tower itself was in a state of decay, with
362 some sections covered in filth and overgrowth, others with holes
363 where previous adventurerers had fought and lost against the
364 inhabitents.  Large burnmarks and places where the wall was
365 cracked or partly missing could be seen at this distence;
366 such was the size of the place.  It drew energy towards itself
367 at a mind-boggling rate, which would explain for the clouded appearence
368 around it on a sunny day.  Even the motion of the circling birds
369 overhead gave some energy, as the poor beasts tryed to stay aloft
370 from the gravitational pull.
371  
372    Then I 'felt' it.
373  
374    He was in a serious condition.  I gave him an energy tap to keep
375 the Orb from drawing all of his existence away from him.
376  
377    John and the Brownie were up, and nearly going at it again.
378  
379    Kurfur was fully awake, and from the look of his Eyes, I could
380 tell what he wanted.  The way he stared at the tower, with
381 no mercy, no pity.  He wanted more than revenge.  He wanted
382 his pride.  He would not be denied a warrior's fate.  And a warrior's
383 life; only when the Dark Ones were slain, pacified, or neutralized
384 would he rest or eat.  And even then, the scar would still be
385 barely visible.
386  
387    The energy tap I made was becoming tight; I widened the stream
388 as the Orb continued its drain.  I had to get him to the tower,
389 into the heart of the tower.  There, he would find the Orb, but
390 he would only be able to recover it at great risk to his
391 life, for in the holding chamber, there were many traps and
392 creatures I dare not describe, and things that would
393 haunt my mind in my dreams for years to come.  And, for every
394 person that failed, their carcus would be either strewn on the
395 floor from where the bones were regurgitated, or where a trap
396 had ripped or poked or crushed or cut the life out of their frail
397 bodies.
398  
399    John had to be stable throughout all of this; if he should
400 become unglued from the horrors in this, his fear could have
401 a drastic effect on the time flow of the tower.  And, life forbid,
402 if he should lose his sanity, I could not figure if it would
403 react to the strange powers in that vile place.  The dimension might
404 even cease to exist, as the interaction of energies would snuff out
405 all of our existences in the twinkling of an eye.
406  
407    And that was only the beginning.
408  
409    Between the energy tap, the interaction of my existence and the
410 strange energies of this place, John's mental stability (which I
411 would probably need to stablize through thought transference),
412 and keeping Kurfur alert after X number of beserkergangs, my hands
413 would basically be tied.  In short, an easy target for the Dark Ones.
414  
415    I remembered:
416  
417    "If you should fail, pick up the pieces and make the most of it."
418  
419    If I failed, I would have to literally give my life to every
420 person present.  It would insure their safe return to the Inn,
421 when this was over.
422  
423     I just realized I was whistling while I was p*ssing.  I
424 concentrated ahead to see if the creatures were lying in ambush;
425 I found that they were in the tower.  Along with everyone and everything.
426  
427    I took a breath, uttered a short mantra for a minute in meditation,
428 and then opened the Eye.
429  
430    I smiled.  I knew.  I could not tell the others, but it
431 would be alright.  I could tell them afterwards.  I closed the Eye.
432  
433    "Let's go."  I hovered towards the tower at about a walking speed.

442   We stopped some distance away from the Citadel of the Lords of Darkness, 
443 which looked as horrible and decrepit as the rest of its surroundings, 
444 all around the tower there were blast marks, whole areas of grass burned
445 away leaving barren, scorched earth where green meadows once were, from 
446 magic blasts and fires from previous battles fought, and lost, against the
447 evil ones. It was still night, so we weren't noticed by any of the guards
448 as of yet. The Wanderer was lighting the way for us against the darkness 
449 with a magic spell that he knew. We could still see much against the sky
450 though, and it was becoming lighter, annoucing the beginning of a new day,
451 which would hopefully see the end of the Lords of Darkness.
452   The Wanderer spoke the dissolve magic spell spell, and just after that
453 the first light of the sun peeked from behind the Citadel, though it soon
454 be came lost in the dismal mist surrounding the tower and covering the sky.
455   The Guru signaled us to begin our advance on the tower and began by 
456 moving ahead at a nice walking speed. I moved up behind the Guru and asked
457 him, "If it isn't night how can we get by the guards without being seen?"
458   "I have altered the light waves that we reflect, bending them so the 
459 guards see only the familiar, though sickening, field and forest that they
460 are so used to. Just as light waves can be bent, so can sound waves.", he
461 said alknowing.
462    "I see...", and I fell into step beside him.
463    Kurfur had hatred and malice in his eyes as he walked on the other side
464  of the Guru, wanting to destroy the Lords of Darkness to the last man. 
465  The Wanderer and his ever hungry for power Orb was just behind Kurfur and
466 to his left. Johnny Edison Interdemensional Polic Officer was just behind
467 me carrying the tub which, at the push of a button, had transformed into a
468 small cube in his right hand, and next to him the Brownie was walking, for
469 the first time there was a silence between them as they gazed at the tower
470 with apprehension. 
471    We approached the moat whose drawbridge was up and in the water were
472 a altered breed of Phiranah fish who were always hungry and attacked in
473 milliseconds - leaving bones in the water where that person fell in. The
474 Guru moved towards me and inquired, "Do you know a spell that can make
475 a bridge? Or something similar?", he said.
476    I turned to him and replied, "No, but I do know a spell that makes wood
477 timbers, which can be used to make a bridge."
478    "I can alter the structure and arrangement of things, but not make 
479 things with my power. I will make a bridge from your wood boards", he said
480 sounding relived that he had found a way across.

481    I then thought of something and became very worried and asked the Guru,
482 "How are you going to shield the bridge from the guards sight and sound 
483 also, while you are shielding us?"
484    "That is a problem", he said and thought for a moment,"Kurfur, could 
485 you incapacitate those two guards on this side of the tower...And make it
486 quiet and quick."
487    Kufur moved over to the guard on the far right and hit him on the back
488 of the head when the other guard was lookig in the other direction. He 
489 moved speedily over to the second sentenial and completed his job most
490 effeciently.
491    I brought up the spell and said, "Kanee Rheenar Morook", which caused
492 many wooden, cut boards to appear on the near bank of the moat. The Guru
493 motioned his hand causing them to conform into a make-shift bridge.
494    We moved across the bridge and onto the side of the Citadel. I stopped
495 and said a destroy my own spells work spell, which caused the wood to 
496 vanish to be called up when we were ready to leave. I went over to the
497 group which was standing next to the closed drawbridge. The Guru then
498 said, "I will change your molecular densities causing you and all of your
499 posessions to be able to move through this drawbridge, but still be able
500 to move by my mental propulsion", and as he was saying this, we suddenly
501 saw the surroundings as very small and minute, due to the fact that our
502 eyes also changed in density, and moved forward through the tiny
503 drawbridge and porticulous.
504    When we passed through the entryway we returned to normal size, inside
505 the Citadel of the Lords of Darkness.

510 Well, now I see wht those stories were "censored". If quality of the reporting 
511 in the other stories is of the same level as that in the one about the
512 plutonium inthe Galileo probe, then they aren't news stories! Rather, they are 
513 *poorly written* propaganda!
514  
515 First of all, the plutonium *even if it escaped* would *not* be evenly 
516 distributed. Speculating on the effects if it was evenly distributed is like
517 speculating on the effects on world climate if rainfall is evenly distributed!
518  
519 Second, The fact that the isotope is more radioactive than that used in bombs
520 is another red herring. The isotopes used in nuclear weapons, aren't all that
521 radioactive. Heck, the radioisotopes in your *smoke alarm* are more radioactive
522 than the stuff in this probe! (yes, Virginia, there are radio-isotopes in your
523 smoke detector. It won't work without them!) (btw, there's a lot more than 40 
524 pounds of such isotopes out there in consumer products like smoke detectors,
525 and they are a *lot* more likely to be released) 
526  
527 As for the hazards, the type of generators used on missions like Galileo have
528 been tested in real explosions! (a few of them in accidents). One such unit
529 was in a satellite whose booster exploded. They recovered the generator 
530 *intact* from the Atlantic, and put it in the replacement satellite when they
531 launched it. 
532  
533 There was one on the LM on Appollo 13. In case you've forgotten, the LM re-
534 entered at speeds similar to those that Galileo would be at during those
535 near Earth gravity slingshots. The LM burned up. They never found the
536 generator, but careful monitoring showed no trace of the plutonium so it *must*
537 may landed intact. (It would be on the abyssal plain in mid-Pacific if you
538 care to look for it). 
539  
540 This whole story is based on the paranoia surrounding the word "plutonium".

558                     U.S. SENDS BULLETS TO STARVING CHILDREN
559  
560           Between 1979 and 1985, U.S. military and economic aid to Honduras
561      jumped from $31 to $282 million yearly. The largest increase was in
562      military aid which jumped to 28 times the 1979 level. In exchange,
563      Honduras agreed to become a base for some 15,000 Nicaraguan "contras,"
564      to join the U.S. military in joint maneuvers, and to provide
565      logistical and intelligence support to the Salvadoran military in its
566      war against the guerrillas.
567           During the same time period, U.S. aid designated for development
568      assistance dropped from 80 percent to six percent.
569           To make matters even worse, floods washed away 60 percent of the
570      corn crop in southern Honduras in May 1986.  A severe summer drought
571      followed the flood, destroying all that remained of the corn and
572      wiping out 60 percent of the area's sorghum.
573           Bishop Raul Corriveau, the archbishop of Choluteca, said,
574      "We've seen scenes of misery like never before. Children with swollen
575      bellies, old people looking like corpses, women and children begging
576      for food, men roaming the streets searching for work."
577           Due to airstrips and bases built by the U.S. and the presence of
578      contras and American troops (80,000 troops in 1987), Hondurans living
579      in the southern region and along the eastern border have been
580      displaced.  The livelihoods of 2,000 Honduran coffee growers have been
581      destroyed and 16,000 Hondurans have been forced to leave their homes.
582           Orphanages and temporary shelters have been filled with "economic
583      orphans" -- children who have been abandoned by parents who can no
584      longer afford to raise them ... parents who have seen their coffee
585      bean fields turned into battlefields.
586           It has been estimated that 70 percent of the children are
587      malnourished. Among those brought to the capital's hospital for
588      treatment, 10 to 15 percent die due to a lack of vitamins.
589           Dr. Juan Almendares, a physician conducting research on
590      malnutrition at the National University in Tegucigalpa, "When the
591      government says there is no money available to help the hungry, we
592      must remember that Honduras receives more than $200 million a year
593      from the U.S. government. We Hondurans ask why isn't any of this money
594      going to help the poor?"
595           Ann M. Kelly, editor of FOOD FIRST NEWS, a quarterly published by
596      the Institute for Food and Development Policy, wrote the following
597      lead to Medea Benjamin's article about the Honduran situation:
598           "While working on a new Food First book in Honduras, Medea
599      Benjamin -- Food First's Central American analyst -- uncovered a food
600      crisis of frightening proportions in the southern part of the country.
601      We alerted national media in the United States but the story went
602      uncovered."

633           DECLINE IN GENETIC DIVERSITY: GLOBAL DISASTER IN THE MAKING
634  
635           Diversity in the gene pool is shrinking at an alarming rate and
636      could lead to what Robert Cowen, science editor of the CHRISTIAN
637      SCIENCE MONITOR, says "could become a mass extinction of Earth's plant
638      and animal species." Species extinction of both plants and animals has
639      accelerated rapidly in the 20th century and has reached what many feel
640      is a state of crisis. From 1600 to 1900, one species disappeared every
641      four years; now perhaps 1,000 species become extinct each year. The
642      Worldwatch Institute pamphlet on conserving the diversity of life,
643      published in June 1987, predicts the extinction rate in 20 years will
644      reach more than 100 species per day.
645           The loss of life forms is more than an aesthetic issue.  The
646      rapid extinction of food crop germplasm represents a disaster in the
647      making.  Unless the trend is slowed, mass famine on a global scale is
648      a real possibility.  The International Board for Plant Genetic
649      Resources has issued warnings that the genetic diversity of many of
650      the staple crops that feed the world such as wheat, rice, barley,
651      millet, and sorghum is imperiled.  72% of the U.S. potato crop is
652      concentrated in four genetic strains.  Six varieties account for 71%
653      of the corn crop.  Of the cataloged vegetables grown in the U.S. in
654      1901/02, less than four percent still existed in 1985.
655           Genetic diversity is a prerequisite for agricultural success.
656      Genetic uniformity makes crops vulnerable to environmental threats
657      such as pests, blight, and drought.  The Irish potato famine was the
658      result of genetic uniformity. The U.S. lost 75% of its durum wheat
659      crop in 1953/54 and 50% of its corn crop in 1970, both due to genetic
660      uniformity.
661           The dimunition of diversity has led to what some researchers call
662      the global "seed wars."  As plant species disappear around the world,
663      "access to, control over and preservation of plant genetic resources
664      becomes a matter of international concern and conflict." The vast
665      majority of the world's genetic resources is concentrated in the Third
666      World. In order to prevent crop stains from inbreeding, the industrial
667      nations resort to "germplasm appropriation," a strategy for collecting
668      plant genetic material from Third World countries. The fact that the
669      "collection" is done without recompense further exacerbates tensions
670      between industrial and developing nations.
671           The Plant Variety Protection Act legislation of 1970, which
672      broadened the interpretation of U.S. patent laws to allow corporations
673      to patent seed varieties, has accelerated the extinction rate of food
674      crop germplasm.  Germplasm appropriated from the Third World is sold
675      back to developing countries in the form of hybridized, patented seed.
676      Farmers in the world's centers of diversity are planting genetically
677      uniform crops more and more frequently, thus causing further loss of
678      indigenous seed.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
679      estimates that two thirds of all Third World crops will be from
680      uniform strains by the year 2000.
681           The disappearance of genetic diversity either by accident or
682      design is a critical issue that has had little media coverage or
683      public debate. Germplasm has not made headlines.  There are no "Save
684      the Barley" bumperstickers. Yet every day, more and more of our
685      precious food sources disappear forever.

740    Many Eons ago (that's 4 disks to you and me) I wrote a 500 line
741 story abut q man, a suit, and his world.  It was called EnvironSuit
742 and was written to accomodate the man's point of view.  It was not
743 one of the better stories I've done in my life, but most people agreed
744 that it was marginally entertaining...

754 J.D.'s Place is down. The modem has apparently gone belly up and nobody has
755 connected with the board sinse Mydnight on the 26th.
756  
757 Whether this has anything to do with recent line noise complaints has yet to be
758 seen. I will take it in to IB Computers tomorrow to see what's wrong and if it
759 can be fixed. There is a chance  will be able to brrow a modem for the interim

916 One day I was watching the late night movie on channel 12 when suddenly my 
917  
918 tongue started growing.  It looked pretty sick.  It was getting longer and
919 longer by the hour then it was crawling on the0floob, which tasted pretty
920 awful then it wrapped around the house a couple of times before it went out
921 in the street.  A big large semi truck was heading full speed right towards
922 my tongue.  I freaked!  I could not do anything about the siteqtio~.  So the
923 truck was moving faster and faster and faster.  OUCH OUCH OUCH!!!! I screamed
924 as the tire rolled over my slobbeering tongue.  Blood everywhere. It was a 
925 disgusting and unforgetable sight.  So now I cannot talk anymore.  I loct my
926 tongue in surgery.  The doctors tried to tie it in a big fat not.  But it
927 didn't work so finally they had to ?(this is sick) chop it off with a big ugly
928 chainsaw that was in grandma's kitchen.  Eventually I began to say words again
929 with what little tongue I had left.  This is basically the end of this awful
930 and totaly fake story.  Thanx for listening.  Comments are not nessicary(excuse
