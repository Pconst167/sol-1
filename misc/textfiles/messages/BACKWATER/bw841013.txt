25 	Mike,
26    Backwater is a good board, what is it run on?  I have lately
27  been trying to simulate this board on a Apple but there has been no
28  luck yet.  Did you write this for yourself or got it from a friend or
29  was it bought?  Finding another system like this one has been on the
30   tough side.

35  Cistop Mikey; Please don't get too frustrat, we aren't all like that. In fact most of us aren't at all.
36   [This enter only stuff isn't great for the complexion of my messages...]
37   I appreciate what you do for Backwater, and I thank you very, very much for it. It has done wonders for my maturity [I *am*
38 an adolescent after all]
39   My thanks to you. If I can help in any way please don't hesitate to ask.
40   Leonard; Please explain what you meant in more detail, please?
41   To whom that asked; MLCBBS should be up in about a week or so from what I've heard I go to MLC anyway.
42 [Error; exchange carriage return and periond for comma] and will post updates every few days, or so.

52 Hi all,
53 	Why do we help other poeple, even when it puts us in danger?  Why do
54 we give money, when we know we will never get it back?  Are we as selfish
55 as the cynical cartoonists and editors (A random sampling of cynical sterotypes)
56 would have us to believe?  Is there still good left in this world?
57 	Of course there is good in the world, otherwise, who would run all the
58 BBS's?  Putting up with the rampaging deleters can be a problem, but this
59 enter only mode seems to spoil their fun (Maybe they will go someplace else,
60 or get their own to mess up.)  
61 	A lot of people start out playing Good Sam, hoping to receive the same
62 the same treatment one day.  But then, they get into a strange habit,
63 they start doing helpful things without thinking of future rewards.
64 The gratitude of the people they help seems to be enough to satisfy them.
65 	Just go out and do something nice, it may happen to you....

81 Mark:Pascal has one thing over basic, decent file handler routines. It woould take a few days on intense work to do it in 
82 basic. The phone number isn/t even known to me yet, I have no idea of when it will be up for public use, it must be twit-
83 proof berefore it goes online.
84 Mikey:I am afraid that I am u~able to understand your reference to Nerdolux, mayhaps you could explane? or tell Aaron?
85 The reason that H would bother to put up a BW type system is that I *ENJOY* seeing people use there minds. I am one of those
86 few folks who get off on creating things and helping people.My only sugestion is that you use the board that I am currently
87 building to replace the one that BW normaly uses. It hooks up to a modem, 2 sa400's and a power supply. Hang in txere, anti-tw

105 The Poet noticed, as he monitored some of the more distant realities, that several people had taken the Magic 
106 Words he had given them (top of drive B) to enter a very confusing but satisfying otherworld. One had even left
107 an addition to the cast of characters assembling there... someone named Chimp or Gibbon or something like that.
108 He smiled at the thought of his Backwater friends having someplace to go when they couldn't get into the Inn,
109 and sipped his last ale of the evening. Life was good. Maybe a quick check of that adventure his friends were on...
110 He gazed into his pocket just in time to see the flying horse he'd seen earlier disappearing into the maw of some
111 huge reality-nexus. Too late, he noticed the regular ripples marching across the Gate's face, ripples that could
112 only be the residual effects of his earlier tampering with reality... waves of shimmering green energy exploded
113 from his pocket, engulfing him. By the time the Innkeeper turned back to ask him to take care of his tab, he was
114 gone. Shrugging, the Innkeeper simply filed it away, without a thought of how he'd left without notice.

120    Many things in this world are addictive.  We come to love our dependencies
121 on automobiles, creature comforts, music, adventure and other pleasurable
122 things.  We can grow to despise ourselves due to dependencies on drugs --
123 alcohol, tobacco, the vast street pharmacopia -- and for some the visceral
124 thrill of combat or the exhilaration of power that comes from taking a life.
125   Others seem positivley -- how can I phrase it? -- anti-addictive.  Their minds
126 and bodies reject some of the addictive portions of our lives -- violently
127 reject in mindless spasms of agony -- reject as thouroughly as the piper was
128 rejecting the throat-burning remains of his breakfast.  
129   As soon as the adrenaline push, put their by peril, faded, the piper began
130 to reflect on recent happenings.  Over the past few weeks he had slipped out
131 of the Inn and befriended the pegasus in a quiet forest glade.  He had felt no
132 sense of peril when, fascinated by the incredible beauty of this magnificent
133 beast, he had walked up to press his bearded face agains the silky warmth of
134 her white neck.  Oblivious of peril, blinded by a wild, obsessive love, he
135 had spoken his hear to her as he came towards her in that clearing.  He had not
136 noticed the tensing of the great flying muscles under the satin softness of 
137 her coat -- he was lost in the deep pools of her eyes, caught in the 
138 wind-whipped fabric of her mane.  Only much later did he realize the mortal
139 danger he had faced that day.  He had come to the clearing just to be near her,
140 and she had come out of the sky to meet him.  A sudden gust, and she was 
141 flung too near a tree, nearly a foot in diameter, over fifty feet tall.  Heart
142 beating wildly, the piper waited with that strange sense of loss for her to 
143 crash into that tree, the rending, breaking of beloved flesh into shapelessness
144 and death.                            It seemed to happen in slow motion.                                            
145 His eyes caught every nuance.                        She turned sideways -- perhaps she would only
146 break a wing.                                     Only break a wing!  How do you set a pegasus' wing?                  
147 Suddenly, quick as thought, her wing snapped forward, propelled by the power
148 of the muscles that gave her the freedom of the skies.  The wing was half
149 folded, and she struck the tree just inside the large main joint.  The softly
150 feathered leading edge of her wing snapped through the bole of the tree, 
151 pulling the base along with her.  She had flown clear of the area and landed 
152 before the tree had fallen and stopped quivering.  He inspected it after she
153 left -- while she was there, he had no though of anything but her presence.
154 Her coat was unruffled, and the most minute inspection of the wing revealed 
155 only a few drops of pitch that he carefully removed, but the tree she had 
156 felled left a stump over six feet high, and the piper could not span the 
157 splintered end with his hand.  
158   These images -- the splintered tree, the graceful curve of her neck -- 
159 dissolved into the terrible image of her wing striking into the face of the
160 ambusher.  He reched helplessly, bent over a rock, as he remembered the
161 startled expression on --- the quick look of amazement and disbelief --- the
162 impact of the wing--- his fierce
163 joy as the being's head seemed to nearly explode in slow motion -- the agony
164 that showed in the eyes as they parted -- NO!                                   NO! 
165 
166 
167 
168 He placed his arms about the pegasus' warm neck, buried his face in her mane,
169 and wept his heart out as she nickered and tried to comfort him.

175         Hello, do you rember when you suggested a 'C' book for me? Well i still havent found it, however
176  ve   a new toy(so to speek). You see one day i was wandering arround PCC. not realy doing aneything and suddenly
177  a rather tall man ran up to me and said(Allmost yelled more like)" Do you want PASCALL?", i said sure so hear i 
178 
179  am, plagued(sp) with this coppy of pascal. So, what was this message about?. Oh ya now i rember(i have problems 
180  on sundays i tend to get a bit long winded ans (did your screen just do something? mine did)oh well, to make a 
181  long story even longer. do you know of aney good pascal books?

198 PASDOS is a utility program written in Pascal and assembly for the Apple II
199        computer to allow transfers of files between Dos 3.3 and U.C.S.D
200        Pascal. 
201        Pasdos will run under both the old and new versions of Apple Pascal.
202        
203        Using this program one is able to
204        
205        1..View a Pascal directory or a Dos 3.3 catalog.
206           A single keystroke command determines and displays
207           the proper directory (Pascal or Dos) from the drive
208           selected.
209        
210        2..Transfer text files in both directions with automatic conversion.
211           Text files from Dos 3.3 are made compatible with the U.C.S.D.
212           editor and Pascal compiler. Text files generated with the
213           Pascal editor are made compatible with many word proccessors
214           that run under Dos 3.3.
215        
216        3..Transfer other files with optional addition or removal of the
217           Dos 3.3 length and starting address header.
218        
219        4..Use the U.C.S.D. Assembler to generate binary files that
220           can be 'brun' under Dos 3.3.
221        
222        5..Demonstrations are included to show you how to transfer and
223           load hires picture files, and how to use the U.C.S.D 
224           assembler to create binary programs that will run under
225           Dos 3.3.
226        
227        6..Various data base programs are written under Dos 3.3 or Pascal.
228           With Pasdos you can transfer hires graphs to your favorite
229           operating system for printer dumps etc.
230  
231 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
232  
233       Pasdos requires that you have Pascal and Dos 3.3.
234       You must have two floppy drives.
235       
236 
237 I hear rumors that there are some alleged 68000 knowledgable people out there. All though I doubt they really know
238 what they are talking about, I would like to ask them a few questions regarding the MPU they think they know so
239 well. Many unsuspecting or innocent junior level hardware hackers consider the 68000 to be a very regulat
240 processor. Orthagonal (look it up) is the word the quote-unquote experts use. Defenders, not the ones here I
241 imagine, can make excuses for the many irregularities found equating them with the inline philosophy of the
242 original architects. But some of these irregularities go beyond simple design philishophy. I wish to propose
243 entering some of these irregularities here on this board that is so laden with experts, and see what their
244 reponses are. If I get no reponses, then I will know the rumors of expertise I heard were just rumors, and
245 once again some group is having
246 their collective leg pulled by a phony.
247 1) The CMP instruction performs is subtraction in the opposite order from most other machines; the sequence CMP P,Q;
248 BLT LAB branches if Q<P. Why did they do this? Why did they make it different from other machines? How did the
249 architects of the PDP11 solve the same problem.
250 2) The CHK instruction works only on short (16-bit) indices.
251 3) CHK, CLR, TST, and arithmetic shift instructions do not work on address registers, complicating their use as
252 index registers. Why?
253 4) There is no SWAP instruction that swaps the bytes in a word. Why leave this command out? Is there another
254 way to do it?
255 I have many many more little problems that have been discovered about the 68000. I will wait to enter these
256 after I read the responses from the resident experts on one through four here. Explain to me why each of
257 these things were done. Tell me how to get around it? Better yet, tell me a better way to do it, if you can
258 think of one. Prove to me you know what you all are talking about here. Put you mind where your mouth is.
259 Just sign me Skeptical.

261 ********************************************************************::
262 HUH? WHAT'S A 68000? NEVER HEARD OF IT. FOR THAT MATTER, WHAT'S A 'CMP'
263 OR 'BLT' SOUNDS LIKE SOME WIERD CODE TO ME.

280 of my msgs you are asking about.
281 Mikey & other BW rewrite people:
282   I have a couple of 'minor' changes that I'd like feedback on.
283 1. Have the MA return to a 'default' setting after log-off. (No more "who keeps
284 leaving the system in MA 22?!") After all, many of the other parameters return
285 to default values for each session.
286 2. If you are in favor of #1, what value should txe default be? 32? 40? 64? 80?
287 3. I know that SOME of us have GREAT difficulty uploading to BW. Would it help
288 if BW sent an XOFF after the CR/LF pair (in ENter mode) & sent an XON when it 
289 was ready to for the next line? (for those who don't know, XOFF= ctrl S,
290 XON= ctrl Q).
291 4. (Mikey) It was suggested that we go to a "more common" disk format. IBM 
292 360K disks were mentioned. I get a rough figure of 2000 lines /disk! How 
293 about CP/M 8 SSSD? That would be "only" 1200-1300 lines/disk. (I'm assuming
294 128 char records). Unfortunately, ther isn't a 5.25" standard....

297 At last, the party had reached the Gazebo.  It was a rather large structure, all white and open on all sides.  The sun
298 had sunk near the horizon, and the atmosphere of the place was... well, as if the world were awaking and paying 
299 attention to the show about to come.
300 An echo of a large destructive blast made itself heard; the attackers had not given up the chase yet.  Milchar estimated
301 they would arrive in a half-hour: plenty of time to see the sunset and then leave.  Two problems preyed on his mind:  
302 The sudden appearance of a homicidal maniac, and the strange blue water that had appeared to heal them all.  Giving the
303 problems up for now as unsolvable, Milchar directed the party to sit down, and watch.
304 The sun was very low now, almost completely gone...  Far off, a small spark, a tiny glow appeared.  Suddenly, hundreds
305 of its kin appeared, moving, dancing, swaying to some unheard music.  Millions of them were out now, Billions- and still
306 they came.  They began to form thousands and thousands of lines, curves, and other shapes... they stopped... and the
307 map was finished just as the last ray of the sun was consumed by the thirsty outcropping of rock on the horizon.
308 Milchar hurriedly motioned, and spoke a few low words, and the Ruby-creatures glowed for just a brief moment longer .
309 
310 Then it was over, the Ruby-creatures were gone, the show over for tonight.  Slowly, Milchar stood up.  He was panting 
311 softly with the effort of that spell.  Weakly, he said, "Now, what did you all see in the map?  Especially you, Former.
312 Did you see anything that struck a chord somewhere in your being?"
313 Thinking hard, the group was silent for a few minutes.  "I saw a pinnicle of tall rock, perfectly smooth and perfectly
314 made.  I saw a door in it.  I saw that I must attempt that door.", Milchar said.  "Did anyone else see their destiny?"
315 ++++++++++++++
316 "Drat, my most twisted servant, slaughtered by a Pegasi.  I should have known that fool would tell the others to 
317 restrain themselves- he wanted to kill them all by himself.  Now I have to do it alone- or they will discover what they
318 should do.  Damn Hargo!  If you only would have taken them all out, instead of playing with them!  At least you got 
319 that meddling mage...", Narfaal cursed to himself.  "Sorgin, do not fail as he did.  Destroy them, or meet his fate."

325 throttle,  and  watched the numbers tick upwards  on the dash.... 
326 80...  90....  100... Then another turn quickly came up.  A quick 
327 tap  on the brakes to reduce the speed and begin  the  transition 
328 through  the  turn.   Slowly drifting to the outside lane as  the 
329 tires screem their torment.  Inches away from the guardrail,  and 
330 the worst is over,  slowly begin increasing the throttle, pushing 
331 the  car  to the limits of its performance.   Then the  turn  was 
332 behind,   and  he  was  accelerating  to  speed  again.    Almost 
333 immediately another turn loomed ahead,  and again the process was 
334 repeated.  Yet  pushing  himself to the  limit,  requiring  total 
335 concentration,  and the use of all his senses,  still it did  not 
336 help.   Still he could not run away from life and his past.   Try 
337 as he might,  still it intruded upon him.   The turn... going too 
338 fast...  slam  on  the brakes,  got to slow down...  the  painful 
339 squeal of the tires fills the cold moutain air as the car skidded 
340 into the turn.   Try as he might,  he could not slow down enough.  
341 Head for the inside,  try to get as much room as  possible,  hope 
342 the  car  can  make it thru the turn.   Heading for  the  inside,
343 releasing the brakes to gain traction,  dirt and leaves fly  from 
344 beneath the wheels,  and the turn begins.  Drifting too fast, not 
345 going to make it.  Then another car looms ahead. Over reaction... 
346 too late to recover... and the car plunges over the embankment... 
347 tumbling over and over into the bottomless dark black ravine.....  
348      In  a darkened corner of the Inn,  a huddled figure  screems 
349 out in fear, disturbing the few late night customers at the Inn.

353      For a moment he could hardly believe his ears. Snapping his head up
354 from the chart his eyes strained to make sense of the shapes that swirled
355 and faded in the mist. Yes, there was that sound again, that most dreaded of
356 sounds that can assail a captain's ears. Turning his head toward the sound
357 and cupping his hands around his ears served to confirm his worst thoughts.
358 Indeed, it was one of the few things that could strike fear in the heart of
359 a salt-seasoned sea captain, the sound of breaking surf. Just at that moment
360 the swirling mist shifted and thinned to give a clear view to starboard, he
361 almost wished it hadn't. The wall of water rising up, broad on the starboard
362 bow, was taller than the foremast and the top was beginning to bend under
363 its own weight. 'Southwind' was already beginning to climb the face of the
364 wave. During the next few seconds every move would count!

390 The show was over.  I was deeply touched by what I had seen.  "Milchar, I too saw a rock
391 that holds our destiny.  But the rock i saw had no door apparent.  Instead, I observed
392 a deep pit concealed beneath the path one must take to the rock.  I also saw the Rowan tree
393 that was planted in the grove growing swiftly, to guide our souls."  I feared, again, for
394 the safety of our group.
395 "Should we not leave this place now, my friend ?  I fear that our enemies are approaching
396 faster than we had anticipated."  I shouldered the goatskin bota that I had collected the
397 healing water in, and prepared to leave when Milchar wished.
398 In less time than one can tell, a lavender glow appeared in the center of the gazebo.  What
399 new member of our party was appearing, I thought.  Perhaps an inhabitant of this valley,
400 hoping to aid us in our search?

434 BUT WITH THE VARIOUS METHODES OF STORRING DATA ON THE OLD SYSTEM, IT
435 COULDN'T BE DONE THAT WAY.) THE OLD METHODE WAS TO DO A CHECK POINT AFTER
436 EVERY 5 LINES OF ENTRY (IE SAVE CURRENT POSITION) THEN DO A FINAL UPDATE 
437 IF THE OFF COMMAND WAS GIVEN. THE EXIT REALLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING, IT USE
438 TO BE PART OF THE EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS ROUTINES, BUT SINCE BWMS DOESN'T

453 Hi All,
454 	How about a little SF tonite....
455      The player looked around, and gunned his turbines nervously.
456 He softly slipped out the field effect clutch and moved slowly down the
457 dirt track.  The night was black, good hunting.  Hopefully, there would
458 be others out tonight, for he was drasically falling off of his pervious
459 lead.
460 	A movement off to the left!  The player jumped his car forward, and
461 trained his beams on it.  Damm! he thought, only a Shatik, one of annoying
462 animal population.  When he looked again, the hugh hippocephalic creature
463 was gone. (THINKER:  Damm the critics!  Full speed ahead!)  As he turned
464 off his lights, he noticed a light in the blackness.  Prey at last!  The 
465 player had lost the thrill of stalking an unknowing oppenent, but he
466 had to fight or run.  Running never won The Game.
467 	The player crept his car down the road, looking for any signs
468 of life.  He turned right, following the light.  Suddenly, another car
469 roared out of the darkness, passing in front of him.  Getting carless,
470 thought the player, a good driver wouldf had him.  Not spending another
471 thought on remorse, he took off after the other car.
472 	The player followed the car, turning right, left, skidding around
473 unbanked curves, nethier gaining on the other.  The other car turned down
474 another lane, much like the others, 
475 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
476 ... and then the person typing in that intriguing story lost his carrier and didn't finish it.  Too bad, maybe in 
477 another entry...
478 ++++++++++++
479 "A Pit, you say?  Nay, I did not see that, perhaps we all got just a small glimpse of our common goal.  What's that?",
480 Milchar asked, referring to the violet glow that was growing stronger by the second.  A Voice?  "Go... you have your
481 guides now... you have the knowledge.  Redeem thy race from the abhorrence that follows you."
482 Milchar was taken aback.  That couldn't be, not here, a place where even the most minor magics are tremendous efforts to
483 cast... No One had the power to transmit his voice here, in The Center Of All Things... but someone had, someone that
484 wanted their persuers stopped.  Milchar asked the glow, "Who...?"
485 "You shall see."
486 "Why...?"
487 "Is it the place for heroes to ask why they were chosen?"
488 "No, but..."
489 "Would you have gone on this quest anyway, without any side interference?"
490 "Yes, but..."
491 The Voice did not say any more, but silenced the group by slowly dissolving, becoming nothing again.
492 "Let us go, we must find a camp to stay and clear our thoughts.  I only wish I had the answers to a fifth of my 
493 questions."
494 Everyone heartily agreed, quite tired by the battle, the fast riding, and the exhaustingunset.
495 ++++++++++++++
496 "They're tired, Master, and should be easy to pick off.  Some strange things have been occurring in the valley, though."
497 "What, for instance?", Narfaal asked sarcastically.
498 "When I send someone out to shoot game, they come back with a carcass that revives almost as soon as it touches the pot
499 we cook 'em in."
500 "What?  By themselves?"
501 "Aye, We just throw them into the water the boys collected..."

504 The Last of the Wild Ones, by Roger Zelazny. Or possibly its prequel, Devil Car.

516 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
517    High on a finger of rock, shilouetted against the evening sky, a horselike 
518 figure, wings raised against the evening skyglow stood braced.  The muscles in
519 her curved neck stood out like cables under the soft white-covered skin, her
520 teeth firmly clamped in the woolen tunic of an unconcious figure that appeared
521 to have nearly fallen from their precarious perch.  With a single lunge, the
522 pegasus pulled the unconcious body of the piper from certain death as his
523 body began to topple off the precipice on which they stood.  Tugging him gently
524 to a small level area nearly free of rocks, she nudged him gently to straighten
525 his sprawled limbs, then carefully folding her legs under her, covered him with
526 one of her huge white wings.
527   The piper's conciousness was nearly a mile southeast of his body at that 
528 instant.  His crisis of concience had eased, but left him vulnerable as the
529 creatures of the Ruby Valley began their magnificent show.  His attention was
530 caught, and he had not even noticed as his body was left behind as he moved to
531 the center -- drawn like a floating chip into the center of a whirlpool.  The
532 glowing red patterns teased his mind along, looping swirls that nearly had
533 complete meaning, leaving partial questions nearly unasked, answering profound
534 questions with those of more profindity.  He had just noticed that the patterns
535 were not limited to the ground -- fainter and more subtile traceries filled
536 the air above the valley, seeming to center on a point slightly above a small
537 gazebo in the center of the valley.  Mesmerized by the increasing subtleties
538 of the ruby pattern, the essence of the piper passed over the rest of the 
539 party, unnoticed, shrinking into the infinite reaches of the pattern -- 
540 following it down, down, down the scale of size -- sensing far beyond a glow,
541 a power, perhaps answers for his stained and blackened soul.
542 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
543 increased his throttle? Hah! what amateurs! Car Warz ripoffs. We have seen
544 them before, and we will no doubt see them again. Poor Roger. If he only
545 knew what he had started.
546 && && &&
547 Images... Bodiless, floating, somehow sensing the flow of incomprehensible energies all around... Against the roar
548 
549 of power, a familiar touch... L'Homme? But he was on the "horse"... did he fall in transit? ...Gone now... helpless
550 in the current, the Poet moved to an unimaginable destiny... and exploded into icy cold air. Suddenly returned to
551 his body, he rejoiced, stretched, thrilling to the feeling of his muscles moving under the skin. Life! How sweet!
552 He turned his senses to the world outside and recieved a rude shock: he was falling! Apparently from quite a height,
553 too, as he'd been falling all through his reverie and the ground was still out of sight in the darkness below. Only
554 one chance: his emergency transport/shift device. Killing his momentum would take most, if not all of it's energy
555 reserves, but he had to not only get to the ground but dissipate the energy or he'd be splattered regardless...
556 As he began the adjustments, he passed through the last layer of cloud and saw the ground below. Suddenly his mind
557 was no longer on the fall, for he was seeing the most amazing pattern, formed by countless dancing crimson lights.
558 A mountain... a gate... an enormous army, destroying all in its path... a huge, golden bird...
559 The pattern shifted and dissolved, and the Poet realized he'd let himself go for too long; the ground was only a
560 hundred meters below! Frantically, his fingers found his device, twisted it to maximum dissipation, activated...
561 ...and he thumped bruisingly to the ground, amid the smell of burning insulation. His device had performed it's
562 final service, faithfully but self-destructively. So he was alive, for now; but with no way out of here--whereever
563 "here" was!
