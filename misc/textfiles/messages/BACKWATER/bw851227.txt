137 OK EVERYBODY, I HAVE AN IDEA FOR A GREAT CONTEST. EVERYBODY WHO REGULARLY USES
138 THIS BOARD WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER. EACH ONE WILL THEN TAKE TURNS SAYING THE 
139 GENERAL DISCLAIMER THAT APPEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY DISK, AND INDEED A
140 APPEARS EVERYTIME THAT ANY COMMAND IS EXECUTED. THE PERSON WHO GETS IT RIGHT WILL BE GIVEN A HEAPING BOWL OF EASTER
141 BUNNY STEW. I'M SURE THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE IT MEMORIZED BY NOW. 
142    
143    
144    
145 ON SECOND THOUGHT, THAT MAY NOT BE MUCH OF A CONTEST, EVERYBODY MUST KNOW THAT
146 DOG BY HEART, AND IT'S NOT NICE TO BRING UP UNPLEASANT THINGS THAT KEEP CROPPING
147 UP BY THEMSELVES.
148    
149    
150    
151 MIKEY: NO OFFENSE, BUT IS THERE A WAY TO JUMP OVER THAT THING AND GET TO THE 
152 TOP OF THE DISK? AT 300 BAUD, IT ROLLS BY AWFULLY SLOW, EVEN MORE SO WHEN YOU
153 HAVE SEEN IT SOME THOUSAND PLUS TIMES LIKE I HAVE.

155 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\31
156    Tariya walked down the corridor to James' room. It had been six days since he had regained conciousness, and they
157 had spent most of that time talking. She had come to know the Destroyer quite well, but it seemed that he was still
158 holding some things back. Well, he would tell her when he was ready.
159    She stopped at the door because she heard voices inside.
160    "-should be here at least another week! You're not healed yet!" This was the voice of Dr. Willerd Putzner.
161    She heard James' voice and her heart froze at what he said. "I don't have all that many weeks left! And I don't
162 want to spend them here. I'm going."
163    Tariya opened the door. Willerd walked out disgustedly. As he passed her, he said, "Your boyfriend's crazy, you
164 know that?"
165    "He's not my boyfriend and he's NOT crazy!" she called back through the door. James was putting on the clothes that
166 he'd had her bring him the day before. He already had his pants on and was putting on his shirt. She saw how pitifully
167 his ribs stuck out. An ugly red scar ran down his back from his shoulderblade to his hip. She saw how stiffly he
168 moved.
169    "You're gonna be wrong on that last count if I don't get out of here. I spent three months in this place not long
170 ago and I have no intention of spending another three."
171    He sat down and pulled on his socks. He reached for his boots and grimaced as he bent. Tariya said, "Here. Let me."
172 and picked up the boots to hand to him. Then she noticed a glint of steel from inside one of them. "What's this?" she
173 asked curiously, reaching inside.
174    "Don't-" James yelped, but too late. She held in her hands the two shot derringer James had used on the
175 Commander.
176    "This is a gun." she said. "Where did you get this? It didn't come from here and from what you told me they didn't
177 have any on that planet we were on. That means you must have had it since..." her eyes widened. James groaned and
178 wondered why he hadn't ditched the damn thing when he had the chance. "You brought this from your spaceship, didn't
179 you? Into the Crystal Palace, after what I told you. All this time I blamed myself for losing control of the spell but
180 it was actually THIS!" She held it in her hand and shook it in his face. "I TOLD you no technological devices were
181 allowed in there! But you went ahead and-"
182    "I forgot I had it with me." He said miserably. "Besides," he added brightly, "using it saved our lives."
183    "If you hadn't brought it, our lives wouldn't have NEEDED saving! You blamed me for what happened when you knew
184 full well it was your fault! You had to know! You hit me!" She threw the gun at him. He ducked it just barely, hurting
185 his back again. "You can do all the damned adventuring you want, but do it by yourself!" Before he could say anything
186 she stomped out the door and slammed it behind her.
187    "I'm sorry..." he said to an empty room.

193 On the way back to the Hilton,he saw the police cars, red and blue strobe li
194 running around, the gawk eyed, the rubbr necks, the tourists with Pentaxes around their necks. He saw
195 in front of the main entrance, the white clad attendants load the gurney into the ME's 'wagon'.
196 He saw the white sheet draped over a form, a form he had so recently looked down upon with such love.
197 
198 He knew. He knew what had happened, and he knew why. He had been gone but a half hour, and this
199 had happened.It was too much, and he broke down.   Tears streamed down his face, and he screamed out
200 loud, "Noooo, Linda,Oh God no, Linda,oh no no. He dropped to his knees, grasped the package he had
201 dropped, to steady himself. For a moment, he sobbed quietly, a rare expression of emotion, then he
202 composed himself. For a long time he had had little to lose. Now he had nothing. Grief gave way
203 to outrage,self pity acquiesced to anger. The bull of a man quietly walked away.
204 
205 When he bought the items in the package, he hadn't given any serious thought to using them.
206    They were insurance. The stainless steel bowls, the acids for making trinitrotoluene,fulminate of
207 Mercury,... But now it was different. 
208 
209 For a moment he wondered if Linda had died quickly, or had they...He banished the thought of how his
210 wife and children had died at the hands of McKanes assasins. He only wondered who. McKane again?
211 Parity? Wassir? China Blue? Pervis? That miserable little cockroach Young? Takes a real bad guy to
212 kill a helpless woman lying in bed... It didn't matter. They would all die. And know it was to be.
213 
214 He wondered if Parity remembered the case in Bhaunagar, India, when 14 kilograms of weapons
215 grade Plutonium hade been lost by net agents.  Parity knew what Delta Five could do with 14
216 kilos of plutonium, two large steel bowls, and some conventional explosives. So did Wassir. The Mayor
217 of New York was about to discover that he had another potential disaster on his hands. 
218 Mssrs Gorbachev and Reagan would have something new to discuss in Geneve.
219 
220 Delta Five burned up the interstate from Tucson to Phoenix, the six pack of Budweiser helping to calm his nerves.
221 He screamed the rented Mercedes around the corner of Speedway and onto VanBuren, east to the airport.
222 The arrangements were quickly made. Cash talks. Within minutes, Delta lifted the LearJet 24B off
223 runway 36 Right, and climbed steeply to flight level 45. He turned right till the directional
224 gyro read 011 degrees. He picked up the KingPhone, punched in some numbers, and as he turned left
225 toward his final destination, he spoke into the microphone, and declared war on the world.

253 One Long Saturday...
254     (Part 3)
255     
256      The chevy sped down the country road, passing two fire trucks and a police car going the other way. Inside the car
257 were six slightly singed aliens and one panicking human.
258      "Yes, we were bred to withstand the rigors of space travel. Our bodies were unaffected by the heat of the
259 explosion." Amogo explained.
260      Wonderful, Jim groaned. The little twirps were invulnerable. Time for plan B... as soon as he thought of one.
261 Maybe he could squish 'em.
262      Hey, why not? The scrapyard was closed today but he had a key. He turned to Amogo and said, "Say, how would you
263 like to try again?"
264      Amogo looked doubtful. "I don't know. Our bodies may not be able to withstand a blast of that magnitude
265 again."
266      May not? Good. "No, this is something different. I guarantee that won't happen again."
267      Half an hour later, they arrived at the scrapyard. As he hoped, nobody was there. He let them in with the key. The
268 aliens stared in fascination at the stacks of dead cars as Jim led them down a path amongst them. "Planned
269 obsolescence." He commented. "The American way of life." They didn't understand.
270      Finally they reached the end of their walk: A beat up '72 Ford Galaxie 500. It had already been stripped of
271 anything useful. Jim was going to smash it Monday but now was a better time. Now for a good story. "One of my fellow
272 humans was found dead in this car recently." Dead drunk, actually, but why bore them with details? "And the presense of
273 death brings us closer to God. What you have to do is get in the car, and I'll place it in a special isolation chamber
274 where you may attempt to communicate again."
275      Amogo didn't sound too enthusiastic. "Are you certain this is necessary?"
276      "Well, you've already seen what He is capable of. I really think you would be wise the square it with Him before
277 attempting an invasion. You never know what might happen if you don't."
278      "Yes. I see." Amogo turned to his fellows and spoke to them in a high-pitched language for a moment. To Jim they
279 didn't seem too enthusiastic, either. If they didn't go for this he had a problem.
280      Finally they agreed and got in the car. Jim, of course, couldn't join them because he had to work the controls.
281 Amogo didn't sound very surprised by this announcement. Jim climbed into the cab and started up the machinery. He
282 brought the electromagnet down on the car with a loud bang. Then he picked it up and swung it over to the crusher. He
283 placed the car in gently instead of dropping it like usual. There was no need to bang them around more than necessary.
284 He saw Amogo staring out the windshield as he climbed out. Again he felt a twinge of guilt in his heart. He didn't
285 actually hate the little guys, but it was them or us. Jim voted for us.
286      He went over to the crusher controls and stabbed at the red button. Immediately the motor thrummed to life. The
287 rumble rose to a loud whine and the lid of the crusher fell on the car with a slam that made Jim wince. To think, there
288 were actually living beings in there. He felt a little sick.
289      Jim couldn't see it, of course, but he could hear metal crumpling over the sound of the motor. And maybe it was
290 just his imagination, but did he hear screams? He resisted an urge to plug his ears. Finally the motor reversed and the
291 lid rose again. All was quiet for a moment. Jim got back into the cab of the crane and started it back up again. He
292 lifted a gray block of compressed metal out of the crusher and dropped it in the dust in front of him. He jumped out
293 and ran up to examine it.
294      Just an ordinary crushed car. Jim's seven years experience told him something was strange, though. The block was
295 about twice the size it should have been. So much for the alien invasion. And so much for six little guys he really had
296 nothing against. Tonight he was going to get very, very drunk.
297      As he turned to walk away he heard a noise, like someone crumpling a beer can. No. He spun and saw that the block
298 was shaking. It began to distort from inside. Then it split open like an egg. Out crawled six aliens, dirty but
299 unharmed. They formed a semicircle around an astonished Jim and Amogo said, "After much consideration I have come to
300 the conclusion that your God does not wish to speak with us at all."
301      "I think you're right." was all Jim could think of to say.
302

310   The thick door of the inn creaked slowly open, letting little of the 
311 vagrant breeze in to whip the flames in stately arabesques.  Little smoke 
312 was whirled out from the cavernous chimney to further stain the smoke
313 begrimed rafters of the great common room.  Few of the patrons noticed the
314 soft draught, and fewer still the figure that slipped quietly into the room
315 to sit alone at a back table.  Through fits of shivering, the piper soaked
316 up the warmth of the room, hoping not to be noticed.  How glad he was that 
317 he had not made a big announcement of his quest -- what a dissapointment to
318 return and report that nothing of interest had happened!

393        nasty, evil witch appearred hik
394        caught you now.  I'll have rbi

396        fast, but he stayed with hisbdy
397            The witch grabbed  Slowpk.H
398         can trade you something tha sb
399         rabbit stew, if you let us o.T

402              Slowpoke led the  witc oh
403           to invent things. His worso 
404           inventions. In  the corne ws
405           chair and three buttons-- e 
406      green button.
407          "I see that  you ride a bro"r
408       said "This is my new  rocket.Ims
409       more comfortable than  your bom.
410       and asked dryly "How does  itwr 
411       to the control panel  explainn T
412       that makes  you stop,  and th bu
413       go, but never ever touch the e u
414            The witch cried  "Ah ha a a

416         stepped toward the rocket  aki
417         red  button  must  do  somehn 
418          spoke fearfully "Never eve rs

428          someday. Let's go back andgts
429 
430               So  they walked  alon lw
431      down the road, that went  overteh
432      As they were  strolling, the wth 
433      ah ah  Ha ah!!!",  but she  ha o 
434      She dissappeared  over the  hoio.
435      and Swpoke saw  was the glare fth
436      sunset.
437         "She was kind  of a nice lay a
438      a lollypop  he pulled  out of hsp
439      replied Speedy "Very kind of hrt 
440             So  they  walked  along ai
441       picked, and  came to  the plae h
442       been. They found  only a appl te

447         like  pears  and  apples,  lot

458 Deja vu? Creator of Slowpoke and Speedy, may you be banished to Commode
459 Heaven for an eternity for subjecting us to that story not once, but
460 twice. You should know better, and I think you do!

463 	What do you get when you mix trench-coated spies, magicians, killers,
464 lovers, writers, doctors, vagrants, and fools? The Saturday meeting of
465 PorSFiS, and the get-together after. Fools you say? Yes, fools for sticking
466 around Bogart's Place for over 30 minutes before being asked if anyone was
467 interested in that rare commodity of food and/or drink. Service problems you
468 see, but not even that could not stop the great meeting of minds that
469 followed. Mysteries large and small were cleared up, and intentions that were
470 once shrouded are not much more identifiable. Of course that doesn't mean
471 the intentions have been changed or in any way modified, it is just that
472 they are known by a wider populace now.
473 	As usual, the PorSFiS part of the meeting offered little stimulation,
474 but it did serve as the one locale where everyone who intended on following
475 up with libations could meet. All involved expressed their thoughts on the
476 late and lamented PC&S, in whose place now resides a linoleum and stainless-
477 steel Deli. Group de Jour are probably spinning in their collective graves.
478 	The search goes on for a suitable rough-and-tumble establishment
479 where the Innhabitants can meet with drink and without worry. Bogart's,
480 regardless of their classy decor, just simply does not fit the bill.
481 	Because several people made a commitment to be there, Saturday's
482 meeting was a success. It proves once again the spied and doctors, under
483 the right conditions and with the proper truces in place, can meet with
484 friendly intentions, and not repeat those terrible happenings that
485 occurred in the Dragon Room, back in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, all those
486 years ago.

502 A person shouldn't have to endure such torture.  After PorSFiS, I went
503 roller-skating with an assemblage of 16 other Estacada '85 graduates.  All the
504 major universities were represented.  Since my last skating session was 4-5
505 years ago, the floor and I became very well aquainted.  I recieved first place
506 in the 'falls' division, with a grand total of 11, only 10 more than the
507 nearest competitor.  At last, in the final hour, my minimal skill returned and
508 I failed to log a single fall.
509 Now, after all that,, please refrain from mentioning the Dragon Room.
510 Thank you.

531 off
532 but Bogarts leaves a little to be desired. Elephantand Castle is a better place, lots of room for a group of people
533 and good service. But I hear that most PorSfis members find ten blocks too far to walk. Unbelievable. Anyway, whatsay
534 we commence with creating a new villan. L'homme, I forgot again the name of that guy you wanted me to insult. Wassir

558     BLACK WOODS AND DANK GROWTHS HANG DOWN, FORMING A LIVID SLUDGE OF DARK 
559 SWAMP. FRANK STARED OUT FROM BEHIND THE PLASTIC SHIELD OF HIS ESCAPE POD, AND
560 WONDERED HOW HE HAD EVER GOTTEN IN TO THIS SEWER. THE NEAREST MARKER 
561 TRANSMITTER WAS A GOOD 30 MILES AWAY, IF HE COULD SOMEHOW SLOG THROUGH THIS 
562 MUCK, A TRIP HE WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT MAKING. HE MIGHT BE FORCED OUT INTO
563 IT, THOUGH, IF THE MUD HE WAS SEATED IN BEGAN SUCKING HIS POD UNDER. TURNING 
564 IN HIS CRAMPED SEAT, HE RUMMAGED THROUGH THE FEW THINGS THAT HE HAD MANAGED TO
565 STUFF INTO THE POD BEFORE IT HAD CUT LOOSE. A GUN, OF COURSE, AND THE STANDARD
566 SURVIVAL PACK THAT WAS ALWAYS CONTAINED IN THESE PODS. HE PULLED OUT A LOOSE
567 NYLON PACK, AND BEGAN FILLING IT WITH THINGS FOR THE TRIP. AT LAST, AFTER
568 COMPROMISING ON PRACTICLY EVERYTHING, THE PACK WAS NEARLY FULL. SPACE WAS ONLY
569 LEFT FOR THE ONE THING THAT HE HAD SPENT YEARS FINDING. A GLITTERING BLUE 
570 CRYSTAL THE SIZE OF HIS FIST. THE STONE WAS NOTHING, UNLESS IT WAS USED WITH 
571 POWER AND INTELLIGENCE, BUT WITH IT HE HAD THE ONE CHANCE TO OVERTHROW 
572 THE CORRUPT GOVERNMENT OF HIS HOME PLANET. AT ALL COSTS, IT MUST BE BROUGHT TO
573 EARTH. +++++++++++++++++++00001TED++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
574 I may be wrong, and itmay just be the holidays, but this board sure seems to
575 be going downhill... fast.
576 I haven't called in for days and days and Ididn't miss a board like I expected
577 to. Pervis and Delta, keep up the dialogue, it's the only thing that's even
578 remotely interesting anymore.
579 Peter Rabbit? Slowpoke and Speedy? Not even any spicy dialogue, and the 
580 stories are lacking and/or non-existent.
581 How about some controversy? Let's see.......        I got it!  All negroes
582 are of lesser intelligence (on the average) than white folks!
583 So let's give South Africa to the whites once and for all and ship those
584 jigaboos to Afganistan or Morocco!
585 
586 Especially left-handed negroes... they're dumber than unborn Polacks!
