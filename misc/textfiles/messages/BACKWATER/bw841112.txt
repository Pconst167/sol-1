6                     THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be
12 periodically purged of messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
13 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out of the
14 ENTER mode. The message is automatically stored. If after entering the
15 message you find you made a mistake, use the replace command to replace
16 the line. To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
17 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.

21 L'homme: Added input; The problem with file control is your added
22 Random file control in crime. sub works fine on my basica on the H150
23 Once I take out the Random file control, Crime works on the Z150 too.
24 Other things. The minute you say COLOR in the Sanyo basic, it switches
25 to COLOR mode which is different then BW mode. Probably the simplest
26 thing to do is to ask if your color first thing, and if not disable 
27 the color cmds. Problem: Sanyo basic requires that you give the value
28 in a locate instruction. (LOC ,,1 is not valid.) Also, the POS cmd does
29 not have a value tag. (I.E. 'POS' not 'POS(0)'. There are other minor
30 differences, but these are the main ones that prevent it from running.
31 Forget what I saidd about the IF's, that was a mistaken identity prob.
32 (The reason for the color problem on the Sanyo, is that the minute
33 you select color, it goes to white characters (green is normal) and when
34 the sanyo is in white, it causes a BW monitor to flash on and off. 
35 REAL fun trying to read.) The other weird thing is the way you save a 
36 protected file SAVE "filename",Q They use 'P' to generate a normal
37 file, and 'A' to generate an ascii file. Lord only knows why they decided
38 to use 'Q', since it does the same thing if you add the 'P' or nothing.

42  The Innkeeper was shaken out of his stance at the door by the
43  shout from PAM to come join her in a Brandy. Grabing a bottle off
44 of the rack as he went by, he casually wandered over to PAM's table
45 at a sedate 50 miles per hour. Bowing over her hand, he exclaimed
46 "Welcome back! I was beginning to think you would never return!
47 I hope your stay will be long and enjoyable." Then filling her
48 glass and one for himself, he shouted, "A toast! To PAM! Adventurer
49 supreme!" 
50 sitting down, he looked sheepishly at PAM. "Sorry, I guess I got a
51 bit carried away there, it is good to have you back though. Do you plan
52 to stay awhile?"

55 Mikey : Maybe the best thing for me to do is come to USD and do the editing right on a Sanyo. That way I can see
56 immediate results for my changes. I don't see too many problems yet, except for  implied parameters in the LOCATE statement.
57 Could be a bit of a hack to fix that. The other stuff sounds like simple statement changes.
58 Leonard : Let's go to a good theater. Make that either Clackamas (fer sher at the mall), or Rose Moyer. I don't care
59 really. Rose Moyer is closer, but Clack has more teeny boppers. We should try for opening night. More excitement,

72 The vastness and glittering chill of the Diamond Valley were becoming more 
73 oppressive.  As we faced the obdurate machine and I considered the web of
74 forces opposing us I realized that we were a naive and hopelessly ideal-
75 istic band in a world of clever, ruthless, and hostile beings.  It occurred
76 to me that even if we solved the puzzle, it could be a trap.  Indeed, we
77 had no idea what to do even if we completed the necklace.  What if the power
78 it generated was not on our side?  Earlier I had told Friar Mossback that
79 we were in a real-life version of Bambi Meets Godzilla.
80 "Be serene. We will be fine."
81 "We will be steamrollered."
82 "You think too much of other forces, of this machine. Our minds are strong.
83 "Theirs are stronger."
84 "We cannot be resisted."
85 "They'll squush us like bugs."
86 Friar Mossback was highly amused by this interchange and remained calm and
87 alert.  He was actively looking forward to a bout with the machine.
88 So I was startled when he slumped to the glassy ground and lay without stir-
89 ring.  Piper and I rushed to him--there was no sign of life, his color was
90 drained, the face still serene. The one who had no fear had met the fate we
91 all feared.   The Piper, having no instrument, hummed a dirge and we con-
92 sidered magical ways of reviving or preserving the body. Many suggestions,
93 all dangerous.  So we wait and struggle with the code.  
94 L'homme claims to have broken it, but won't divulge it so I suspect this is
95 merely bravado.  A dreary time in a bleak land.

131 Hmm, looks like someone ate part of the last message.  Well, anyway, for those
132 of you who don't know, Rome going down next Monday.  It might be moving some-
133 where else, but who knows.  Anyway, for the interesting part, I'm thinking of
134 writing my own board that is like BWMS except that it would have a password
135 system (no endorsement, though) and there would be dividers between messages
136 saying who wrote it and when.  Do you people think that that would be a good
137 idea, or do you think that we don't need another Backwater-type board.  I would
138 appreciate input from BWMS patrons.  Thanks.

141   Walrus - Another BWMS sounds like a good idea.  I'm asuming that
142 	it would take the place of rome?  Still in L.O.  I do think
143 	it would be nice but there will still be your local yokols
144 	(jerks) that would call and try to crash it or just write
145 	their usual bad things.  But with the password system and
146 	the time and who wrote the message you wouldn't have any
147 	problem with obscene language.  (sorry, thinking to myself)
148 	That does sound good.  
149 	   What would be the name of it?  Any ideas?

162 L'homme: Rose Moyer sounds good.  By the way, while you may have deciphered
163 that inscription, you still flunked cCryptography 1.01. NONE of the NET ciphers
164 have been "simple substitution ciphers"! They have all been poly-alphabetic
165 ciphers. (A variant form of Beaufort cipher, I believe?)
166 I tried all 26 alpha shift ciphers on the inscription with no luck. Any hints?

196 Those of you working on cipher, you're trying too hard.
197 Alex; it was not meant to really warp the minds of those solving it- just twist a little.  As you can see from the 
198 other messages, it has succeeded.  If you want a REAL challenge for you cryptoanalysists out there, I can oblige, just 
199 say the word.
200 L'homme; I can't thank you enough for that printout, I'm working on the computer end and Mike is working on the disk
201 drive end.  I'm glad to help, just come by again.  Oh, got a whole slew of info on financial aid for colleges today, 
202 even an application for state colleges... I'm drowning in a sea of paper.

204 I had found my way cautiously to the Keystone, entered, then exited the room toward the Sapphire Valley side.  A short
205 walk to my door... but what is this?  A glow from inside?  I entered to investigate.
206 Milchar's body was lying on the bed as it was before, but an unearthly glow emanated from it now- the light that 
207 resulted from a clash of energy deep within him.  I stepped back, not knowing what to do.  The argentium I was holding,
208 however, did know.
209 The bit of rock I had carried here flew through the air, landing quite near Milchar's head.  Another glow, silvery in
210 color, began to grow and envelop him.  The auras about him clashed for a moment... the dampening field was clearly 
211 visible now, a sphere of maroon color being attacked by the silver.  Abruptly, the field began to fill with a strange 
212 white "substance", filling it entirely.  The argent aura smote at the bubble, and the white stuff surely pressed from 
213 within- for the bubble burst, showering the room with a brilliant display of color as it faded into non-existance. 
214 Odd... the argentium was gone too.  Oh, and Milchar was waking up.
215 ++++++++++++++++++++
216 One last thought- I have heard apologies from the management of Z100 all evening now, about something that the morning
217 zoo had said this morning.  Anyone know what it was, or why it was so offensive?  I find it hard to believe.

222 e Innkeeper was busy cleaning some tables in the Inn, When he heard a 
223 Screeching painful roar from outside the Inn. Followed immediately by a 
224 screem of great pain from his horse. Rushing outside, he found his poor 
225 steed laying on the ground with a gapping slash extending from the front 
226 shoulder to the rear haunch. Nearby stood a giant leaf eater casually 
227 munching on a pile of newly fallen leaves, blood still dripping from his 
228 claws.The Innkeeper was quit shaken by this unexpected attack on his 
229 faithful mount, but dutifully did what he must to insure the survival and 
230 hopeful restoration of the poor beast. "Don't worry ol' fellow, we'll get 
231 you fixed up as good as new in no time." Why did this have to happen now? I 
232 barely got him broken in, and already he is being attacked by monsterous 
233 beasts. I know the doc can fix him up so that no one will even know he had 
234 been hurt, but I will know, and so will my faithful steed, And what am I 
235 todo while he's healing? Arghhhh! Why me??!!

241 Ontho has slowed the disk for observation speed, as they approach the
242 island. Leo looks down skeptically, "how are we going to find anything
243 in this desolate place?" as she speaks a red flash is seen on the ground
244 about 3 miles away. Ontho zooms in to take a look. A large crevasse is
245 opening in the barren wasteland. Steam rises and molten lava seems to
246 be moving deep in the crack. A vehicle can be seen speeding away for the
247 flash site. Ontho moves the disk in closer to the racing object.
248      Leo raises the trident and shouts " Stop or be destroyed!" the small
249 craft doesn't slow one bit, but rather makes a futile attempt to escape.
250 It burries itself into the tundra so that about 95% is covered (kind of
251 like an ostridge) "Pow Pow" Ontho buzzes which in any language means
252 "let em have it!"  Leo raises the trident and her head and chants " Nuptune
253 awake, Nuptune awake".  A strange light leaps from the trident and plunges
254 into the earth near where the vehicle is buried.  The ground around the
255 vehicle vaporizes and leaves in int he open and quite intact. "Set it down
256 Ontho, they won't we going anywhere" Ontho hovers the disk about 2 feet 
257 off the ground and Leo steps off, trident in one hand (pistol in the other
258 remember plan b...) and walks towards the craft. It is not unlike the
259 disks they have grown acustomed to, but this seemed like an older model
260 with a protective cover. Which makes a lot more sense in this climate.

270 It was peaceful.  My mind worked at getting my body up again.  I realised
271 that I had no body, and no real physical sensation.  An odd feeling for a
272 person not used to having O.B.E.s, but not unpleasant.  I could here
273 the soft chorus of birds singing in the background.  Well, mot hear exactly,
274 but more feel.  I wonder what has happened to my companions.  "Do not worry,
275 they are safe."  A voice, very kind, came into my consciousness.  "That is
276 well.", I thought back.  "Can you read all my thoughts, or is there something
277 I need to do."
278 "I can read all of your thoughts, but I try to not  invade your soul to that
279 extent.", said the voice.
280 "May I ask who you are ?"
281 "You know me as "
282 "As who ?, I missed that."
283 "A label is not important.  It is merely a superficial device.  It is
284 sufficient that you know me now."
285 "Am I dead, are you God ?"
286 "No, and yes.  But then, are you not also God ?"
287 "I am merely a humble Friar."
288 "You are one of the supreme beings of all creation."
289 "I do not understand."
290 "Nor do I, but truth does not need understanding, it merely is."
291 "Can I go back and help my friends ?"
292 "If you go back to help your friends, you will prevent them from finding their
293 own truths.  That would not be helping them."
294 "I do understand." I thought a little longer.  "If I am a supreme being, are
295 you above that ?"
296 "No," said the voice, "I have merely been enlightened about the truth.  I do
297 not even pretend to understand all that I know, I merely know it."
298 "Do you know the purpose of the necklace ?"
299 "No, and yes, again.  I know the answer to your question, I just have not 
300 discovered that I know it.  You have the same knowing, as do all of your 
301 friends.  Truth is not created, it is."
302 "May I watch the progress of my friends ?"
303 "Answer that for yourself."
304 "I know the truth, and that is the reason for the necklace, and the power
305 behind it, is Truth."
306 "That is true also."
307 I decided to watch my friends, and held an image of the last place I saw them
308 in my mind.  I watched the puzzled looks of some, and smug complacency of 
309 others.  I saw the coming change in reality, and wanted to warn them, but
310 I saw also that they would not learn truth if they were warned.  I asked the
311 voice, "Are you seeing this, do you know what is about to occur ?"
312 "Even as you do."
313 We waited.

346                         CRYPTOGRAPHY  95
347 Lesson 1.
348         Within the word based alphabetic family of codes there are but two
349 alternatives to encipherment. One is monoalphabetic the other polyalphabetic.
350 Given these two possible solutions, the type of method used can easily be 
351 determined by a frequency count of the letters. If the frequency of occurance
352 is spread evenly across the 26 possible characters then the method will
353 probably be polyalphabetic. The converse will be true in the case of 
354 monoalphabetism. 
355         On examination  of this particular code we find a sharp pattern 
356 develop. ( I will leave it to you to do the actual analysis ). 
357 In the english language the frequency of the letters are as follows;
358         Letter          %       !       Letter          %
359         E               13      !       T               9
360         N               8       !       R               7
361         O               7       !       A               7
362         I               7       !       S               6

364         The frequency of the remainder would not be of statistical value
365 given this small a sampling. An error of +\- 3% is not uncommon.
366 If the ciphertext conforms to the normal distribution of letters in the 
367 english language then we are dealing with an arrangement problem. If not then
368 the alphabet has been shifted or scrambled in addition to being misarranged.
369         Now that you have completed the analysis, the next phase is to factor
370 the number of characters. This is done to provide the boundaries of the code.
371 ( Again both letter count & factoring is left to you ). 
372         The next phase, is the grouping of the code a factor of its length ?
373 That may or may not be significant. Assuming that it is ( at least initially )
374 what are the possible combinations using the grouping length as the basis ?
375 ( ie. halfing or doubling it ). Are these also factors of the total letter 
376 count ?. Using the various factor combinations whose product equals the letter
377 count I leave it to you to solve the cipher. As Brown Corpus says 
378                         " Remember the Matrix "
379  
380 Milch,
381         I am always up for a good cipher, provided its not a one-off pad, 
382 Army tranpostition ( whose solution depends soley on volume ), DES or RSA 
383 public key. Keep it within the scope of an amateur...
384 
385 DJJ- Did you recently change from a FSLIC to a FDIC ? 
386 
387 Leonard,
388         The man who first used polyalphabetics was Leon Alberti in 1465 but
389 it was Blaise de Vigenere that popularized its use in the 15 century.
390 Beaufort developed a variation in 1857 which is virtually the inverse 
391 function of the original cipher used by Alberti thus the Beaufort variant.
392 He was the same man that brought us the Beaufort scale of wind for the sea.

429 The Innkeeper went from one place to another trying to find 
430 someone who could heal his horse properly. Either they
431 were indifferent, or they could not do it. Finally, he settled
432 on a mending place in the middle of the nearby village
433 called "the gentlemen", as they at least seemed to treat him
434 and his poor steed with some measure of respect and goodwill.
435 They indicated that surgery would begin next week, and take
436 all week for full recovery. In the mean time, the Innkeeper 
437 must satisfy his travel needs with a rent-a-pony substitute.
438 Sigh, I hope it doesn't take too long. It just isn't the
439 same without him. Get well soon beloved friend.

459 Ahhh, back to 80 columns.  L'homme, If you're interested I have a term
460 program for the 64 that supports 40/80 columns and is meant to be as
461 close to a DEC terminal as possible.  I even have docs for it, if you 
462 can believe that.  The only reason I don't use it regularly is because
463 it doesn't support autodial.
464 Alex; Quite good, and complete.  The beginning stages you outlined I used
465 for the NET code, and it worked quite nicely.  However, you left out a
466 major factor in the solving of a good many codes: good luck.  It helps
467 more than you might think.  I shall see if I can whip up a code of 
468 the appropriate difficulty for you.  Nothing too hard, eh?  O.K.
469 All else; waiting for more people to solve the code.  Alex for sure has,
470 and I feel L'homme gained a good many clues from his visit to my abode to
471 solve it.  Read Alex's lesson above closely, he comes very close to doing
472 it all himself.  I shall check in again about tomorrow morning, if possible.

513 Voyeur : I would like an apology from you. BS indeed! I have better things to do than fool the likes of this bunch. I
514 was out at Milch's place, and he gave me a hint or two. As soon as I say the puzzle, I knew pretty much how to go
515 about it. I made one slight mistake, by forgetting to take into account the ending fill. The last word was slightly
516 garbaged, but Leonard set me straight. So there!
517 Milch : Glad the listing helped. If you ever need another listing, let me know. I have your magazines all copied, and
518 I should be returning them to you someday... I have VERY bad news on the fill routine. I can't use it. After 'unlimited'
519 memory on big machines like the VAX at school, and then 'lots-o-mem- machines like the IBM PC with 640k, I forgot that
520 there must be a limit to the stack a program can use with recursion. Consider my fill routine written in C. Every time
521 it is called, 15 bytes are added to the stack. Each point that is to be plotted requires one call, since it is a
522 variation of a flood fill. Now let's say I have 10,000 pixels to fill in. That's only 31.25% of the screen. That means I would
523 neet at the maximum point I would need 150000 bytes of memory for the recursion stack alone. Now even with 52k available
524 after switching out BASIC roms, no way jose'. On the C64, when the stack overflowed into the program, it returned
525 to BASIC. To test my overflow theory further, I duplicated the program on the TRS80 Alcor C, which, of course, has 
526 built in SETPOINT(x,y) and TESTPOINT(x,y). With everything else the same, and with a 13k stack, I could only fill about
527 3/4ths of the screen. What does all this mean? More 6502. You may be getting a call in the near future. Too bad we can't
528 work out a double purpose visit this Saturday(help me out after PorSFiS).
529 Alex : Are you still interested in the Apple Books?
530 Leonard : As I said before, perhaps my choice of 'simple' was in error, but its intended meaning was not. Our codes, at 
531 least until the last one, were simple, polyalphabetic or not.
532 Mikey : So sorry! I hope you don't think I normally conduct business this way. I have an excuse of sorts. What would you
533 think of a professor who had an assignment due at 5:15pm that utilized certain libraries that existed on a computer, but 
534 only under his catalog which was protected from ALL students? I had to run around most of the afternoon trying to find
535 someone who was a 'super user' who could get in. It turns out he admitted his mistake, and extended the due date. But in
536 all my running around, I neglected to find time to phone. I will call FOR SURE Thursday. Thanks for waiting...
537 All BWMSers : I humbly submit a proposal that anyone wishing to go along to the premier (Portland at least), of B. Banzi,
538 would certainly be welcome. We are shooting for sometime Friday night, at a theater yet to be determined(We'll know for
