22 "I'm going as fast as I can in these parts. I don't really want to wrap this
23 thing around a lampost, you know," mentioned Tina as she maneuvered the Benz
24 around the back side of the Portland Plaza. Even with it running smoothly,
25 it still wasn't the best thing to be in going around corners at a good rate
26 of speed. Things were almost improving until Tony noticed that they were coming
27 too close to the areas Police Headquarters.
28   "Hey, I know that the cops let alot of little things get by around here, but
29 isn't zooming by their stomping grounds just cutting it a bit short?"
30   "When I'm being followed by some un-friendlys like the ones behind me, I
31 don't really care where I go just so long as it gets me out of their way."
32   "Yes, that's a good point... Hey, watch out for that Fiat! Gee, What a 
33 bunch of nuts this town has running loose..." Tony thought that the guy
34 in the passenger seat looked familiar, but the last time he had seen his
35 fair-weather-friend was too long ago in Seattle. "Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey! Where're
36 you going now? This is a one way street! Didn't you see the arrows?"
37   "What arrows?" said Tina in shock as she wheeled another turn. "I didn't
38 even see the Indians..."  [Old joke- I couldn't refuse -J]
39 Suddenly, the rear window shattered into even smaller pieces as more shots
40 could be heard coming the car that was chasing them down the one-way street.
41   "Great, just we need right now. More ventilation." added Jack, his sence
42 of humor being the first thing to return to him as the drugs from the 
43 hospital began to wear off. "Any idea where we'll be going from here? And
44 who are those fools behind us anyway? Why would anyone get so worked up over
45 a little case of social peanut-buttering up?"
46   "I don't think that this is a social visit, Jack," said Tony.
47   "He's right, you know," concluded Marci. "It's for more than just a social
48 visit that I came to meet Tina again, not just some class reunion." At this
49 the smirk left Jack's face and he turned to look right at Marci. 
50 Looking back her, his care for what was going on around him vanished as his
51 thoughts of love came rushing back to ease his pain. "Hmm," was all he said.
52 Tony turned in his front seat to look at the other two as he was going to 
53 finally explain to Jack just what he had gotten them into, but decided to let
54 it wait for a little while longer. #I'll let him enjoy the ride for as long as
55 I can, but I've GOT to tell him what we're into with this,# thought Tony.
56   "I'm finally back around the U. of P.... I think I can lose him here, I 
57 used to do this all the time when we used to go here." said Tina over her 
58 shoulder to the othrers not knowing that Tony was the only person to hear her.
59 "Hang on! I'm going to cut around Buckly Center and try to ditch 'em past
60 Mehling Hall.." she added in a confident tone.  [sorry for sp of BC & MH -J]
61   "I think you lost them when you turned off the road and onto the sidewalk
62 back by the library," laughed Tony. "You've got to admit, not to many people
63 drive like that!"
64   "Hey, if you don't like the way I drive, stay off the sidewalks." added
65 Tina. It seemed that this desperate situation had taken away the harsh tempers
66 from both Tina and Tony. Teamwork seemed to be coming closer to them all now.
67   "I think it worked. Let's try to ditch the car and get into one of the 
68 buildings before someone spots us again. We can't stay in one place too long
69 anymore."   Marci and Jack were still oblivious to their surroundings.

74 	Taggart looked at Rosewood, who was now sprawled out on the floor after
75 having been knocked out of his seat by mere soundwaves, hands clenched
76 tightly around the earphones that were no longer around his neck.
77 	"Way to go, Billy. You want to get back into your seat now?" It was
78 his instructor who helped him back into his seat after seeing the after-
79 math of the frequency over-load. Billy just had that dumb look on his face,
80 the look that came naturally.         "I told you I'd get even with you for
81 having lost that kid back in the states, but you wouldn't listen."
82 	"How did you get even? It was that Semplers character that fed in all 
83 that garbage to the tapping equipment nextdoor..." Rosewood said dimly.
84 	"I got even because it was MY turn to monitor the outgoing calls."
85 said Taggart with an evil grin.              "But...  Oh." said Rosewood.
86 Taggart could see the little light come on inside Rosewoods head and 
87 prceeded to lean back quite relaxed in his chair, waiting for the
88 new orders as to what to do with all this wasted tape.

131   As Raza was headed for the door he noticed Dixie was motioning him back over
132 to the table. While he walked across the room she finished talking and put the
133 radio phone back in her purse. Before he could sit down she stood up, smiled
134 sweetly and said, "I talked with daddy and he says the cocktail party will be
135 breaking up shortly. He and some others are coming ashore for supper. We are to
136 meet them in about an hour and a half. Why don't we go up to my air-conditioned
137 room and find something to amuse ourselves in the meantime? I think he suspects
138 there is some hanky-panky between us. We wouldn't want to disappoint him."

144 	Arrg.... The persuader finally failed to give the desired result...
145 So in a fit of rage I wired past the offending relay ! !..Now I must dial
146 by hand until the part arrives...Arrg !
147 
148 Farley, Sorry I don't have two weeks to spare...But in the interest of 
149 saving time ... I would suggest you re-read the Crypto-Books that you have.
150 
151 Voyeur,
152 	I would start with the " The Code Breakers " by David Kahn..Its a
153 good primer ( massive 1,164 + pages ) covering most notable codes from 
154 ancient Greece to the present day. Followed by an oldie but goodie 
155 "Cryptanalysis" by Helen Fouche Gaines (1939)..Virtualy the amateurs bible.
156 After that you will have a pretty good idea where to go for more info.
157 Then pick up some scrabble solve books & If you can find one, a pattern
158 word book ie. ABCDEAB -> NEPTUNE    ABBACD-> ATTACK  they really help.
159 Along with frequency tables for diagrams  crossing/not crossing word boundaries
160 Hope this helps.
161 
162 Alchemist, 
163 	I will find the errant passage. Are you planning another venture
164 down the river this year ? 
165 
166 Leonard,
167 	Since I can't get the local boards until the part arrives...
168 ..Yes it may not be pretty BUT it works ...and I make no claim 
169 to being a programer..
170 
171 Riskers at large,
172 	I enjoyed the evening....HEH HEH... The next time we can play two
173 games of Nuclear Risk ...Just so my success ratio can return to it's nominal
174 value...& I will see if I can find some real VOL...
175 		DON'T LEAVE THE BOARD WITHOUT IT

183 days of the underground
184 
185 in visions of acid
186 we saw through delusion
187 and brain-box pollution
188 we knew we were right
189 the streets were our oyster
190 we smoked durban poison
191 and turned all this noise on
192 we knew how to fight
193 we dropped out and tuned in
194 and spoke secret jargon
195 and we did not bargain
196 for what we had found
197 in the days of the underground
198 
199 we believed in uevara
200 we saw that head held up
201 and our anger welled up
202 but we kept it cool
203 no need for machine guns
204 the system was crumbling
205 our leaders were fumbling
206 while we broke every rule
207 we saw them on tv
208 they'd blown their cover
209 and we tried to smother
210 their voices with sound
211 in the days of the underground
212 
213 what ever happened
214 to those chromium heroes
215 are there none of them
216 still left around
217 since the daze
218 of the underground
219 
220 now we can look back 
221 on the heroes we were then
222 we made quite a stir then
223 with our sonic attack
224 street fighting dancers
225 assassins of silence 
226 with make believe violence
227 on a hundred watt stack
228 they offered us contracts
229 we said we don't need 'em
230 we'll just take our freedom
231 we will not be boun
232 in the days of the underground
233 
234 and some of us made it
235 but not smiling michael
236 his black motor cycle
237 got eaten by rust
238 and john the bog dreamt that
239 he slept at the wheel
240 when he woke it was real
241 too late too have sussed
242 and jess was a poet
243 who wrote with a spray can
244 on walls saying : hey man
245 I BELIEVE WE HAVE DROWNED

256 To who ever wrote the message above-- I'm not going to give you any lessons
257 on manners and politeness, but may I ask WHY you wrote that? I would 
258 appreciate being graced with the knowledge very much (seriously...). If you
259 do not wish to talk of it here perhaps you can tell me privately on some 
260 other board. No kidding, I really want to know, I always like to hear the
261 the cause of opinions so drastically different from mine. If you do not 
262 reply, I will just figure that you are an assassin, acting out of stupidity,
263 with no actual understanding. Only out to destroy others, to be cruel to 
264 others. However, if you do reply perhaps I will get some insight. If you 
265 did write that because you really believe it, perhaps next time you could
266 explain why, as I said my opinion is quite the contrary. I'm just curious,
267 abit perplexed... trying not to be anonyed. Anyways, please respond. -Tanya

272 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
273 
274   the door flew open... a slim red haired man entered tileans room... sub machine gun ready at the hip... he was screaming...
275 drool flew from his lips... his head bobbed cherubicly... looking for the body...
276 
277   tilean awoke with a start... tried to remember the dream as best he could... it startled him... and memorizing the details
278 helped calm him... that face though...
279 
280   tilean lifted the telephone receiver... thought to himself that he ought to stop being so lazy... an agent in the field...
281   he was sweating... noticing every detail... the dirt under the phone dial... the phone number etched in the shining plastic
282 and even the russian cast to the features of the letter...
283 
284   tilean was scared... that dream seriously scared him... what could it mean...?
285   'hullo... this is desk...' said the small little voice on the end of the line... tilean translated... then uttered who he
286 was and what room he wanted dialed for him...
287 
288   this was all a mistake... i never should have even dialed the desk... i ought to have simply gone to markesson's room... why
289 did i call the desk... this scared tilean more than the dream had earlier...
290 
291   the rining of the phone and the immenant answering of it brought tilean back to the surface... in time to hear the tell tale
292 click of thephone being answered... the voice tilean recognized from the tapes was agent markesson... senior agent in this
293 satrap... local region...
294 
295   markesson was suprised to hear tilean identify... and with the secret stress clues of his voice.. tilean explained why he
296 was so early and where he was... in the same hotle with markesson... which suprised him again... tilean noticed worry in both
297 of their voices... and shame in markesson's...
298 
299   shame in tilean's too... it had been a long time since his days as a field agent... perhaps the shift to administations had
300 affected too dearly... perhaps he was not supposed to be an agent any more...
301 
302   it was his idea to personnaly take the situation out of markesson's hands... the excuse he had made was the importance of  
303 the soviet implications here... it was a false reason... although they were severely important... tilean was scared he lost an
304 edge that he once had...
305 
306   to an extent.... he had of course... the intense pride and sense of purpose that aided tilean in his ascention to leadership
307 was befuddled now... tilean wondered about his abilities... which deminished his pride... therefore his edge...
308 
309 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
310 
311   markesson heard the ringing... probably kurlevietch with some report about administrator coming early again... every version
312 of hell had broken loose in this small nation and the agencies in it when it was revealed that the famed thrike administrator
313 tilean would be arriving... the customary rumors started flowing soon after...
314 
315   sandra who lay next to him shrinked away from the loud phone... instinctively reaching for the phone... markesson realized
316 what his protectivity of the girl was... it scared him... had he lost his edge because of this girl...?
317 
318 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
319 
320   tilean lay down the receiver...easily avoiding the instinct to sleep... tilean put on the suit prepared for this satrap...
321   soon tilean would meet this markesson fellow... and see this markesson fellow... and find out why he sounded so shamed...
322   tilean relished the thought... all part of the job... tilean relished the very thought...
323

327 An interesting poem above.  I hope that none of the enlightened patrons of
328 the INN will associate the aftermath described in the poem with our agency.

333 To: All UNDERGROUND operatives
334 From: J.K. O'Hara, DSNAC, UNDERGROUND
335 Subject: Elite Operative Harry Foster
336 Our most successful UNDERGROUND operative, Harry Foster, recently volunteered
337 for testing of a new drug dubbed 'accelerotine'.  This drug, theoretically,
338 enables a man to move many times faster than normal.  Reflexes and reaction
339 time were also predicted to improve drastically.  Unfortunately, Harry seemed
340 to go berzerk after his first injection.  Dr. Juzem, head of research at our
341 medical facilities, reports that Harry
342 might well be completely out of his mind and should be considered extremely
343 dangerous.  He is to be found and brought back to UNDERGROUND's med labs 
344 immediately for further observation, alive.

352 Tanya>
353   It seems that your plea for an explanation has been answered, and assasin it 
354 was.
355 To all Assasins, bullies, bigots and other nameless critics>
356   I am new to the BBS'S, but even in this short time I have come to dispise
357 your technique of faceless attack.  If you have an opinion, state it, but
358 the definition of opinion includes the words "appraisal formed in the mind",
359 and so far I have seen nothing in your writings indicating that a mind had 
360 anything to do with your words.
361                " It is better to remain silent
362                  and be thought ignorant,
363                  than to speak
364                  and remove all doubt. "
365 To the INN croud>
366   Especially Melissa: Being a new visiter to the INN, I would like to say that
367 I am enjoying very much the writing that appears here.  Even the exploits of 
368 charaters whose stories begain long before I began poking my nose into these
369 glowing pages.  Probably most interesting is seeing the intertwining of person-
370 alitys through the system.  I thing that most of us feel that this is a way to
371 meet people with a new perspective.  In a way I feel sorry for the assasins, 
372 I think that their talents are so hidden from themselves that they feel that
373 thay are unimportant people, and that the only way to make themselves noticed
374 is to belittle others.  It must be a unfulfilling way to live.
375   Sorry I do feel, but not charity.  A shallow puddle will remain a shallow 
376 puddle no matter how much I water I pour into it, it will never become a lake.
377 Likewise there is no way to rid the world of puddles, for the next rains will
378 loosen the mud, and it will collect in the low places again.

387      Others find shifting scenes of joy and sorrow,
388      Color and spectacle fill their seeing.

392      Guardian & Company, there is also the possibility that you and your
393 band of followers have begun to perceive the nature of reality more clearly.
394 Another possibility being that I, noting some of the characteristics of your
395 perception, have modified the form of expression to limit the possible
396 interpretations, thus making it less likely that an over-active imagination
397 would add unintended meaning from its own mind (the foregoing exempted). An
398 Inn-famous expression around these parts, that may have been before your
399 time, goes something like this: 'Things are not always as they seem!'

403   I just wanted to say that I love your poems. Especially the "Again the dawn,
404 what does it bring?".
405 tilean
406   I find your story very interesting reading.  The most human of the "Secret
407 Agent" storys now going.  I recall someone commenting on the lack of character
408 development in the spy series.  You have stilled his tongue.  I also think 
409 that the multiple perspectives are a great tool.  You are kind to share your 
410 story here.

439     Now that Ive let my ego shrink...
440 
441     The back seat on the Benz was a mess to be sure. broken glass was every
442 where, Jack and Marci were holding each other close while Tony barked orders
443 to Tina."Tina let's get out of here, I don't see them anymore." Tina's response
444 was cool. "My dear, now I remember why we stopped seeing each other on personal;
445 basis, but your right; I do believe my fine driving has helped us escape our
446 would be assasins." Tony smirked " Your incredible, whatever you wish my pet;
447 but lets try to get poor Jack someplace where he can rest."
448     Tina slowly cruised from the campus, trying hard to hid a 1984 Benz sedan
449 with a gapping hole where the rear window should be. Marci now was starting
450 to grasp at reality on just how expensive this evening had turned out to be.
451 Thinking to herself,  this had better be worth it, she looked a Jack, his head
452 resting on her breast and thought of his terrible pain. "Home Tina" commanded
453 Marci in a joking voice. "As you wish" responded Tina potraying the perfect
454 driver.
455    The drive home was pleasently uneventful. And soon Marci, Tina, and Tony
456 were sitting in Marci's Condo overlooking the view of the city lights. Jack
457 had been put to bed and the rest of the trio were trying to losen up with
458 a  nightcap. Heaven knows they all needed a stiff one.

460     I speak as one who has never really insulted someone the way that Jack Anderson did a while ago on CBBS Aloha.
461     I speak neither as a person who baselessly insulted someone the way the some unidentified person did on this system.
462 
463     I do however understand their position and opinion, and have found that calling them stupid is simply wrong.
464     Although the unidentified person on this system did nothing to prove his intelligence, he did nothing to disprove it.
465     Instead, he showed a remarkable capacity for rudeness.  I see a lot of hate there, but that is a different matter.
466 
467     I know that I have resented the gracefull way that some people dominate systems fora little while, and I do not mind.
468     And yet, I know I have seen people with stolen styles of writing that do not make any special sense, but sound neat.
469     It is this mindless drivel that I notice receives so many anonymous attacks.
470 
471     I remember one series of messages that follows the familiar, female user leaves public message, carbonates some male user 
472 ormones, and a series of mutual admiration messages follow.
473 
474     It may be none of their business, and it may be pleasant for some people to see these messages exchanged.
475     I however, resent it quite much, that resentment burns like a itch which cannot be scratched without insulting someone.
476 
477     If these attacks were signed, with the name Voyeur, or Kathy, or Adrian, that person would be scathed forever.  Ostricized
478 in fact.
479 
480     I saw one person, Jay Anderson state simply that someone was leaving and receiving so many messages full of drivel, that
481 other people were reticent to leave messages also.
482     Although I disagree with the point here, I note that it was that ceaseless itch which provoked the harsh response.
483 
484     I am not a cruel woman, or a cruel man for the sake of anonymity, but I understand why these messages are left.  And it
485 occured to me that I could inform a lot of people about their hypocracy.
486 
487     Seeing someone make unfounded remarks like 'Stupid' and 'Idiotic' about someone smacks of hypocracy to me.
488     They rightfully resent being insulted, but they turn around and do the same thing again for the exact same reasons.
489 
490     It is anger at having their intelligence threatened I think, which provokes both attacks, and because they both attack ech
491 other, there is hypocracy.
492 
493     And no room for hollier than thou attitudes such as the ones expressed above.
494     And yet, once attacked in this manner the offended person is placed on a pedestal after leaving equally harsh returns.
495 
496     I understand that not everyone does this, but it is the skepticism in me of having seen these same events occur over and
497 over without any change speaking in me.

502   On a high bluff overlooking the ocean, facing the east and watching for
503 the false dawn, the piper sat.  Lines etched his normally carefree face --
504 fatigue and a nearly unspeakable loss.  Behind him, a soft scuffle in the
505 darkness, a shiver of wind through velvet nostrils, and a large shape
506 moving through the darkness, barely visible in the pre-dawn glow.
507   The pegasus walked up to the piper and rested her head on his shoulder.  
508 Reaching up, he caressed her muzzle, then sighed deeply. 
509   "Peg, it's about time to leave here.  You are healed, our debt is payed,
510 and the journey to the inn is long."
511 As the morning sun cast her first rays over the waters, the pegasus and her
512 rider disappeared-- a fading black dot in the glowing sky.  Behind they left
513 a sand beach -- a line of hoofprints fading into the water -- and perhaps
514 the eyes that viewed the prints were blurred, not with tears, but with the
515 sand cast up by a gentle breeze.

518 napoligic-- No they are not stupid. Wrong, I was for saying so. But, through 
519 thier uncontrollable itch, they hurt someone, very bad. If you'll stop and look
520 at all the people who recieve these attacks, the destructive ones, they are 
521 usually people who really can't stand under attack (unless the attack was given
522 as a rebutle to another). They don't say to those people who are very confident
523 very strong in they position, "You've got awful writing, get the hell out of 
524 here." No because those strong people would say something which would cause the
525 rude person to be far more belittled then they had attended for thier victim.
526 They attack only those that show some soft spot. With destructive critism. That
527 is what I can't stand. A person writes, maybe it's not very good (that sound 
528 familiar?), but they write, they expose a part of themselves. It's opening up.
529 Sharing what they feel, making it real for others, and the others feel it too.
530 There is so much fear in that, yes, so much fear. But from what I have seen, 
531 they do not attack those who are already walking, not those who have been for a
532 time, but those who are taking a first step... such a blow could cripple.
533 This pains me, to see one who is just learning to walk (like myself) to be 
534 knocked down, by the burning resentment of another. I try, I try and give them
535 a hand up, like those have done for me. Hypocritical, perhaps I am. But I see
536 that step, that opening up that we have always taught to hide away from others,
537 I can't help it. Perhaps, the attacker can't help it. Then I am no better, I 
538 never claimed to be. I never said or thought I was. In all, I am learning to 
539 walk, I can not bear to see others knocked down. Perhaps, I am knocking others
540 down, like I did to Brutus, I don't know what is best, I think defending the 
541 one being attacked, I think.... okay, done. (One last point: Jay's attack did
542 not stop at one blow, the sysop only asked that if he was going to critize to
543 make his messages private. It was not one blow, no it was not
544 ) oops, enter only, sorry about that. -Tanya

555      hawkwind,,, yes we are back, but this time we have no poem to 
556 right no one we want to bloott or freeze are flight...
557   here at backwater we thought we had a place to enter our writings, even
558 if we don't have any talent whatsoever.  But it seems that some people
559 probably with an even lesser talent than us don't feel the same  way...
560 one of the reasons we have not yet revealed our true identity is because of
561 the preceding reason...  here we thought we could express our deepest feelings
562 and we started to build our hopes as this being the place,,, the place i'm sure
563 we all have dreamt for,,, a righting utopia a place where we can be free to 
564 express our innermost feelings through our writings,,,(no matter what style).
565 and now we see this and our creativity is blurred from the fear of being 
566 rejected!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
567 to MELISA : we show sorrow for you as we love your writings and only can dream
568 what happened? 
569  such talent and be able to show it even after of what has happened.
570 and to KATHY : we also loved your last poem and only wish that we were as 
571 talented as others of this world.
572 to ASSASSIN(S) : we feel pity for you my friend as we can only try to see  what
573 the purpose of this malicious plee of yours, 
574          maybe someday there will be a perfect utopia for us but as of now thereis only hope,,,
