21 THE INNKEEPER LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SAW THAT THE INN HAD EMPTYED OF 
22 CUSTOMERS AND DECIDED IT WAS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY TO CLOSE FOR A WHILE. 
23 STEPPING OUTSIDE HE MOVES TOWARDS THE STABLES AND PREPARES TO SADLE HIS 
24 STEED. SOON THE POOR BEAST WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED. HIS OLD BONES 
25 RATTLED AND HIS GAIT HAS NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE TRIPPING ON THAT ROOT 
26 THAT BROKE HIS LEG. THE INNKEEPER WOULD HAVE LONG SINCE REPLACED HIM, BUT 
27 IT IS SO HARD TO PART WITH SUCH A DEPENDABLE AND FAITHFUL OLD FRIEND. BUT 
28 NOW THE INNKEEPER COULD SEE THAT THE TIME WAS NEAR. THE POOR THING COULD 
29 BARELY HOLD HIMSELF UP LET ALONE THE ADDED WEIGHT OF THE INNKEEPER. AS HE 
30 RODE OFF DOWN THE ROAD, THE INNKEEPER WONDERED IF HIS FAITHFUL STEED 
31 SUSPECTED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS TRIP WAS TO FIND A REPLACEMENT?

82 will have to skip this one.  It sounds intriguing, seeing all of the BW people

119 In his pentagram, Milchar chants the final words to complete his travel spell.
120 'Unless others use this PARTICULAR spell, they cannot reach the Ruby Valley
121 for another week!' , Milchar exclaims to himself.  A column of silver flame 
122 envelopes him, and when it clears, he is no longer where he was.
123 This new place was very strange, by anyone's standards.  One-half of the sky
124 lit, the other half, dark as night.
125 Stars speckled both halves of the atmosphere.  The terrain around him was 
126 very rocky and barren,  and the rocks themselves changed color constantly, as
127 if unsure of what portion of the spectrum to reflect.  The whole area seemed 
128 to generally reflect Chaos, and then again, it just MIGHT have emitted Chaos 
129 instead...

153 Phoenix:I'm not sure that 'Phoenix' is the correct spelling for the legendary
154 bird of ressurrection, but I'll let that pass.  You seem familiar, and Icannot
155 help but wonder if your previous 'handle' was not ARCHER.  Why do you change 
156 names so often?  Why not keep the old name, and so then others will learn what
157 to call you?  Are you so confused that you do not know your name? 
158 ++++++++++
159 I wish tto give a warm welcome to the Doctor, who will be on BWMS more often 
160 now that he has recieved (perloined, borrowed permanently, snatched, stole)
161 a modem of his own and does not have to use mine.  Let's get a Dr. Who argument
162 going!  I tire of the old religious argument as the people here have raked all
163 the muck in that area.  Anarchy has its appeals, but can be dismissed as 
164 generally unfeasible for the reason of too few people can handle complete 
165 freedom.  A typical example is that of the average schoolchild: he could no
166 more do all of his studies alone than could we handle all of our affairs alone.
167 True, there are exceptions to both the example and the government question, but
168 in general, it holds true.

170 Milchar walks briskly along, forming the correct images in his mind as he 
171 walks past a concrete bridge, a castle, a jousting tournament, and finally,
172 he enters a gigantic forest of conifers. The trees themselves are hundreds of
173 feet tall, and the brush along the path Milchar walks upon is as tall as a 
174 house.  A hunting horn sounds in the distance, and hounds that could not have
175 been spawned from this earth began to persue.

244 Lets see, someone asked the names of the sons of Jamis:
245   Kaleff (natural son of Geoff) and Orlop.
246 Apologies, Aaron.  I sometimes have a hard time seperating truth from jest.
247  On this board it is particularly difficult, given the fact that some in thier
248 seriousness are inane. (yes kiddies, I mean you)
249  Well, the number sequence is still out there; if it is not solved
250 soon I shall have to rewrite it before it rotates to drive C.
251 I've got two more, an easy one and a hard one. the easy one first:
252  A ship is at anchor.  Over its side hangs a rope ladder with rungs a foot apart
253 The tide rises at the rate of 8 inches per hour. At the end of six hours
254 how much of the rope ladder will remain above water, assuming that 8 feet
255 were above water when the tide began to rise?

300 L'homme: leaving messages to the same person on different boards is
301 getting confusing.  I was on CBBS/PCS, got a msg from you, answered it,
302 went to CBBS/NW, and found another msg from you containing info which
303 essentially caused the /PCS msg to become redundant. I remember the
304 days when I couldn't find ANY boards.  Such is progress.
305 Speaking of progress, the fruits of yesterdays transactions have so
306 far been about 33% productive.  25% turned out to be immediatelyinaccessable
307 due to an apparent oversight on your part. (I know, you were just
308 trying to get me out of the house so you could watch your friday night
309 videos).  I shall attempt to confer with you by voice Sunday.
310 MIG: did you know that the way to enter private messages on CBBS/PCS
311 is NOT by making the subject "MESG" but by making the Password "MESG"?
312 I logged on under a different name and tried to read the msg you left
313 me, and sho' nuf, there it was!  Just a good thing that there wasn't
314 anything REALLY private in it.  Hope Kelly wasn't TOO bored Saturday 
315 afternoon.  You'll just have to get her into BW.  After all, BW can
316 use all the ladies of the female persuation it can get.  I enjoy their
317 writing styles.  I seem to read more McCaffery, Bradley, Norton, PAM, 
318 than a lot of male authors (this sentance is slightly garbled, oh well).
319 Back to L'homme: did you notice that the address in the message you sent
320 while I was at your house disappeared? (another weird sentence; I hope
321 this isn't becoming a habit).  Don't worry, I put it back.
322 As it is now 04:37, even I should go to bed.......

343 Milchar casts a spell in haste, for the hounds are nearly upon him.  The break
344 through the huge underbrush just as he completes the enchantment.  He rises 
345 into the air, above the snarling hounds below.  Milchar gives the whole matter
346 not a second thought, but quickly guides himself along by the newly gained 
347 power of flight, toward a shining city at the horizon.
348 +++++++
349 To all:Here's another puzzle:
350 Separated into three groups, the first 13 letters of the alphabet are as 
351 follows:
352 Group 1:A E F H I K L M
353 Group 2:B D G J 
354 Group 3:C
355 The puzzle: Determine what the three groupings are, and where the remaining 
356 13 letters belong.
357

362      I watch as a flash of silvery light appears in the valley below.
363 Milchar must have just arrived, good, he will distract those hounds for
364 a moment, giving me a chance to rest.
365      I look at the chonometer on my wrist, about four hours untill the map
366 appears, a lot of time to wait with all of the unnatural things that are
367 around. But if I could get to Milchar, between us we just might manage
368 to stick around long enough. I pull out the laser to signal to him, and
369 dive into the bushes as a large shadow passes overhead...

382 Milchar is suddenly startled by a huge winged animal that is chasing him!  
383 A little shaken by this turn of events, he cannot shape the shadow-stuff enough
384 to send the beast away.  'At this speed, the Wyvern will surely catch up.'
385 Milchar notices a figure diving into the underbrush.  'Well, whoever THAT is

396 My goodness you fellows are having a difficult time of it.
397 It's really not necessary, you know. If you'd had the forsight 
398 to puchase a cognative transmogrification gun from Mr. McKane 
399 things wouldn't be so difficult for you now.
400 
401 Perhaps it isn't too late. I don't know though, you really are 
402 in the thick of it...but it wouldn't hurt to ask.

407 Mohammed:
408 
409 You really ought to do something about the Ninja. After all, 
410 this talk of blowing up planets is getting a bit out of hand.
411 Oh sure, a little war here or there is OK; but blowing up 
412 planets? That's going a bit far...don't you think?

425 HIM AND USE HIS COLLECTIVE PARTS FOR A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSE,
426 LIKE A LAWN MOWER. IN THE TIME HAWTHORNE THE ILL-DESIGNED HAS

459 Milchar quickly searches among all his robes and pulls out a slender wand, 
460 sliver-tipped and sparkling.  He sends a nebulous yellow beam toward the Wyvern,
461 who almost avoided it.  The Wyvern wimpers slightly, as it gets smaller and 
462 smaller with each passing second.  Finally, the poor thing is no smaller than
463 a fly, and it flies away, frghtened.
464 Milchar then brings the Amulet of Zelgar into play, causing a "hole" of about
465 a foot in diameter to be created nearby.  He deftly points the wand into it,
466 chants a small spell, and waits.  He hears a loud 'Yiiiippesss!!' from the 
467 strange hole.  'I do enjoy new spells- Transmogrify Salesperson is a lovely
468 one!'
469 He decends quite near a small stream, and waits for The Traveller to show up.
470 Soon, The Traveller breaks though the underbrush,not looking at all fresh
471 and clean as he usually is.  'Quit playing in the brush, if you'd like to see
472 the Ruby Valley!', exclaims Milchar.

476        found out and restored the message to its former state. That'll teach
477        you. Sure you can erase it again, but either I or my agents will

486 Milchar: Thanks for the spell, but I have solved the problem with my own two
487  part spell. 1) Upgrade internal RAM in model 100 to 512k. and
488  2) Bring up DBase II on model 100. I am having a friend who is a

562  
563      I am walking unsteadily, rain pouring unnoticed upon my head.  My hair
564 is slicked down, my clothes soaked from the lack of coat or other protec-
565 tion, but my mind is elsewhere, as it was when I rushed hurriedly from my
566 home at the sudden call at 3:30 in the morning.  As I trace an uncertain
567 path down the concrete toward the roach infested brownstone I snidely call
568 home, in my mind I cling to the suddenly frail hand of this dearest of
569 friends as she convulses and gasps out her life.  If only I had been there
570 to stop her, if only I hadn't been too busy to go with her, so damn many if
571 only's!  But there is only what is, and that is a thing that once was my
572 friend, cold and lonely on a antiseptic table, covered by a sanitary blue
573 blanket.  The vision of holding her hand is still there, so strong since I
574 wasn't there to do so in reality.
575  
576      Starting from my bed, I awaken suddenly to sweat stained sheets and
577 tear covered cheeks.  The vision is still strong in my mind, and in the
578 darkness I can still see the rain slickened streets of that time.
579  
580      I leave my bed, taking the blanket with me, and walk to the window
581 wrapped in it.  The night is clear, the waxing moon shines gayly above, but
582 it only brings a shiver to me.  Oh Sandra, it's been so long since then,
583 but I still love you.  Why did you have to go?

593 overpower your life, for life still continues. I too am in constant battle
594 to fight it, But it must be released, or it will overwelm you, and that
595 is not good. I hope you are not delving to deeply in this hurt.
596 I would hate to loose you as well.

604 
605      d, I only hope that you are correct, and I wish I had your faith.  Your
606 words are comforting to me, and they remind me that there are still many
607 things in the world that I neither know or understand.  Thank you, friend,
608 sometimes such words mean a great deal.
609 
610      You needn't worry about this little episode too much Tarn, as it is
611 something that I have grown used to with time and the marvelous ability of
612 the human mind to adapt.  I don't dwell on it too deeply or at too great
613 length, but it does occasionally come back to stir my emotions through my
614 dreams.  We all live on after trying events, we all adapt to the way things
615 are, or we simply will not survive.  And most of all, I am a survivor, I can
616 deal (for the most part) with life.  Though sometimes I keep it at arms
617 length.......
618 
619      It seems that I once again have the somewhat dubious privilege of pick-
620 ing up after the other patrons.  Ah well, we all have our places in life,
621 and the back tables are somewhat apropos for the place and style I have
622 chosen for myself.  I suspect that the good Innkeeper is still having prob-
623 lems with unruly patrons, or this portion of the Inn would be easier to work
624 in.  
625 
626      Having cleaned the table, and having spoken at length with the good
627 Innkeeper, I pick my belongings up and head for home, and bed.
