46    "Ohhhhhhhh...  aaahhhhhhhhh.... OHHhhhh...AAAHHhhh..."
47 Waves of unbearable ecstasy passed through my body, leaving me limper after
48 each thrust as it went deeper and deeper
49 crescendo of indescribable pleasure, I cried, "stop, please, Deborah, stop!"
50 Her hands slowed their motion as she leaned closer and asked, "what was that,
51 Josh?  I couldn't quite hear you."  "I said 'stop'.  I've had enough today."
52 "OK, Josh.  Same time tomorrow?"  "Uh, yeah, sure.  Of course."
53 I watched her as she picked up her stuff and headed back inside the building,
54 striding stongly along with the sun shimmering off the fine shean of
55 perspiration coating her well-muscled (and quite visible) physique.
56 Damn, I was lucky.  Debbie was the most sought-after masseuse here in Nirvana,
57 and *I* had her.  RHIP, and I no longer had any qualms about taking advantage
58 of mine.  I had earned them.
59    I started thinking about what to do the rest of the day.  Racquetball?
60 Tennis?  Maybe tune up my fencing skills with Francois.  This evening, in any
61 case, was set aside for the Chemin de Fer game with that hot-shot from
62 England.  He was going to show me some tricks, I was going to show him some,
63 then we'd swap lies about how we did it to the nasties before they did it to
64 us.  Ah, life was great in NET's R&R center, affectionately known as 'Nirvana'.
65    "Ah, Joshua, there you are!"  Damn, I spoke too soon.  Here comes Ian, and
66 judging by his patently artificial joviality, he's got work for me.  Oh please
67 let it be something minor.  "I've got a little job for you, Josh, but don't
68 worry, it's just a minor little exercise to get you warmed up before we put you
69 back in the field for real."  He sat down on a poolside chair, which creaked
70 ominously beneath his impressive bulk.  As he spoke, I watched one of the
71 chair legs, which seemed to be having trouble with the excess stress.
72 "As you know, Texas Instruments has been having problems with their quality
73 control, and we've been receiving an unacceptably large quantity of defective
74 parts.  Since so much of our work is dependent on our electronic equipment,
75 this is intolerable.  So we've been looking for a new supplier.  I think we've
76 found them, and I want you to go out there and check out their security.
77 They're located in Silicon Valley North, which is one reason I'm sending you
78 out there, since I know you're familiar with the area.  Their credentials are
79 quite impressive.  They are the major supplier for the Space Shuttle, the
80 Trident submarines, IBM, and DoD.  They are also substantially cheaper than
81 any of the other major suppliers... " While he droned on, I was watching the
82 crack in Ian's chair creep slowly along the weakening leg.  My attention was
83 suddenly snapped back to his words when I heard him mention "... the company's
84 name is OMI, and I have set up a cover appointment for you..."  He broke off
85 and looked at me in surprise.  I was laughing so hard I could barely catch my
86 breath, but finally I managed to wheeze, "OMI?  Ian, you've got to pay more
87 attention to what's happening in the world.  That joke is so old, nobody falls
88 for it any more.  It's just some juvenile hacker with delusions of grandeur who
89 keeps submitting bids to anybody foolish enough listen.  I thought everyone
90 knew that by now."  Ian frowned at me as I went off into gales of laughter
91 again.  Finally tiring of my lack of respect, he started to push himself out
92 of the deck chair.  The sudden strain finally broke the weakened leg, and the
93 chair collapsed.  Ian, off balance, waved wildly as he fell towards the pool.
94 I saw it coming, and dropped to the ground, covering my head with my hands.
95 Ian struck the water, and there was a sudden loud hissing and sparking.  A hot
96 bit of metal landed on my neck, and I brushed it off as I got up and looked
97 into the churning water.  Tsk tsking, I went to the intercom and paged the
98 office.  "Ada, you'd better break out a new Ian.  He fell into the pool, and I
99 guess they don't have the waterproofing perfected yet."  Looking over at the
100 tangled pile of gears and electronics at the bottom of the pool, I said
101 wryly, "you might say it's another case of doused ex-machinery."

106 UNDERCOVER (Part four)
107 by John Silverman
108 
109 He no longer felt cramped. Indeed, he felt nothing at all. His mind was
110 slowly becoming as numb as the rest of his body.
111 
112 His slide into insensibility was interrupted by the loud bang of a door
113 being thrown open. Fear brought him back to alertness as he heard two
114 grumbling voices approaching.
115 
116 "-why we have to come back down into this mess again."
117 
118 "Because this goddam door has to be secured, that's why. I swear, that
119 Mandell's got his head up his ass. This should have been done hours ago.
120 Anybody could'a snuck in right behind our backs."
121 
122 "Naw, we had Lewis watching... Hey! Look here! We must've missed one."
123 Frank almost jumped right out of his skin. The game was up. He wondered
124 to go for one of their guns, if he had the chance.
125 
126 "What are you talking about?" The other voice was distant, over by the 
127 emergency door.
128 
129 "Busboy or something. Crawled all the way over here. He's dead now, though."
130 This voice was right next to Frank. He relaxed a little, but not much.
131 
132 "Goddammit, will you get over here and help me with this?! Jesus!" Frank
133 heard the footsteps walk away from him and there were several moments 
134 of bangs and grunts.
135 
136 Finally, "There! They'll have to blast their way in, now. What the hell
137 was this about a busboy?"
138 
139 "I counted eight holes in him and he still crawled all the way over to
140 that laundry cart. I wonder why."
141 
142 "Who cares?" The man sounded tired and somewhat less than interested. 
143 Frank heard the footsteps coming back his way. He almost jumped again when
144 something hit the cart hard.
145 
146 "Jusus H.- " The man hollered in pain. The cart was hit again much harder
147 and rolled into a wall. Frank was almost startled into yelling.
148 
149 "Goddam thing weighs a godadam ton!!" the man yelled.
150 "If you watched where you're walking... "
151 
152 "One more word and I'll put eight holes in YOU! C'mon, we still got a lot
153 of stuff to do!" Frank heard two sets of footsteps (one set limping)
154 walking away, and then the door slammed.
155 
156 He had almost been undone by a clumsy jerk. For some reason he thought that
157 hilariously funny. He started giggling uncontrollably. It took him a long
158 time to stop.

184                               OLD HANK       (Part 2)
185      Abruptly, the old man left the light of the window and walked uneasily
186 down the sidewalk toward two policemen who stood at the corner
187 under a streetlamp.  As he struggled silently past them and rounded
188 the corner, the younger officer grimaced and turned his face away.
189      "Jesus Christ!  You'd think they could at least hose these
190 animals down before turning them loose on the street," he said
191 disgustedly.
192      The older one chuckled as he chewed on a short, stubby cigar
193 that was no longer burning.
194      "What's the matter, Junior, that one a little bit too ripe for your
195 refined taste?"
196      He pulled a cigar out from his shirt pocket and offered it, saying,
197 "Here, this'll wipe that bad taste outta yer mouth real quick."
198      The younger officer rolled his eyes and said, "Thanks anyway,
199 but I'll be just fine as long as I don't have to touch him."
200      "Oh, you don't have to worry about that," the older one replied,
201 "That's Old Hank, and we've got a little agreement with Old Hank there.
202 We don't bother him and he goes about the business of drinking
203 himself into oblivion without being a pain in the ass.  But just you try
204 and take his bottle away or sober him up and BAM!  He turns into a runaway
205 freight train."
206      That's OK with me," the younger officer said, "Now all I have to
207 do is find a way to stay upwind..."
208      Old Hank, as they called him, continued his slow journey down
209 the street, retreating into the comfort of a dark alley close by.  He
210 wasn't always known as Old Hank, however.  Many years before, he
211 had been Henry P> Marsh, married, with a satisfying job in an advertising
212 firm.  Though he enjoyed the challenge of his work and the rapid and
213 easy exchange of ideas with his co-workers, the jewel in the eye of
214 Henry Marsh was his four-year-old daughter, Crystal...

229           A ray of sunlight has been captured in a shard of glass. I stare into
230 my broken pieces which are sadly scattered apon the ground. They're beyond
231 reconstruction, even the gathering of them is useless. I fill my hands with the
232 glistening pain and then let the pieces drop, breaking into a thousand new

239    "Gawd my aching head... What in the hell happened?" It was one Eugene
240 Farley, back, at least for the moment, from the dead.           
241    "Big stick go BOOM! Farley, don't you realize that we were just the object
242 of the affection of a concussion bomb?" Even in pain, Fellows had a knack for
243 wit, ala Sir John Falstaff.
244     Another voice chimed in. "And considering that we are still alive, we
245 must remember to thank our lucky stars. C-Bombs have a nasty rep for getting
246 the job done, and done well." Agent Parity was sitting upright now, his back
247 against what was left of the pawn shop counter.
248     Farley again, dusting himself off, trying to regain some semblance of
249 composure, "Well who would want to blast a crummy pawn shop anyway?"
250     "Not just any old crummy pawn shop Farley, an old crummy NET pawn shop.
251 That makes it special. Also consider the customers."
252     Farley put two and two together, and using the Second Law of Mathematical
253 Induction, came up with four. "Someone doesn't like us being here in San
254 Francisco. I wonder if Kosta or Miss Lamb have anything to do with this
255 attack."
256     Parity, now standing, although still a bit unsteady, motioned the others
257 to the door. "Let's get out of here before the local constables arrive. The
258 last thing I want to do is make my one call to Ian from a San Francisco
259 Bastille!"
260     "Here here old chap." Fellows agreed. "Let us make haste through the
261 proverbial NET back exit. I never leave home without one."
262     "What about our friendly proprietors?" queried Farley. "Shouldn't we check
263 on them?"
264     "No need to. They won't be selling any more hot wedding rings for awhile."
265 Parity pointed to a rather disgusting bloody mess near the opposite end of the
266 counter. "I think the C-Bomb landed right at their feet. But I did get the
267 address we seek before the roof caved in. Let's get out of here."
268     Farley was shocked by Parity's seeming callous attitude regarding the two
269 fallen NET employees. Sure they were probably low grade summer hires, but they
270 were still human. He's covering up. It tears his insides just like it tears
271 the rest of us. But he's hiding it. He can't let it show, on my account.
272 Quick rationalizations had spared more than one NET agent's mind, and Farley
273 knew it.
274     
275     The back exit opened out into an alley behind the building where the pawn
276 shop was located. Old Grateful Dead posters completely covered one wall, and
277 further down the narrow street, a large cement column proudly displayed
278 information for the next concert of the San Francisco Gay Men's Choir. 
279     "Isn't that an odd place for a display like that? I mean in an alley and
280 all." Farley mused.
281     "Remember where you are my boy." smiled Fellows. "The city of a thousand
282 delights, and a thousand oddities"
283   "Yea, you'll have to tell me about the oddities sometime." Farley returned.
284     "Ok enough with the rapier wits. We have some work to do. I suggest we
285 borrow a car from the parking lot across the street. Non-descript, and no
286 chance of bugging. Besides, our assailants probably think we are dead, right?
287 We can use that misconception to our advantage, at least for a while." Parity
288 had no time for joking around. He had far more ominous things on his mind.
289 Kosta, Mary Lamb, the troubles with Ian, watching out for Farley; these were
290 all secondary to the new information that had been slipped in his hand by the
291 man in the pawn shop: A short notation on the back of the address sheet for
292 Mary Lamb, the original reason the agents had come to the shattered pawn
293 shop in the first place. Parity couldn't remember the last time he was so
294 scared. I must not let it show. Not even Fellows can find out. Keep cool
295 Parity, don't lose your head. NET training, help me out!  And then again to
296 the others. "Let's get that car. We have one socialite to visit!" The sounds
297 of distant sirens quicked the trio's pace.
298     
299     Minutes later, the three NET agents sped west along Mission, towards
300 Golden Gate park, and the luxurious home of the Lamb family. Parity drove,
301 partly because he knew the destination (he hadn't revealed the address to the
302 others yet), and partly to calm his mind. The San Francisco traffic was
303 nothing compared to the burden he now carried, alone.

332                      BIG GUZZIS FOR SPORT RIDING
333 
334     Big Guzzis, often reffered to as "guzzlers", have for many years been
335 reveered as the finest motorsport bikes in the universe.   Used mainly at
336 world championship tractor pulls, the guzzlers" literally rip the doors
337 off all competition.
338    In 1923, Italian motorsport racer Mario Lasagna, succesfully defeated
339 some comers at the 1923 "Isle of Pizza" championship.  Mr. Lasagna,
340 sporting his 350cc side valve reverse intake l head hemispherical combustion,
341 stratispherically charged, superbike, (with balogna sliced piston
342 cross section, for reduced friction), finished far ahead of the
343 bicycle contestant, Louise Frogatino, who had retired early due to tire
344 failure on his Schwinn Tourino converted paper route bike.  This race will
345 uncoubtedly fo down in history as one of the finest examples of Italian
346 technial ingenuity.
347      Examples of this far sighted engineering endeaver is revealed in the
348 specially woven wicker basket frame with red tablecloth encapsulated frame
349 lugs.  Another example is the Chianti drip feed evaperation cooling
350 system.  Not only does this reduce the possibility of the fat nodules of
351 the balogna sliced piston from siezing, but it also enables the rider to 
352 slide freely back and forth on the spring mounted salami shaped racing
353 saddle.
354      In modern days the "guzzlers" are often seen snaking down tretcherous
355 mountain passes with rider flagrently sliding from side to side as his
356 Italian weiny machine roars with deep throated salami breath.  Although
357 the Japanese have taken full advantage of the new computer technolegy in
358 designing their machines, the Italians have stayed with the old world
359 ingenuity and fine it much more satisfying to use the old "drink and
360 think" engineering.  This is why we in the rest of the world are still
361 able to enjoy the -----BIG GUZZIES FOR SPORT RIDING.

366 PAM: I'm really glad you enjoyed it.  Now that you mention it, I remember seeing
367 some of your puns on Bit Bucket.  It's always gratifying when one of the old
368 timers (not to mention Goddesses) notices and compliments ones work.  Most of my
369 Joshua entries are filled with references to things which various other people
370 will recognize. (sometimes the quality of the writing suffers because I'm trying
371 so hard to work some subtle reference in).  I had to have the ending because of
372 Ian's predilection for android substitutes.  The middle was aimed at a very
373 small group of people, and the beginning was my chance to have fun with the 
374 overly prudish group apparent here lately.  There were a couple of other hidden
375 references in it, but I can't give them All away.  Anyway, thanks a lot for your
376 comment.  It's always nice to be noticed favorably by one of the biggies.

380 in such a short time span.  I cannot do likewise, however- let me recover
381 from the testing this week.  And finals is NEXT week!  Arrghh...

392   The room is small.  Too small really, the floor almost smothered by the bed
393 and a few stacks of cloths folded neatly next to the closet.  On top of all 
394 this lays various items dropped in an aparent random pattern.  The light on the
395 The light falls on the metal form before it, casting a sickly tinge on the 
396 polished face.  It falls as well on the thick metal fingers, laying motionless
397 on the keyboard.  It is reflected dully by the upturned eyes that stare intent
398 at nothing at all.
399   Behind the eyes though, a battle rages.  Silent screams tear from throats
400 already raw with pain.  Again and again.  Blades covered with the dried blood
401 of endless battle strike flesh.  Over and over.  A nightmare without the hope
402 of waking.
403   Currents flow, positive and negative, light and dark.  An invisible struggle
404 for control, winner take all.  Flow and ebb, thrust and parry.
405   The light proclaims victory, and the darkness only smiles.  The dark seems
406 triumphant, but a small candle light an unseen corner.
407   The light is ordered, and filled with comportable visions of childhood, a
408 movie screen for the past.  The world according to Disney.
409   The dark is fragments and bits.  Promises of the future.  Complete with still
410 photos, hard and graphic.  An appeal to the body.
411 
412   The eyes roll down.  Slowly a hand reaches to the back of the screen and 
413 there is a soft click.
414   
415   The Harlequin is not more.  He was a fool in the game of love, a puppet on
416 strings.  He was afraid.
417   He was afraid of women, and so sought always to be on their side.
418   He was afraid of himself, and so sacrificed himself, seeking peace in empty-
419 ness.
420   He was afraid of the beast, for that was a side of himself he could not bring
421 himself to even recognize.
422   
423   The beast lives.  He is not fool.  He knows this game.  He stands alone.  And
424 he smiles in the darkness of my room.  
425   I invited him.  Sometimes it is that thought that scares me the most.  It has
426 given bastard birth to many a disturbing dream, waking me in the night, covered
427 in sweat, my heart pounding.

443 daily anyway.  I have been incredibly lucky as I have only about 1/2 hour

458      It was more mayhem than I had intended to create, but the function had
459 been performed satisfactorily.  More than satisfactorily, it had killed five
460 men.  I knew that there were always some implements of destruction available
461 in such a covert establishment, and I knew where to find them.  The procedures
462 that were carried out by the dispersal of these weapons had not changed
463 since my departure and subsequent return to 'the proper civilization.'
464      Bending the truth always seemed to be the course of action when walking
465 into such a developed establishment as the pawn shoppe front, but I don't
466 suppose that the people hired to operate it would really know all of what would
467 transpire before them no matter how keen they were.  Suspicious yes, but not
468 really knowledgable.
469      Suspicion is what I aroused when I asked the man behind the counter for
470 the package that coresponded with the claim ticket he had just been handed.
471 The way he kept taking long inspecting glances at me and then the ticket
472 and then back at me again gave me more than a hunch that he knew something was
473 was 'up.'  When he told me that he would have to take a look in the back room
474 for material held longer than a year, I told him I could wait.  He shuffled
475 off behind a few shelves of dusty possessions and confered with his working
476 associate, informing him that I had come for an over-due parcel.  The longer
477 they took in their search for the parcel, the more I knew that they were trying
478 to detain me.  This never happened. NOBODY was ever detained with a ticket that
479 was labeled to the company of "Noodleheimer's Equestrian Troupe".  Never the
480 less, they had to check on it.  I began my search for the nearest weapon 
481 available that would allow me to depart without being followed.  I found the
482 box labled "CONC/B".  It wouldn't be clean, but I would at least have an
483 uninterupted departure.
484      The two men came back to the counter with the ticket and the parcel, and
485 informed me that I would have to sign the usual forms, and pay for the regular
486 deposit on such items when I noticed that the second man was concealing a
487 firearm that he was not carrying when I entered the shoppe.  Things were going
488 to get sticky rather quickly.  Not only did the two men behind the counter
489 take my attention, but there were now three more men walking in the front door.
490 I recognized them, but had no option than to grab for my parcel and escape as
491 rapidly as I could.  I took the parcel and dropped the box on the counter in
492 its place, running fratically for the exit in the rear.  Jumping through the
493 door, the explosion filled my ears as I felt the blast push me into the alley.
494      Dazedly, I made my way through the back streets a long enough distance
495 until I could emerge onto the regular avenues.  I had my parcel, the letters
496 I had been saving since the beginning, and would head off to see their author
497 one more time.  I could not concentrate after doing what I had just done, and
498 called over a cab to take me where I wanted to go.  Collapsed in the back seat,
499 I could not believe I had ended it all for those last three men.  I knew they
500 would be on my trail, but not so quickly.  Was I slowing down?  Did I really
501 do it?  Could it be that I had actually killed my own friend after so long,
502 leaving behind the bodies of L'homme and his companions?  I tryed to relax with
503 the thought that I would be safe for awhile longer, but could not shake the
504 feeling that I was now so alone.
505      Ah, but there would still be my precious Mary...
506      "Oh, do get on with it, driver!"

530 JOSHUA, AFTER AN ABSENCE OF ABOUT A YEAR, I FOUND IT QUITE AN INSULT TO RE-
531 TURN TO THE BACKWATER AND BE INCLUDED IN AN INTRO TO A STORY REFERING IF I
532 MAY QUOTE, "TO THE OVERLY PRUDISH" MEMBERS OF THIS SYSTEM. I SUGGEST YOU RE-
533 FER TO YOUR DICTIONARY FOR A PROPER DEFINITION. IF YOU HAPPENED TO BE AROUND
534 THEN (A YEAR AGO) YOU'LD REALIZE I'M NEITHER. ANYHEY, PLEASE REFRAIN FROM
535 USEING MY NAME.

538 My dear Ms. Dixon: I have indeed been around for substantially more than a year.
539 Following your suggestion, I referenced my dictionary.
540 PRUDE - a person who is overly modest or proper in behaviour, dress, or speech,
541 _esp. in a way that annoys others_.     I used the phrase in exactly the way I
542 meant.  There are many lately who have, in my opinion, fallen in that category.
543 You are not (necessarily) one of them, but as I mentioned to PAM, I like to work
544 many things and people into my stories.  The Deborah in my entry was a very 
545 competent professional, in a non-demeaning profession.  If you choose to 
546 identify yourself with her, and then take offense, that is of course your right.
547 Bear in mind, however, that there are at least 5 people in the world with the
548 same name as you.  At the risk of lessening the humor (or ridicule, depending
549 on your point of view) of my entry, by the time I named names, the point was
550 already made in that part of the entry - misleading the puritans about what
551 was occurring.
552    Remember, too, that as a loyal NET agent, I was not above poking some fun at
553 our Fearless Leader, Ian.  Too many people take what happens on this board too
554 seriously, and get too wrapped up in their personnas.
555   I see that I am again doing what I shouldn't do - stepping outside my 
556 character and attempting to make a statement.  That is not my forte, and I
557 usually blow it.  Let me close with this, Deborah:
558 I respect YOU, and YOUR writing.  I shall, however, continue to have fun at
559 other's expense, if/when the mood strikes me.  I am, after all, not particularly
560 vicious.   (or frequent).                  Until next time.

562 Hey, what's the deal on da? You can't enter anything. It would be great if you
563 couldn't delete other people's stuff, but this sucks.
564 
565 ^^^^^   If the dishes are left for too long, they are ignored altogether.
566 ^^^^^   I almost think that there is no one here to aid me now that I have
567 ^^^^^   taken on the courtesy to visit one in their passtime profession.
568 ^^^^^   The one I come to visit always seems to be somewhere else doing the
569 ^^^^^   cleaning.  These untended tables aren't actually all that bad, but
570 ^^^^^   there are so many of them!  Stacking the plates and returning the
571 ^^^^^   emptied tankards I hear a slightly familiar noise...  I turn to see
572 ^^^^^   the small shape of a feline patting at the window while playfully
573 ^^^^^   filling her time frolicing with the butterfly that is on the other
574 ^^^^^   side.  I return to my work content to listening to the sounds.
575 ^^^^^   Patting and purring...                                        --->G
