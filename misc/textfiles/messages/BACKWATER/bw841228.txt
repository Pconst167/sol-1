20 My very first time to call the Backwater Message System and the 'A' disk is
21 empty. Can there be an omen in this?  (After reading the help file I did make
22 my way to the 'B' disk. VERY interesting)   -----Melissa----
23 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
24   Melissa -- You have, by your own admission, a fantastic case of beginners
25 luck.  At this point it is proper (as you are the first person to make an entry
26 on a blank disk -- lines 1-188 don't count) to performe some type of celebretory
27 action -- dance, sing, or otherwise celebrate the occasion.  
28   My dear, YOU'RE ON TOP!!
29 In honor of this occasion, let's leave the piper and his friend hanging and
30 have a slight pause to honor our new contributor at the top.
31                                                                                 
32 Thank you, one and all.  Now let's see where Peg and the piper got to.
33 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
34   The pegasus' coat was covered with lather and streaked with blood, some of
35 it hers, some the piper's, and most belonging to the winged carnivore.  Several
36 more claw marks striped her heaving flanks with crimson slashes, and only
37 the bent knees of her rider kept him astride her back.  Her wings half-extended,
38 she scanned the surroundings, but saw only a limp, black-striped tawny body
39 twisting in the vagrant air currents.  The evidences of the recent battle were
40 all about, making the air most noisome and difficult to breathhe.
41   Slowly her rider raised himself on her back and spoke.
42   "Peg, we've got to get out of here.  We need food, water, and most of all
43 a chance to rest and heal."
44   The pegasus tossed her head in agreement, adding to the coating of various
45 fluids on her rider's naked chest.  As she did so, the pipes she had been 
46 carrying rattled and bumped the piper's knee.
47   "My pipes!" the piper excamed.  "Peg, I never noticed, I was so glad to see
48 you --  and then quite a bit too busy."
49   Reaching forward, the piper slid the cord over the pegasus' head and removed
50 his pipes from her neck.  Checking them over and finding them intact, he 
51 placed the pipes under his arm, let the drones hang free (lack of gravity 
52 does pose a problem here), and grasped the chanter.  A few lungfuls of air
53 inflated the leather bag, and with a few trial runs on the scales, the piper
54 began the piobreachd "The Desperate Battle."  As he played the ground, or 
55 theme of the tune, the gold and black of the surrounding celestial sphere 
56 began to take on a shimmering, unreal hue, progressing as the tune progressed.
57   Somewhere in the twists and turns of possible realities, one can find nearly
58 any situation one might imagine.  People go through lives of quiet desperation,
59 noisy exultation, and most other variations that can occur.  Persons live, die
60 rot, or resurrect.  They found religions, and logically disprove them, but a
61 near universal human trait is a love of comfort.  Different cultures have 
62 differing ideas of comfort, but many find proximity to a seaside soothing.
63 Add to this a warm sunshine, a very light breeze, and a near blood-temperature
64 warmth, and the sight of a young lady laying near a striped tent pitched on
65 the seashore takes on a near-mythic quality.  Even the ranks of heavily-armed
66 guardsmen surrounding the area did little to dispell the feeling of languidity
67 that hung over the beachfront scene -- soft and lazy as a summer afternoon.
68   The young woman raised her head in puzzlement -- then shook her head.
69 Her guardsmen shifted nervously, a strange quality was in the air.  A deep
70 straining in the fabric of reality seemed to manifest itself in a nearly 
71 inaudible sound that was coming "closer" every second.  It was unexpected,
72 but not surprising to the armed party that surrounded it, when the sound 
73 became audible from withing the gold and black striped beach tent.  It was 
74 with no surprise that the young lady directed her guards to surround the tent,
75 and only a slight arch of her lovely eyebrows indicated her amazement as
76 the badly wounded and blood-stained pegasus, wings folded tightly to her body
77 stepped out of the beach tent.  Another slight quirk of her lips betrayed 
78 some knowlege of the rider, equally as damaged as his mount, naked to the waist,
79 covered by blood and claw marks, kilt hiked high up his thighs, clutching his
80 quaint instrument, still sporting a small cap with a feather at a jaunty angle.
81 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

87 "Stop that--it's getting too silly!!" - The Colonel
88 
89       Let's see if I have this straight...the NET is looking for Joshua near
90 the Dangerfield (?) Hotel, Farley (who isn't NET - an enemy?) was following 
91 someone, but lost them and went home for Christmas, Petrov is an enemy of
92 the NET (where is he?), the Piper (the pipes have turned out to be bagpipes-
93 I didn't know that before) has warped onto a lady's beach for some R&R, and 
94 the Inn has become unusually quiet. (Those disputing that last fact, please 
95 remember that I joined the Inn when it was composed of fantasy travellers,
96 so the Bond-type stuff caught me off guard.)  This is terribly confusing to
97 some poor character in search of a story who is trying to fit it all into 
98 one coherent universe.  I think I'll just give up on that and enjoy the stories
99 for what they are -- great stories.  If the Cistop ever needs any extra money
100 (and he has the authors' permission) he could get rich publishing this stuff-
101 in the great tradition of the THEIVE'S WORLD anthologies.
102 
103 		THAT REMINDS ME------
104        For those of you that don't know yet, the 6th THEIVES WORLD
105        book is out!!  It's called WINGS OF OMEN, and our favorite
106        bad guys battle the invaders.  Good stuff!!!
107        (Just repaying the guy that told me about Adams latest...)
108 
109 Anyway,just keep on writing, and I hope to see a couple of you at the PorSFiS
110 meeting tomorrow!!  Look for the long orange scarf...

157                                                       Glass
158  
159     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
160  
161         A piece of glass is fitted into the bottom of the stopper for the
162     flask. To that is placed an eight-inch length of rubber tubing and at
163     the end of this is the aerator. Two more pieces of glass is put in the
164     top of the stopper.
165  
166         First, you will need pure alcohol so buy some 100 proof vodka and
167     distill it until you have about 12 oz.
168  
169         Put the alcohol in the flask.Put about two inches of bleach and a
170     teaspoon of Sani-Flush in the chlorine bottle. This will generate the
171     clorine gas that you will need. Start the clorine through the alcohol
172     while the flask is still cold. Watch it carefully to see when the
173     alcohol stops absorbing the clorine. Then light a alcohol lamp and
174     place it under the 600 ml flask. Keep the flame low until the alcohol
175     stops absorbing again. Raise the flame and repeat. Continue this untill
176     the alcohol is boiling. Some of the alcohol will distill off into the
177     collection bottle. Several times during the process, pour this back
178     into the 600 ml beaker.
179  
180         When the alcohol is totally chlorinated the flask is poured into a
181     porcelain dish and allowed to cool. If you have done this right the
182     cooled product should be a crystaline mass of unrefined Cloral Hydrate.
183  
184         Now, pour strong sulfuric acid, three times the volume of the
185     Cloral Hydrate, into the pan. Place this pan on your stove over gentle
186     heat. When the cloral hydrate is melted, it and the sulfuric acid are
187     stirred throughly pour this into the flask and heat again. But this
188     time use the thermometer and don't let it get over 200 F.
189  
190         As the mixture heats up, the still impure cloral hydrate will rise
191     to the surface. When it stops rising, use the basting syringe and draw
192     the top off of the sulfuric acid. Repeat this until the pan is empty.
193  
194         Put the cloral hydrate (you drew it off in the last step) into the
195     beaker and heat at about 190 F. for 20 minutes. This will get rid of
196     any alcohol or acid still in it. Pour this back into the flask and add
197     an equal amount of sulfuric acid. Swirl this around to mix it.
198  
199         Once again you must distill the mixture. But this time it is easy
200     since the cloral hydrate will boil at 210 F and the sulfuric acid boils
201     at 722 F. When finished pour out the acid, then wash and dry the flask.
202     Now, put the powered Calcium Oxide, equal in volume to the cloral
203     hydrate into the flask, add the cloral hydrate and distill again. Stop
204     as soon as the surface of the oxide is dry.
205  
206  
207         To use, add one part water to two parts { by volume } of the
208     finished product. The dose is 1/28th of an oz ( 1 gram ). The best way
209     to use this is to put it into a mixed drink, because it has a bitter
210     taste. In about 15 minutes, whoever you gave it to is out for the
211     night.

248 ###########################################################################
249      The Innkeeper sat slumped on an old broken crate in back of the Inn.  
250 A small pile of pebbles lay at his side.  Heavy dark clouds lay close about 
251 the Inn, but the Innkeeper was totally oblivious to the drizel being 
252 omitted by them.  The rain had turned the dirt floored court into a maze of 
253 mud puddles and muck.  Nearby, one of the puddles exploded with a plop as 
254 the Innkeeper tossed a pebble into it.  He watched the waves rush back and 
255 forth within its narrowly defined borders, erasing and recreating its small 
256 mud beaches.  Slowly the waves subsided until once again it was quiet save 
257 for the small ripples of the pattering rain...   Once again the puddle 
258 explodes as yet another pebble joins its brother in that wet embrace, and 
259 again the puddles tiny world is shattered by this intruder.
260      The Innkeeper sometimes came here to get away from the noise of the 
261 Inn and the pressing crowd.  He could still hear the muffled echos of the 
262 patrons shouts and gufaws.  Instead of enjoying the revelry within, he was 
263 saddened and morose, for one voice was missing in the din.  His barmaid and 
264 friend Pam was nowhere to be found.  These disappearances had been getting 
265 more frequent and longer as the year progressed, until now he felt himself 
266 lucky to even hear of her presence second hand.  And to have her even 
267 notice him anymore, why... It was hard to even imagine that anymore. 
268      Ah, Pam what has happened to diminish your interest in the Inn?  Is it 
269 me, are my demands too strong for you to deal with?  Has the enchantment of 
270 the Inn deteriorated so much?  Once you had been so cheerful, hardly being 
271 able to wait for the next work shift so that you could once more immerse 
272 yourself in the joys of the Inn.  But, now, the cheerfulness and vigor are 
273 gone, and instead when you do appear, it is as if with a forced smile and a 
274 false mask of joy.  It is as if it were no longer a thing of love but 
275 rather a duty one forces upon themself even though they would rather be 
276 doing something else.  
277      I know I can be quarrelious at times, and the Inn's patrons can be a 
278 bit obnoxious, but surely this has not been enough to dim your joyous 
279 spirit.  Ach, it hurts to see a friend drift away, to loose interest in 
280 enjoyments once shared.  No longer laughing, no longer gleefully makeing 
281 the rounds of the Inn, checking up on the well being of the furniture and 
282 the patrons themselves.  No longer do I see that joyous bounce in your step 
283 as you move to clean a table left by an overly imbibed customer.  Instead 
284 it is replaced with a downcast mood of weariness, as if you would rather be 
285 elsewhere, but forced yourself to the task after being unable to find even 
286 a meager excuse to avoid your self imposed duty.
287      Dear friend, is there something I can do (or not do) to change this? 
288 Hopefully to reverse it?  But perhaps I ask too much.  Your interests 
289 have probably moved on to other and better things, and I certainly have no 
290 right to ask you to revert to older ways.  You certainly have much better 
291 things to do then waste your time in this broken down hovel.  It is only 
292 that it hurts to see a friend drift away.
293 
294      Change, the one thing that cannot be stopped.  Sometimes it moves in 
295 the direction you would like, and other times it doesn't...  Having 
296 rehersed his speech, the Innkeeper went over it again, seeing it was a bit 
297 rough around the edges, but he knew it was the best he could do for now.  
298 The only problem was when would he see Pam again to present it to her?  He 
299 never knew when she might appear again, or for that matter if she would at 
300 all anymore.  Heaving a sigh, the Innkeeper slumped against the rear wall 
301 of the Inn and watched the rain attempting to turn the rear court of the 
302 Inn to a muddy swamp.  In the distance the mornful cry of a wolf could be 
303 heard, echoing across the court its distaste for the sodden weather.
304 
305      The Innkeeper threw the remaining stones into the puddle causing a 
306 cascade of water to fly in all directions, leaving a puddle only half its 
307 original size with a new island of rock in the middle.  Getting up off of 
308 the old crate, he slogged back in the rear door of the Inn not even 
309 bothering to clean his shoes of the clinging clay.  The rear door closed 
310 quietly leaving the puddle in peace once more, and the dark clouds worked 
311 earnestly to once more fill it to its old size.

315 GAD! I've been trying to call in all day and only now just got
316 through. Maybe that's why Pam hasn't called? As it was, I only 
317 got though because I was finaly able to put my modem on autodial
318 and had it camp on the line until it could get through. (It's
319 after 5PM) Off hand, I'd say the Inn is getting just a bit busy

352 Mr. Mckane: Some members of the NET want it to be a closed corporation, 
353 others want to open it to anything that crawls in off the street. I
354 Ppersonally, would prefer that people who want to be on OUR side at
355 would at least check to make sure that they aren't tromping all over
356 someone's carefully planned plot.
357 	We have had too many instances of this sort of thing. Now, 
358 mind you, I tend to rather EXPECT this from the opposition. But from
359 our FRIENDS?
360 	This is why we are attempting to get some sort of handle on the
361 situation. I am *FAR* more tolerant of this sort of thing than my 
362 colleagues. This is one of the items on the agenda for our meeting
363 tomorrow. 
364 	One final note, while we try to interfere with you as a matter 
365 of course, (and vice-versa) WE do not try to dictate internal policy to
366 you. (and at least WE have better taste than to employ PETROV!)

370 Ian: Certainly doing your homework now, aren't you?  Alas, as I have said, I must work tomorrow.  Must help the boss
371 get the bills out.  I don't frequent any BBS's other than dear BW anymore, but just tell me which one to use and I'll
372 oblige (CBBS/PCS, private?).

374 I made the dinner a quick one.  My mother was very unhappy I had to go, but understood.  I could barely contain myself
375 as I quickly strode out to Fred.
376 "Here it is, Fred.  Work on it."  I hoped I could get results, soon.
377 "Scanning pages... code read.  Decipherment process begun.  Who did you get this from, Farley?", Fred asked.
378 "I, er, ah, well...got it from Santa.  Don't worry about the details.  I'm beginning to think I'm going slowly nuts."
379 "First code: deciphered.  The last entry tells that NET is planning to change their code, that there are too many 
380 leaks.  I have not deciphered subsequent blocks of code."
381 "What are the words, exactly?"
382 "They're not important.  The rest of it just says 'This is my last entry in the old code.'"
383 "Well, any references to places in the rest of the text you've deciphered?"
384 "Yes... But I think I've made an error.  Either that, or Joshua did.  A group of letters here and there translate to
385 'PORSFIS'.  Meaningless garbage."
386 "PORSFIS?  Stop on the rest of the translation for a moment.  Scan data files in the City of Portland offices for
387 PORSFIS.  Maybe it's something local."
388 "Wait, you're right.  Portland Science Fiction Society.  PorSFiS.  They're having a meeting on the 29th.  Tomorrow."
389 "Let's get there.  Where is it?  I want to have the room they meet in bugged.  We'll wait a few blocks away."
390 "The Multnomah County Library, Main Branch.  10th and Taylor.  Conference room A."
391 "Hey, 10th and Taylor.  The address Joshua was seen at?"
392 "Yes.  We can stay at the Hilton, a few blocks from there."
393 "Let's go.  This may get interesting, and we just MIGHT get a substantial clue for a change."

396 UNDERGROUND.
397 We've existed for nearly four years.  Started out as another one of Reagan's crackpot ideas.
398 Fortunately, we were under better management.  Me.
399 Our purpose: to keep the public ignorant, help in our small way to begin small wars, and to keep our national debt down.
400 All deporable tasks, but we enjoy them.  Some may say we're doing impossible missions.  No, just damn hard ones.
401 We're UNDERGROUND: UNion to Destroy Essential Records, Global Rationality, and Our Ubiquitous National Debt.
402 Destroying records is easy.  Valuable, too.  Of course, we copy them first.  It's better to be well informed, 
403 especially if you destroy everyone else's information.
404 We profit by selling arms to both sides of small skirmishes.  Thus we put an end to Global Rationality.
405 Our third purpose is what ties us to the government still.  If not for that, we would have never learned of our enemies,
406 the NET.
407 They asked for $200 millon from the government, and got it.  That's contributing a lot to our National Debt.
408 Thus, secretly, we have gathered information on this group.  Recently, one of their agents was presumed lost.  Just a 
409 few days ago, evidence turned up that suggests he still lives.  If he does, within his mind is sufficient information
410 to destroy the NET so that the $200 mil can be used for better purposes.  Us.
411 We want that information.  Unlike the NET, we don't hesitate to use force.  Most of our agents like it.  Some even call
412 the killing a 'fringe benefit'.
413 Our agents have been sent to the Portland, OR. area in search of this missing NET agent.  The ironic part is that they
414 posed as NET agents and some idiot believed them.  They sent him out on a 'mission'.
415 Since then, the agents have been reprimanded and we have relocated.  The site is now free of any evidence.  We can only
416 hope that the NET does not gain possession of the false ID card given to the idiot sent out.
417 By mistake, an ID card containing vital UNDERGROUND internal information was given to this man.  Since the punishment
418 dealt out to the two agents was death, no discription is available.  The executors of the agents have also been 
419 terminated.
420 All UNDERGROUND agents: You have now been briefed.  Your goals are: find the NET agent, and find the man with the ID 
421 card.  Both are believed to still be in the Portland area.
422 Failures in this manner will lead to the customary penalty.
423                 John K. O'Hara
424 Addenda: Tested models of the XD-40 will be issued as standard weaponry for this task, from the Government's labs.
425 The last of the FD-78 models has been sold just prior to intelligence learning of the NET.  KF-01's will be issued in
426 their stead.

431 
432   tilean wrapped his finger s around the glass, warmth fogged the sides from his wet hands. steam poured out from
433 inside the bathroom. the lights were on dim, a small warbling sound came from his desk.
434 
435   walking slowly over to the phone, tilean reached into his robe pocket and pulled forth the ring. tilean answered
436 the phone.
437   "mthe mckinlay papers have been deciphered, sir. the text file is in your terminal waiting for you. and, about
438 the anderson papers,nearing completion. i think that's it."
439   "it should be, you're right... i do remember a doctor kyle lloyd... an induction problem ?" said tilean.
440 
441   "i know a little about the situation, a doctor kyle lloyd, inducted into a low level security position. i think
442 he spooked..." the leiutenant seemed worried to mention traitors, fearing his life.
443 
444   "yes, spooked is the precise wording, it seems he started reading the london times and decided that Thrike was a
445 threat to his national security. i see no reason to have him assasinated though,  i met him once, seemed to be an
446 extraordinary man, i like him."
447 
448  "i beleive i am due for a call from him soon, thank you for the report, see you soon..." tilean turned of the
449 microphone, and put the ring on his finger.
450   # nice boy, , him...  i will remember to speak to his officer... when shall lloyd call... eight this evening...
451 good... # tilean was tired, it showed  on his droopy eyelids...
452 
453   after a small minute looking over the mckinlay papers, the warbler sounded again... lloyd was calling... lloyd
454 was late... five minutes...
455   "sorry for being so late, i was held up at the lab, we  have a net agent here, asking about the joshua affair."
456   "please, calm yourself, no need to worry, i'm kind of bored here anyway..." lloyd was n't excited... definately
457 not excited enough to warrant the rebuff tilean had given him... "i hear you want to phase out of Thrike...?"
458 
459   "well, all i was thinking was of transferring out of this net assignment. somewhere where the lizards don't
460 prowl during the night. i was thinking about an assignment in oregon..." tilean cut him off.
461   "an assignment in oreg... oh. i will arrange the net transfer in the morning, alright ?" tilean tried to sound
462 menacing... tilean didn't know how he did... sounding menacing was never his best trait...
463 
464   "well, i was also thinking of a leave of absense... a vacation, i am starting to think in the language of our
465 computer system here." lloyd had a slight tone of worry... only tilean might have noticed it.
466 
467   "i understand, but usually when people take leave's of absense they try not to come back... then net or someone
468 grabs them and we never hear from them again." tilean sounded nice... kind.
469   "i see in the newspapers that net is reforming, at least the originals are, anyway..." lloyd was changing the
470 subject as best he could in the situation...
471   "the originals are... to an extent... right now they are simply doing nothing but talk..." tilean lied.
472 
473   "the morals and foundations are being questioned by some of the newer members... internal dissarray... never a
474 nice thing to have... anyway... possibly they will come out of all of this with a new sense of purpose." said
475 tilean, softly, insinuating something, lloyd wasn't sure what though.
476 
477   "i see... they seem to wrapped up in interfering with trade and commerce to be doing much else anyway."
478   "no... some of them are involved in selling arms to the farmers in cambodia... to protect themselves from the a
479 arms that the net is selling to the vietnamese... weapons and more weapons... will it never end ? " tilean so
480 sounded quite idealistic... at times tilean got that way... at others...
481   "i never unerstood those agencies... the cia, the kgb, net... all of them bent on edominating the world, and if
482 they couldn't... no one else could... stupid, and arrogant..." tilean was silent, listening to lloyd recount
483 the thrike ideals... lloyd continued... "why are they so rigid ? why do they want to destroy the Earth ? "
484 
485   tilean saw why lloyd entered thrike, an idealist, someone to whom life was more sacred than the ideals therin...
486   a kindred spirit, thought tilean. tilean spoke... interrupting lloyd... "i do not know, destroying the world i
487 nothing new, they have founded no major ideals with what they do... all they manage is to proclaim the righteous
488 path, and then order everyone to follow it... caring not that all cultures have differing ideals... paying no 
489 attention to the rights of everyone to decide for themselves.. all thrike is formed to do, is acheive a single
490 earth government... to controll all these petty squables that have gone on for so many centuries..." tilean was 
491 an idealist too.
492   "so many centuries, think of the redundancies of it all..." lloyd finished tilean's sililoquy... lloyd
493 reminded of the principles for which he entered thrike... the principles thrike was to defend... lloyd was still
494 oyal to his path... in his own way, a follower of the righteous path...

506 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (a small word of warning)
507 Ian;     Although not formally introduced yet I would like to remind you of 
508      something that has been pointed out to me elsewhere.     I know that
509      all of the current hub-bub and semi-confused plot connections may
510      require that you take vigil over the flock which on ocassion requires
511      that you stand out from the background.  This does seem helpful but may 
512      may be putting yourself into a situation of the compromise of your safety.
513      (I know, you can handle yourdelf, your on top)  My words are these:
514                   Familiarity  Breads  Contempt   (spellings?)
515      I hope you understand my friendly message-     Mums the word...

518 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
519   Somehow, being at the top engenders the ambition to put forth a major effort
520 in writing things.  Being so near the bottom has the opposite effect.  We'll
521 leave Peg and the piper in their fix for a while (after all, it's their own
522 fault -- I didn't put them there!).
523   PorSFiS folks -- no promises, but circumstances have changed.  I may be able
524 to meet you there today, or after at the customary oasis.
525 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
526 ========================================================================
527 Let me see if I understand the rules the NET is run by. The Net is a 
528 story that is run by a committee. Only members of the committee are 
529 allowed to contribute and they must conform to the story line of the 
530 group. Non-NET members can join the story if they remain enemies of the
531 NET and don't change the plot decided by the committee.
532     It must be very difficult to be creative while conforming to the 
533 group. I guess that's probably why the NET adventure has been so disjointed
534 and difficult to follow. I'm glad you guys are having so much fun 
535 but I really wonder if a committee can ever write a story worth reading.

540 Prometheus: Actualy, you shouldn't rush to judge so fast.
541 LINK-UP is most definately NOT a twit magazine. It is a well respected
542 glossy magazine that is nationally distributed. It is oriented towards
543 microcomputer telecommunications. The reference that was made, is that
544 it has a monthly reveiw of BBS's in the back (about a paragraph per
545 system) and BWMS was one of the systems reveiwed in the DEC 84 issue.
546 Not having a copy handy, it went something like; 'This system is a little
547 different then most. When you call in all you get is a > prompt. Type
548 HELP or LIST to see what it is all about. Try it you'll like it!'
549 As for the Slashman/knockout drops/link up inquiry, don't  be so quick
550 to assume they are all the same person. (I have no reason to assume they
551 are mind you) Note that the knock out drops article was very well written
552 as opposed to the Slashman entry. From the structure, I'd say it was stolen
553 from somewhere else. By the way, it is definately NOT what would appear
554 in Link up. Linkup talks about communications equipment and software, not
555 things like that. Another mag oriented to telecomm, is Microcommunications.
556 There is also one oriented to BBS's called Entry. And I remember hearing
557 of one about a year ago called PLUMB that was also oriented to BBS's, but
558 I don't know if it is still alive.

560 ::::::::::O O::::::::::12:30:::::::::::::::12/29:::::::::::O O:::::::::::
561 Hemmingway: the NET stories are not written by committee.  Every entry is
562 relatively independant.  The authors talk together every now and then
563 (usually at PorSFiS/PCS), where a DIRECTION is suggested.  Guidelines have been
564 set down, but they are VERY broad. (such as - don't manipulate someone elses
565 character unnecessarily  i.e put too many words in their mouth.  You can capture them,
566 torture them, but don't play them.)  The fun is derived from finding out what
567 the other people are going to do, and how it affects you.  For instance :
568 Farley was interacting with some people in a deserted lot.  He probably
569 intended that they were NET agents.  Someone else suggested that they may
570 have been frauds.  This left it up to Farley to decide which way to go.
571 Another player then decided that they WERE fakes, and Farley had to play it
572 in that direction, OR FIGURE OUT A CLEVER WAY TO REDIRECT THE STORY.
573 That, as I see it, is where a large part of the enjoyment comes from.
574 The people who are playing the NET have certain ideas in common, certain ways
575 they like things to go.  Understandings, if you will.  This is why they are
576 so protective of their corporate identity.
577 One more comment - Several genre exist on BackWater.  Fantasy, spy (NET) stories,
578 discussions/arguments, and combinations.  The NET stories are ideally played with
579 a James Bond flair - no magic, no super high-tech weapons.  Like the Bond
580 stories, situations are preferably resolved by wits and normal weapons, although
581 limited super-gadgets are permitted (Farley's car, and L'homme's before that).
582 One thing that is extremely irritating is, after setting up an interesting
583 predicament for a character, requiring an ingenious solution, someone comes in
584 and 'cuts the Gordian Knot' - resolves the situation by operating outside the
585 framework of the reality. (commonly referred to as a 'deus ex machina'. 
586 Sorry, Ian.  Sometimes it works, but sometimes.....)
587 Enough on that.
588 Farley: Yes, I can run off a copy of the Nuclear Risk rules.  Should I give them to 
589 L'homme to give to you?  I would mail it, but I cannot find you in the phone book.
590 (nothing in your Eastern locale, one in SW, two in LkOs).
591 {heh heh.. nothing is safe from the NET.  You hated the 80 columns, didn't you...}
592 Alex: sorry I missed the game. It's been too long since last we played.
593 Having become an employed person seems to have cut into my time and energy.
594 Petrov is here until the 6th; he'd still like to pay you back for Europe.
595 Maybe we can schedule one game in before then?
596 ......
597 I'll be glad when school starts up again.  It's extremely difficult to get 
598 on BackWater lately.  All those new modems, I guess.  Friday morning at 08:15
599 there were 5 lines on this disk, now, 28 hours later, it's almost full?  Sheesh..
