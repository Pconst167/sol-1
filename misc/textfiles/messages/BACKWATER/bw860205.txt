30    Rejek closed the door quietly. He moved over to sit at the table in the dimly lit room. Seated next to him was Reez
31 and Weritt. Across the table sat James and Tariya, who looked at them impatiently. There had been enough confusion
32 here. It was time for some answers. James spoke first. "You kept calling us outsiders, and said there was a war going
33 on. Give me some details."
34    Weritt looked down at his folded hands. "Shai-Kahn has seceded from the government council." Tariya gasped and he
35 nodded knowingly. "Twenty one days ago the five surrounding provinces declared war. And they are recieving support
36 from the rest. Cut off from all trade lines, we are in a state of siege. In fact, Harad-Jchal to the north and Xenis
37 to the south have penetrated so deeply into our territory that the province is in danger of being split in half,
38 should the fronts meet. The civilian casualties are incredible and growing worse. Our military might is down forty
39 percent according to rumor. We can't last much longer." he was silent.
40    Tariya was pale and shaking. James reached under the table and took her hand, which she grasped gratefully. He
41 said, "So we have one helluva war going on. I don't understand why."
42    "For the last four centuries all provinces have been united. Since each can supply goods and services that none of
43 the others can't, it's necessary for survival. Sometimes one of the rulers gets the idea that he or she can rule the
44 planet better than the council. When this happens the remaining provinces immediately act to put down the
45 insurrection. The result is always a short but bloody war that always defeats the rebel province and replaces the
46 royal family with anothr family that is more sympathetic to the council's goals."
47    Quietly, Tariya continued, "And the entire deposed family is... put to death in a public execution."
48    Reez bellowed, "And rightly so! That BITCH is destroying our country and killing our people for no good
49 reason!"
50    Tariya jumped up and almost sprang across the table at him. "Shut up! Shut up! If my mother started this then she
51 had a damn good reason! I know she did! I don't ever want to hear... hear..." James had had to bodily keep her away
52 from Reez. She finally quit trying and collapsed in his arms, crying softly.
53    Holding her tightly, he glared at Reez, who was backed up against a far wall. "Open your God damned mouth one more
54 time," He growled dangerously, "and I'll close it permanently."
55    Tariya finally calmed down and James diplomatically suggested she wait outside. This was obviously too hard on her
56 (which he could understand. After all, he had seen his own world laid waste). Swallowing hard, she agreed and after
57 leaving James sat back down. "Okay, now tell me where I'm supposed to come into this."
58    Weritt laid a large, hardbound volume down on the table. James took one look at it and groaned. It was the book he
59 had written about his first adventure. "These are contraband, the book and owner to be destroyed on discovery. The
60 story told here is known to be true and does not set well with the council. You are a wanderer, walking power without
61 limit. Many fear you, including the council. The queen has hatched some plot to use you to destroy the council. Doing
62 that would surely plunge our planet into an anarchic dark age. It is beyond out wildest dreams that you turned up
63 here, not allied with the queen. We hope to persuade you-"
64    Reez spoke up despite James' warning, "We have no money. We hope to appeal to your sense of justice, to your
65 sympathy. She is destroying us-"
66    Rejek threw in, "My son had a modified T-47 flyer. He is experienced enough that he can transport you safely
67 through the battle zone to Shaikhur-"
68    James slammed his palms down on the table. "QUIET! What are you asking me to do?"
69    Rejek said quietly, "She commands the forces directly. Without her orders, surrender and peace would come quickly.
70 It's our only hope." He looked down at his hands for a long moment. This wasn't an easy thing to say. "We want you to
71 assassinate Marannon Qoasis xennon-Silmarilyn."

73 <yawn> Did anyone catch the Never Ending Story?

75      Bard finished his notes, "Atmosphere is various nitrogen oxides,
76 apparently due to a micro-organism that developed the ability to metabolize
77 atmospheric nitrogen and oxgen and excrete the resultant nitric acid as a
78 waste product. Naturally this eliminated competing organisms."
79      "Only apparent use for this line is as a source of nitrates, or as a
80 site for high pollution industries".
81      Survey work on oddball timelines was boring *and* dangerous. But at 
82 least it paid the bills. And it beat fighting unpleasant strangers. 
83      He checked his gear and set the conveyor for the next line on the list
84 he'd been issued. Hmmm, chlorine AND oxgen. Wonderful....
85      He checked to make sure the shift had gone properly. He was about to
86 place the board on standby when the flux readings jumped. As he ran a check
87 they jumped again. Hmm, both appeared to be non-techno shifts of around 100
88 kilos. Probably some journeyman magician without sense enough to use the 
89 shift spell to grab a sample *before* visiting a new plane. Or it could a
90 a chlorine breather, but they usually massed more. Well, he go check it out
91 (damn! ch /he/he'd/ & add a period)
92     He checked his hood seals and the rescue ball while the lock cycled. As
93 he left he kept thinking that there was something familiar about one of
94 those readings. At least they were close by...
95      As soon as he was outside he heard it.... a bagpipe dying away.

107 When the darkness subsided the two imposters were gone.  I looked over to
108 see the old man but he too had gone.  All that remained of him was the trailings
109 of a blueish aura and a blank piece of paper laying on the table.  Going over to
110 study it closer I saw that it was bit chared around the edges but blank all the
111 same.  It must have been a page from his spell book.  I was so involved in my
112 own spell that I never noticed what he was doing.  I collected up the page and
113 went back over to my place by the fire and grabbed a sip of ale.  In the fire 
114 I could see a small twig that had just started to burn.  I quickly pulled it
115 out of the fire and found that I had myself a fine charcoal quill.  Now I finally
116 had the chance to put one of my drawings on paper.

120   It's rather unpleasant to find yourself grabbed unexpectedly.  It's even
121 more unpleasant to find yourself grabbed so tightly that you can't catch your 
122 breath.  It pushes the unpleasentness index up another notch if there is not
123 even a breath to catch, your eyes are burning, and your ribs feel as if 
124 something is trying to fuse them together with its grip.  Up goes the index
125 still another point if you are lifted off the ground and dangled in an inver-
126 ted position.  But perhaps the acme of unpleasantness is reached if your 
127 streaming eyes catch a blurred glimpse of a slavering maw opening to recieve
128 you like a baseball fan stuffing in a mustard-covered hot dog.
129   The piper's hold on conciousness was rather tenuous when the creature that
130 had captured him invited him to dinner -- as the main course.  He did not 
131 even notice the warm foetid air rushing around him as he was stuffed 
132 unceremoniously into the creature's gullet, although he noticed the stench
133 when the rhythmic motions of peristaltis allowed him to catch a fragmentary
134 breath.  Somehow he was no longer tightly gripped, although he was in a
135 small, dark tunnel, choking on the bile raised by the smell.  The noxious
136 gas was absent here (although he was already wondering if it wouldn't be
137 better to go outside to die).
138   Umphh.  No, too small.  He couln't turn around.  He had no intention of
139 crawling further down the tunnel, it seemed too much like the creature's 
140 gut.  Dinner he might be, but unwilling he would remain.
141   The piper lay in the sticky warmth for a few moments, trying to regain his
142 strength and make a plan for his escape.  He suspected that he had moved too
143 hastily in leaving the inn without enlisting help.  He suspected that if
144 any of the patrons followed, they might find themselves quite literally
145 in the soup -- or perhaps more to the point the local creatures might be
146 in for a banquet of the size they had not seen for a long time.
147   Alarmed by the depressing thoughts that pressed in on him, the piper
148 sought for a way to raise his spirits.  If only the bard were here, he'd
149 have an appropriate song for the occasion.  A song -- if the bard were
150 here, he'd appreciate the song that the piper had picked up a few months
151 back from a drunken irishman.  Half hysterically, the piper hummed the
152 tune, then in a quavering voice began to sing:
153 		A quiet home had parson Gray,
154 		Secluded in a vale,
155 		His daughters all wer feminine,
156 		And all his sons were male.
157 
158 		'Gainst all the vices of the age,
159 		He manfully did battle,
160 		His chickens were a biped breed,
161 		And quadruped, his cattle.

185     Staring over into the flames of the fire within the hearth, I felt that
186 it was time to go.  Strange things had happened here, acts that were beyond
187 the ken of my lot...  I am merely an entertainer, not a wise man.
188     Slightly confused, I looked back down at the table where Ripple and I
189 had located ourselves to pour some more of the fine ale into her smallish
190 mug.
191     "What do you think of what has just happened here?  It's a...  Ripple,
192 Where did you go off to now?  Ripple?"
193     "Oh, I'm over here, by the fire."
194     "Never stay in one place for long, do you?  I was going to comment that
195 this would be a good time to slip out.  Events like green-yellow smoke
196 taking away people whole and all these dazzling lights...  Well, it's not
197 the sort of thing that is commonplace here."
198     "At least now I have some paper to use for a drawing!  Look, I've
199 started working on what you've called 'Herm-'"
200     "No, I think we should be going and give the Inn a rest," I said paying
201 little heed to her words.
202     "Well, may I at least finish my mug?"
203     "Um, yes, of course.  Just a moment."  I fetched our beverages.  While
204 doing this, Ripple took the paper and after carefully rolling it placed it
205 with her other belongings, pouch by her side.
206     "One for the road," she said as she raised her mug.
207     "Here's hoping things will return to normal.  Cheers."
208     "Well, better enjoy the fire while we are able.  Spirits may warm the
209 body and dull the mind, but it still is going to be cold outside."
210     "*That* is no ordinary fire," I said.  She thought nothing of it and
211 continued to drink.
212     
213     We were soon to be on our way, away from the Inn.  A pity we had only
214 just arrived when all sorts of strangeness would happen.  Then again, the
215 Inn usually did attract excitement when least expected.  And little did I
216 know of where I was to go, the magic Ripple now possessed, or the people I
217 would cross.

228    The sun had dropped to near the horizon, as it described it's low arc across the western sky. In the distance
229 a cloud of smoke hung in the air, the last trace of the destroyed Albatross. The rain that had been falling was turning
230 to sleet, and in a few hours, the runway would be covered with ice.
231    The wind had picked up, and whistled thru the cavernous hangar. Small puddles collected in the corners.
232 There were three aircraft inside; a WWII vintage F4-U Corsair, a classic stagger-wing Beech, and a tired but
233 airworthy Dakota, painted in camouflage shades. The old Boeing had had an interesting and eventful life, and quite
234 {befitting of her colorful history, she was about to become famous.
235 
236    Inside the workshop, the six men were sitting about the room, on folding chairs that the mechanic had provided.
237 A case of Budweiser had been brought from the store room, and on a hotplate, a kettle of stew simmered, filling
238 the room with a tantalizing aroma. 
239    Delta Five stood up, and cracked open another can of Bud, and addressed the group.
240 "Okay, gentlemen, we all know each other, but there are a lot of missing pieces. What say we fill the gaps."
241 "All hell is about to break loose. The printout Lou has shown us tells it all. The Navy doesn't take kindly to losing
242 one of it's carriers. Things are gonna start happening, and damn quick, too."
243 The barrel chested man drained the can he was holding, and walked to the frij, talking as he moved"
244 I came here to join up with Mssrs. Parity and Fellows against a common enemy. " George. you and Lou
245 are obviously old buddies, and your being here has something to do with McKane. Suppose you elaborate...."
246    George Kellerman stood up to talk as Delta passed out cans of Bud. He was a tall, broadshoulder man, with brown hair,
247 He had that look of always being in control of things. He spoke slowly and succintly, but there was
248 a quiet urgency inflected in his speech. "I'm a film editor for WNBC in New York, and Leo here is my assistant."
249 "For several years, we have been gathering informaton on McKane's activities, for use in an expose
250 should Leroy take a fall. We've been monitoring everything from DC to gigahertz, and we got some incredible stuff."
251 "Leo, and Lou and I were all in Naval Intelligence together for a while..." 
252 The big man took a long drink from his can, and continued. "Then this guy Pervis starts nosing around,and
253 stumbles across something that could blow the whole thing. He's in hiding, and we have got to find him."
254 "The guy doesn't realize the damage he could do to the the defense of the free world."
255 He drained the can, and turned to look at Lou. "Shall we show them?"
256 Lou got up, and motioned; "Follow me."
257    
258    Delta let out a low whistle as they entered the small room. Along the wall was a bank of recievers and a number
259 of spectrum analyzers, connected to a large panel that fed in turn, to a bank of IBM computers. George explained.
260 "It's all simple, actually. We pick up most of the transmissions at WNBC, and re-broadcast the important stuff
261 on the network. On NBC." He pointed to a Sony monitor on the desk. It's all converted to pulse code modulation"
262 "It's the same system the FBI uses. The transmissions are hidden in the blanking bar. Thats how they
263 send pictures of fugitives to their field offices. Turn your TV to an NBC or ABC station, and adjust the vertical
264 hold till you can see that black bar on the screen. Look on the right side, and sometimes you'll see some little
265 black and white lines flickering off and on. That's converted to pictures with a few modifications to any TV set"
266 Lou took over the explanation. "Then I just tune in to NBC with the sattellite reciever here, and while everyone
267 is watching the A Team, I'm reading McKanes transmissions. Fortunately, they haven't gone to the Cambridge Code..."
268    "With this other stuff, I listen to the Russkies. Get some good stuff when the skip is in"
269 
270 Delta interrupted. "Fascinating, but I'd like to have a look around while there's still some light left"
271 He looked at Lou. "Got a plane I can borrow?..."
272 
273 A few minuted later, the Navy blue Corsair lifted off the icy runway, and streaked into the sky...

277 It seemed to Milchar that he had been walking for hours, though he knew,
278 logically, it had only been a few minutes.  Perhaps it was the effect of the
279 atmosphere combined with the hypnotic effect of the terrain, which rose and
280 fell at regular intervals.  At a closer inspection, the depressions in the
281 ground appeared to be the tracks of a large sluglike creature.  Milchar decided
282 he didn't want to meet one, but just then, he did.
283 It was a dark orange color, and it had huge eyestalks.  Further detail was
284 obscured by the denser-than-normal yellow fog that surrounded it.  It seemed
285 interested in having a mage as a light snack.
286 Milchar released a bolt of energy at it, hoping to scare it away.  After a
287 brief pause it continued to believe that Milchar was the Blue Plate Special.
288 Its maw opened slightly, allowing its corrosive saliva to fall and sizzle
289 slightly on the ground.
290 Milchar realized he could not continue throwing energy at it for long, so he
291 confused it instead.  With a short word, the likeness of two more Milchars
292 sprang into being.  The beast looked puzzledly at the three, then dove for the
293 image on the right.
294 "Ha, missed, you ugly sonofa Sirian Megapuppy!" Milchar yelled as the beast
295 became familiar with the hard ground.  Milchar jumped quickly to another spot,
296 shifting the illusions as he did so.  "C'mon, jump into this crevasse over
297 here.  Look, it's a nice, flat spot with a freshly killed me on it."  And as
298 Milchar said this, the crevasse appeared so.
299 
300 This was too much for the beast, who was getting hungry chasing after this
301 sttubborn, scrawny litte animal.  It leapt upon what it thought was dinner, and
302 fell to its squishy death below.
303 "There.  Hope there's not any more of these horrors around here.  Bambi they
304 ain't."
305 A low hum made itself heard in the yellow mist.
306 "Oho, sounds like company.  Bye, bozo, hope you have fun down there.  I'll
307 just go see who's knocking at the door, okay?  Won't talk to me, eh?  All
308 right, just BE stuck-up."

324     "Parity, did you know about all this stuff?" Fellows eyes bulged only
325 slightly as he strained to keep the excitement and surprise at the array
326 of electronic equipment to a visible minimum.
327     "NET did know that others were monitoring McKane, and fortunately we also
328 are very familiar with the sort of modulation transmission we have seen here.
329 But no, I had no idea of the complexity of the set-up here. Ian's intelligence
330 strikes again."
331     "Yes, it does." Fellows turned to the other men. "All this electronic
332 snooping is fine and good, but you are missing the bigger picture of McKane
333 and what the remnants of his organization have accomplished. Leroy is, or
334 was as we publicly proclaim, a very smart man. He knew better than to trust
335 his most sensitive information to the whims of the airwaves. He had a very
336 complex network of agents working all over the world. He could afford such
337 extravagant measures because, like it or not, Dial-a-Prayer and little fuzzy
338 animals rake in a lot of dough."
339      "Of course we realize that there is another part." George was proud of
340 his equipment, but he was not a stupid man. "That is why you are here. You
341 can fill in the parts of the puzzle that we have not been able to since we
342 are not part of a large organization such as your 'net', and we have no
343 intention to start anything like that up."
344      Parity spoke up. "Gentlemen, I think we understand each other. While
345 Delta is away, let's compare notes." Producing a large envelope from under
346 his coat, Parity looked straight in George's eyes. "The best stuff is here.
347 Let's trade and see what we come up with."
348      "Fine, just fine. Parity. It is good doing business with you. No 'BS',
349 no hidden meaning. You shoot straight from the him and your aim is
350 straight. Let me tell you, it is indeed a pleasure." It was the highest form
351 of compliment George could give.
352      "Why thank you. I learned a long time ago that the only way to deal
353 with people is to deal straight with them. The truth only hurts if someone
354 has something to hide. Everything else is crap." Fellows nodded his
355 approval, but with slightly less zeal than Parity would have liked to see.
356      That's the trouble, thought Fellows to himself. It is so easy to
357 speak like that when surrounded with people who feel the same way, but so
358 hard to live that way when you are not.

366 gazed at times to come.
367 all has been reveiled and tears that he
368 shed were for you.
369 a flash of light slits the night, chills
370 the blood in his veins. feel the power

375   Irritated at the sound of his voice, the piper shrugged and shifted, trying
376 to think out his situation.  Somehow his captor was providing him a breathable
377 atmosphere -- excluding the noxious yellow green gas that seemed to be the 
378 main component of the outside "air".  He searched his mind for just how this
379 could possibly occur, running over and over his few blurred memories of his
380 capture.  Something very large had grasped him.  There was a feeling of
381 solidity in his present position -- whatever it was was not moving...
382 Somehow the question arose in his mind -- what if it were not capable of
383 locomotion?  What if it were sa sessile animal, rooted in one spot, capturing
384 it
385 it's food as it passed bye?  --Or perhaps a plant with some mobility?  That
386 would explain the breathable air -- pictures of the common carnivorous plants
387 flickered past his mind's eye.  The stench!  Carnivorous plants often captured
388 their prey and let it die and rot, absorbing the products of decay -- sometimes
389 hastening the liquification with their own digestive fluids.  He shuddered
390 at the feeling of the slick moisture around him.

408 High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water..
409 nine years worth of breakin' my back...
410 there's no sun in the shadow of the wizard..
411 why see him glide, why he's lighter that air..

413 Oh I see his face...
414 Where is your star , is it far? is it far?
415 When do we leave?

418 Hot wind movin' fast across the desert
419 we feel our time has arrived
420 The world spins, while we put his dream together
421 A tower of stone to take hhim straight to the sky..
422 
423 In the heat and the rain
424 With whips and chains
425 To see him fly,
426 We built a tower of stone
427 With our flesh and bone
428 To see him fly,
429 but we don't know why,
430 Now where do we go....
431 
432 All eyes see the figure of the wizard
433 As He Climbs to the top of the world...
434 No sound, as he falls instead of rising..
435 Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand..
436 Oh I see his face
437 
438 Where was your star?
439 Was it far was it far?
440 When did we leave
441 We believed We believed We believed..

446     As he topped the rise, Bard spotted Piper's bagpipes. But where was
447 piper? 
448     Wait a second... that lump over there had moved. It looked like a 
449 typical 'grabber'-type organism. He'd seen a lot of them on other chlorine
450 worlds. It *was* big enough to have grabbed Piper. He chuckled. At least
451 he'd picked a good place to get 'eaten'.
452     He turned on the external speaker. 
453     "Hello? Piper, are you in there?"
454     There was a muffled response. 
455     "Bard? Is that you?....Get me OUT of here!"
456     Bard unsheathed his machete. "I'll have you out in a few minutes...
457 don't worry it can't hurt you!"
458     Bard started chopping at the 'root' of the creature. It quivered and 
459 tried to turn to get at him. Luckily Piper's weight kept it from moving far
460 enough. Finally he cut through. The creature a final shudder and quit
461 moving.
462     Now to get him out... Bard walked to the 'mouth' of the creature and
463 started prying it open. In a few moments he had wedged it open. He'd have 
464 to move fast now. He grabbed Piper's ankles and pulled. 
465     Nothing happened. He pulled harder. With a sucking sound Piper slith-
466 ered out. He started coughing as the chlorine hit him. Bard stuffed him 
467 into the rescue ball and sealed the seam. As it filled with air Piper 
468 collapsed. Bard turned on the lifter and as it floated clear of the ground
469 he started to tow it back to the conveyer. 
470     Suddenly he stopped. Walking back he picked up the bagpipes and slung
471 them over his shoulder. Shaking his head at the thought of what Piper would
472 have said if he'd left them.
473      Later in the conveyer, Bard explained to Piper, "Well, I know it was
474 unpleasant in there but you were actually quite safe..."
475      "SAFE! I was about to be digested by that thing!"
476      "Yes, they use a quite powerful corrosive gas to aid their rather weak
477 digestive fluids....it's called oxgen."

501 Marvin stoood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a partivcularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in yhe
502 ldusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing.
503 He did, howerevererever, look pitifully small l as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank 
504 examined him eiwith with a probe. the The probe withdrew.
505 Marvin stood there.
506 "Out of my way little robot,"growled the tank.
507 "I'm afraid," said Marvin,"Thattahat I've been left here to stop you."
508 The probe extended again for a wquick recheck. It withdrew again.

513 The tank's engines riuumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized electronic relays^
514 deep in its microbrain flippeped backeard in consternation.
515 "Guess?" said the tank.
516  Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second and along a third. The builgding continued to rock a
517 and suddrer hudeder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the building up, why was it taking so long?
518 With difficulty they reached on of a number of taotally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden
519 jolt it opened and they fell indiside.
520 All this way, thought Zapghod, all this trouble, alll this no-t-lying-on -the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time, and for what?

522 t and single, revolutionary new form of paper clip, was empty.
523 "Where,"said Zaphod,"is Zarniwoop?"feeling that his already tenuous grasp of the point of this whole ecxercise was beginning
524 to slip. "Hwe'sds  on an intergalactic cruise," said the man.
525 Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought , not a barrel ogf laughs. He probabalyly appotioned a fair whack

563 To above, yes, so why don't you stop your infintile biching. One thing you
564 might like to consider, when you bitch about something and use the same
565 kind of form to bitch as those you are bitching about, it completely 
566 invalidates anything you say. After all, here you are doing the same
567 thing that your bitching about, so who is going to bother listening?
568 Second point, yes, there is some arguing here, but there is arguing on
569 other systems too, it is just that most don't read them because of the
570 isolated nature of the boards. When you are forced to read everyones 
571 messages other then just the ones you find interesting for whatever reason,
572 it causes things to take on a whole different veiwpoint. I am interested
573 as to why you consider Ripple to be infantile. The reactive response of the
574 Innkeeper to having something of his creation "destroyed" I can understand,
575 we all react that way once in a while. That doesn't make him stupid or
576 posseive of a low IQ, only human. Ripple on the other hand tried to help
577 things out by providing a story line that would satisfy all concerned.
578 Instead of bitching about it, she did something about it. This is a very
579 positive and non-childish (if we are to use your term) thing to do.
