21 On the fun note: Last night I was just finishing up my work and
22 getting ready to go home. So I started doing my backups. Put the floppy
23 in A, type BAK (my backup batch file.) go off and go to the bathroom, come
24 back and find a message on the screen to the effect that the floppy was
25 full. Oh rats, well, I'll just erase everything on the floppy and try
26 again. I know there is enough room, so it probably was just having problems
27 with a file that was too big. C:DEL *.*  Delete everything (Y/N) ? Y
28 (Yes, of course I want to erase everything you stupid machine!) (Ok, but
29 I warned you!) Hmmmmmmm. ACK! C:! NO! ^C^C^C^C^C^C^C^ NO! I was just 
30 kidding! Stop! Stop! ....... C:     Sigh....... C:cd\util\norton   C:nu
31 followed by 3 three hours of attempting to unerase the last three months
32 of work. Luckily between previous backups and what little Norton decided to
33 recover properly I think I go4 it all back. Sigh... I don't like going 
34 through that sort of thing. I'm glad I keep backups, or it might have
35 been worse.

65 I would assume that any launch towards this country would automatically result
66 in a launch towards Russia, Key or no key.  It is interesting, but not 
67 suprising, that there would be a bunker under the White House, but if a nuclear
68 device were detonated on the surface above it, instead of in the atmosphere,
69 it would almost certainly vaporize it.  What I was really referring to was the
70 principle of a war. If you kill off the other countries leaders, then don't you

130 	Little Fuzzy Animals (words & music: Frank Hayes)
131 
132 When you land on Baileys 7, You may not like what you see
133 There are monsters there behind each rock and up in every tree
134 There are demon flies up in the sky and manticores beneath
135 And there's little fuzzy animals WITH	BIG	SHARP	TEETH!
136 	There are little fuzzy animals, little fuzzy animals
137 	little fuzzy animals with big sharp teeth
138 Now not all the creatures there should fill you full of dread
139 For the Demon flies speak English and they love to scout ahead
140 And the manticores will haul you through the swamp and through the mud
141 But the little fuzzy animals	WILL	DRINK	YOUR	BLOOD!
142 	Yes, the little fuzzy animals, little fuzzy animals
143 	little fuzzy animals will drink your blood
144 Now when nightfall comes to Bailey's with the shadows growing steep
145 The music of the jungle night will lull you into sleep
146 It's so restful and so peaceful that you'll never feel the pain
147 From the little fuzzy telepaths	WHO	EAT	YOUR	BRAIN!
148 	Yes, the little fuzzy telepaths, little fuzzy telepaths
149 	little fuzzy telepaths who eat your brain
150 When you land on Baileys 7 now, you'll know what lies in store
151 There are hordes of harmless fiends and gentle monsters there galore
152 With all the cute and fuzzy ones you'll know just what to do..
153 Get those little fuzzy buggers	BEFORE	THEY	GET	YOU!
154 	Get those little fuzzy animals, little fuzzy animals
155 	little fuzzy animals	BEFORE	THEY	GET	YOU.
156 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
157 	Little Fuzzy Characters (words: Jordin Kare, music:see above)
158 
159 When you sit down at Frank's typer, why, you may like what you see.
160 The screen scrolls up so smoothly as you tap upon the keys.
161 But when you get a printout, you will fly into a rage
162 At those little fuzzy characters upon your page.
163 	Those little fuzzy characters, little blurry characters,
164 	Little fuzzy characters upon your page.
165 Ah, but if it's Frank that's typing, and you're reading what he's writ,
166 And the meaning is unclear to you, with words that do not fit,
167 It isn't that you're foolish, and it isn't that you're dense,
168 It's those little fuzzy sentences that make no sense.
169 	Those little fuzzy sentences, complex compound sentences,
170 	Little fuzzy sentences that make no sense.
171 Yet if you keep on reading, and you find things coming clear,
172 And your brain is filled with wonders, with visions new and queer,
173 Then _that's_ when you should worry, for he's driving you insane
174 With those little fuzzy paragraphs that rot your brain.
175 	Those little fuzzy paragraphs, right justified paragraphs,
176 	Little fuzzy paragraphs that rot your brain.
177 So if you see frank at his typer, it is best you run away
178 To save your sight and sanity. But if you have to stay
179 Then pluck the petals from his daisy wheels... Coat his disks with super glue...
180 Get those little fuzzy letters... before they get you!

185 He looked up from his keyboard apprehensively. The SYSGEN had not taken, and
186 the host machine still responded with an incorrect inquiry statement. He thought
187 he knew a work-around, but that attempt had ended with the loss of two spool
188 files and a logout. His second attempt, using a CREPE program that would
189 automatically retry on receiving a failed code. It failed once, but instead of
190 regenerating, it's access node was deleted. No sense on figuring out what
191 caused its deletion, he thought to himself. Time was of the essence. Now it was
192 time to try something completely different. He pushed back his chair and got
193 up from the desk. He walked over to the bookcase, the limp in his left leg
194 very noticeable. He ran his hand over the top row of books in the case. Titles
195 passed beneath his fingers. Advanced Analogous Algorithms. The Complete IPL
196 Handbook. Congruent Microprocessor design. Finally his hand rested on a brown
197 and red striped book entitled Bituminous Access Protocols. Taking the book
198 from the shelf, he returned to his seat. Turning to page 141, he began to read.
199 The screen blinked RETRY? He turned the page.

262 We must not be so down on people who desire a peaceful coexistence with his
263 fellow man. I see no reason why there should be such hatred toward person or
264 persons based on their political beliefs or that they speak a language not
265 based on the Anglo-Saxon tongue.
266 I myself feel that we are all children of the world and that the earth is our
267 playground. To correspond with our neighbors throughout this world should be
268 one of our highest goals and we should
269 make every attempt to eshow our true feelings when we make these contacts.

300 	What if, the pressure and heat required to cause an atomic reaction
301 such as those found in nuclear devices was reduced? Say, by a margin of ten
302 percent? The primary effect I suppose is the ease with which nuclear
303 reactions such as fission and fusion could be caused. Any even primitive
304 experiments would have a significantly larger chance of success. For
305 instance, an effect of this could be the Nazi development of nuclear devices
306 before the end of the Second World War.
307 	With the help of physicists from occupied European nations, and their
308 own Aryan race, the Nazis would have produced nuclear devices. Almost
309 certainly before the Manhattan Project in the States. Using their V-2 rockets
310 to carry them, they could have delivered at least three nuclear device
311 payloads. One to across the English Channel to perhaps London. One overland
312 to the bleak Russian city of Stalingrad. And if deposited in New York Harbor,
313 by a U-Boat, at New York City.
314 	What then? The world in tatters, the populations of continents at the
315 whim of the German High Command and the Third Reich. The politics and
316 military aspects of it are almost too vast to imagine. America, England and
317 Russia would almost surely have fallen to the onward march of Nazi troops,
318 and the oppression of the Imperial Japanese warplanes and forces. Whatever
319 this horrible and frightful world would be like, there would still be a sad
320 ray of hope for the persecuted masses. Physics students working in this
321 alternate universe would have less difficulty providing the Resistance with
322 nuclear weapons.

439 I heard that German existentialism is sort of like existential Humanism 
440 and if it is I think it should be stopped. God doesn't believe in free 
441 love and stuff like that and that's what existentialism and secular 
442 humanism is all about. I think the WHO CARES? messages are a satanic 
443 attempt to subconsiously program our minds in evil ways. I know this 
444 can happen because I had an uncle who was a Christian missionary in 
445 Russia and he told be all about how the communists use these kinds 
446 of messages to pervert peoples thinking and to turn them away from 
447 the Lord. I think the WHO CARES? messages should be banned from Backwater.

461 WHO CARES?
462  I like this bullitien board system, this is the first time that I have called and iI am still confused. Oh well, as for the Who463 Cares messages, keep it up. Its good to see after a serious message about nuclear warfair, a very hot subject these days, 
464  it knocks the mind off the destruction track in its brain(track 37 I think, sector 17)

504     The boy's eyes open briefly the next day, a few
505     days later he takes some liquid food, and over
506     the ensuing weeks he begins to eat and sleep
507     regulary. As the year turns to spring the old
508     doctor patiently teaches him to stand, then to
509     walk unaided. The boy develops into a strange
510    silent child, who likes to stand for hours under
511     the trees in the big gardens surrounding the
512     house. The doctor notices that the gardener and
513     housekeeper will not look directly into his face
514     and always cross themselves when they pass
515     him.
516 
517     His face is always completly smooth and
518     experssionless, though the eyes are sometimes
519     quick to follow any movement, he regards
520     everything in an impassive animal way. It is as
521     though he has not yet learned to connect his facial
522     movements to his mental processes. The doctor
523     cannot induce him to speak or make any vocal
524     sound, and he becomes terribly saddened by the
525     boy's lack of progress.
526 
527 [C    One night in the Summer the old doctor is lying
528     awake in his bed. The windows are open onto
529     the garden. It is dark outside and raining.
530     A smell of rain and moise roses on the night
531     breeze.
532 
533     the boy stands by the doctor's bed looking
534     down at him.
535 
536     "It is time now, to be leaving."

555 As I was waiting for the bus a funny thing happened to me.
556 Someone spilled goulash on my brand new K-MART tenny runners.
557 I reached into my pocket and pulled my hand out again.
