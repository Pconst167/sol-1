135 I was doing nightbeat at the ad building.  Possibilities were endless and the
136 money was good -- even for us lower-level prostitutes in the swingshift sweat-
137 shop.  Although we performed our tubal litegations dutifully with a minimum of
138 supervision (none at all if truth be told), we had paused from the drudge one
139 night just long enough to discuss atrocities and swap horror stores on the 
140 perils of working swingshift.  Trsts of this sort are generally called staff
141 meetings, or committee or board meetings, or sometimes even hen parties or
142 group therapy ... whatever.  All depends on who you are.
143  
144 I can remember what brought it on, but we were conferring on safety prodecures
145 for late night prowls to such places as ... well, say the restroom, for in-
146 stance.  So a fellow floozie starts retelling the one about how she'd been
147 scared poopless one night when she'd entered the restroom only to find a
148 custodian snoozing on the adjoining sitting room sickbed.
149  
150 I followed her with accounts of my own tortuous trips to the candy and pop
151 machines downstairs, point out that although I preferred the north stairwell,
152 it made the trip twice as long and you still had to traverse a long, deafen-
153 ingly silent hallway and turn a corner.  With the south stairs, I reasoned,
154 you could at least see the machines from the door and could make a mad dash
155 and be gone.
156  
157 But the south stairwell had heavy concrete walls and a twist midway that 
158 not only made for incredible accoustics, but you couldn't see around the
159 corner (goes without saying, I guess).  And te steel doors at both ends
160 were so heavy they could hardly be opened or, due to some wonder device, 
161 shut.  They had to SLAM shut ... slowly.  And just about the tme you're
162 becoming paranoid about turning the corner, BAAAMMM! the door slams, sending
163 bone-chilling echoes up and down the stairwell and chills up your spine,
164 starting a chain reactionwhere even quiet footsteps seem thunderous and,
165 amplified with your own rapid heartrbeat and pounding in your ears, becomes
166 almost deafening and the steepness and light color of the stairs begins 
167 making you feel lightheaded and almost dizzy.  And all the while you know,
168 in the back of your mind, terrorized screams for help would be muffled by
169 that same reverberating concrete and the heavy steel doors ... should
170 "anthing happen" to you ... on the way down.
171  
172 But then, when you've finally reach the machines and are feeling quite
173 confident and concentrating on candy choices ... baammm! the second door
174 is slammed by its wonder device and for just a moment that same panic sets
175 in and you're sure somebody's down there with you ready to pounce from
176 out of the shadows.
177  
178 ... or that sluggish, silent elevator that always seemed to sneak up on you,
179 someone else suggested, arriving just in the midst of a pleasant revelrie
180 conduring during the endless wait ... the elevator that sometimes seemed to
181 have a mind of its own, making tedious prolonged stops, slowly opening its
182 decelerated doors to pick up God Knows Who ...
183  
184 ... OR, I beseeched, marshalling a "dark and story" demeanor anda nodding
185 to the glassed-in back wall with its door to the adjacent darkened library ... 
186 did they ever wonder if there might be someone hiding back in the library ...
187 lursking in the dark shadows ... just watching and .... (pregnant pause)
188 waiting????
189  
190 ... and with widened eyes, they all slowly turned their heads ... and DID
191 notice something -- a tiny flashlight beam ... groping in the dark.  A
192 chocked doubletake and we discoveed, to our utter amazement -- and dismay --
193 someone actually WAS back there ... and it was, on no ... the Big Mac,
194 Himself.
195  
196 Poop you not!

198 It was McElroy, our ringleader's X-boxx, with some burgher "probably re-
199 vamping their latest reorganization," someone ventured before we exchanged
200 worried "deep deep dodo time" looks and snapped back to our keyboards/CRTs
201 and such projects as administrators' wives' theses.
202  
203 Well, I was doing Daytime next day -- it must've been a Monday because I
204 wrked Days on Mondays or it could've been a Friday because I volunteered
205 alot of them, too; but actually it could've been most anyday 'cause I 
206 tended to victimize myself that way thinking I was being "cooperatsive"
207 and "flexible."  But whichever, I was publicly Attacked fo our group's
208 shenanigans (contrary to my contractual rights, I might add); evidently
209 our Ringleader had gotten The Word that her night girls did nothing but
210 sit around shooting the breeze all evening.  Of course, I didn't know
211 whether to laugh or cry (I think I cohse the latter -- stress levels, you
212 know).  And I've never even revealed this Amazing Fate to anybody until now
213 (obviously Codependence/Dysfunctinality Syndrome).  But personally, I cher-
214 ish crazy coincidences and consistently contemplate their credence.
215  
216 And even today I continue to wonder what looked sillier -- a bunch of women
217 turning their heads in unison with looks of pretend terror on the faces
218 slowing turning to absolute astonishment then to real terror ... or the two
219 Peeping Dons standing in the dark peering in at a bunch of women obviously
220 engaging in those shadowy consipracys that rend companys asunder ...

231 Well, last night saw the return of Twin Peaks.  It was even a fairly 
232 good peaks episode.  The recap at the begining ought to have helped
233 out those who haven't seen the show before, though it was a bit to
234 short to be of to much use.  They could have taken up the entir hour
235 explaining everything, and still had people baffled. 
236  
237 I don't think TP will be back for another season, and that is sad.  There
238 really is so little on TV that interests me in the least.  TP is a show I
239 can actually watch two or three times and still be entertained.  There 
240 is just so much going on in almost any given scene that you can't help 
241 but miss some of it the first couple of times through.

248 HOME:  About that book .... one really SHOULD be done.  I included Margaret 
249 Atwood and Martin Scorsese on the "cc" list of the lengthy documents of
250 pertinent details I had the Union's secretary "sign for" for my trial by
251 water but, of course, I was just joshing 'em.  I doubt they saw the humor,
252 but I'd wager my clone they're STILL quivering in ther boots <grin>.  And
253 knowing you're already doing 17 things at once ... as always ... and would
254 probably prefer a room without a view (in that direction anyway), I think 
255 a former floozie from the swingshift sweatshop could probably do a wonderful
256 job of it.  She placed in a WILLAMETTE WEEK short fiction competition short-
257 ly before she returned to NY, then evidently wrote a huge tome at home a
258 few years later.  I don't think I ever told you but her "friend" worked for
259 this very same institution, too.  While I knew she was doing magazine
260 articles and book reviews, I hadn't noticed she'd written a book until I
261 hppened upon it at the library almost immediately after your remark about
262 your ... uh, hmmmm ... "friend's" credentials.  Like I said, her dad wrote
263 a book which was later adapted for a moving starring Anthony Quinn, but I
264 now think dhe's also related to a SF writer/moviemaker who related to 
265 myriad magazine moguls (she never mentioned it though).  She's the "punk" I
266 told you about once that had been a "groupie" for a local NY band that, it
267 turned out, included my roommate's wacky Oregonian stepsister's LA husband
268 (her FIRST name was Jessica Rose Boogie; I never memorized her last but it
269 was even longer <a recent letter said "r jade" so looks like she's shortened
270 it somewhatly. but she'd be another rather fun novel herself ... she AND her
271 family!).
272  
273 But I think there's also an abundance of additional options ... there's so
274 many pertinent issues involved, I think alot could be made of it lots of
275 places.

289 Wow, for such a long time I had terrible credit.  (It wasn't my fault,
290 but the credit people didn't care.)  Anyway, suddenly I seem to be able
291 to get credit everywhere.  Getting that first credit card was a heck of
292 a break through.  I went down to apple music today to see about applying
293 for credit.  After filling out a form and waiting for about fifteen 
294 minutes I got the OK on a $1500 in house credit card limit.  I
295 got a nice used 12 string guitar (Now I just have to figure out how to
296 tune it.)  A Yamaha four track recording deck.  (Now I just have to 
297 figure out how to use it.)  A nice Microphone, a pickup for the 
298 accoustic, a tuner and some strings and picks.  After I pay some of 
299 this off I'm going to buy a MIDI keyboard.
300  
301 I even have some money left over on the limit.  I did notice one thing,
302 being a computer junkie has really jaded me in terms of money.  When
303 a decent hard drive costs 4 to 600 bucks, its hard to blink at paying
304 similiar sums of money for musical instruments and such.
305  
306 So, now I have 4 guitars.  I seem to be collecting them.

381 THE CYCLE OF ABUSE

383 It's not like I wasn't prewarned of the consequences or anything.  I'd been
384 told countless times it would only make matters worse.  And, of course, it
385 did.
386  
387 Kinda reminds me of he stor a former teacher once told in the staff lounge
388 one noon about another teacher who noticed signs of physical abuse on one
389 of her students and, as is required of teachers and physicians, reported it.
390 The CDS promptly removed the kid from his home for two weeks and, of course,
391 when the kid was required to return home he was REALLY in trouble.  He ended
392 up in the hospital.

467                  ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER
468  
469 SALEM--The Department of Public Waterways is probing the buildup of algae
470 and other pollutants in the meandering waterway affectionately known as
471 backwater. The damage was first reported to authorities by the little
472 knon Albanian firebrand, Mohamme Wassir, who had become lost hile
473 searching for camls. This normally placid stream with its iridescent clay
474 bottom and woody debris hs become choked with plants ad scum.
475  
476 Phosphates and oter fertilizer have befouled is otherwise normally muddy
477 apearance.  To clean it up wil require massive taxpayer assstance.

478 Early estimates predict a need to close down unproductive schools in the
479 state in order to fund this project. A lake may have to be drained to
480 increase stream flow.  Developers are beginning to discuss ways of
481 utilizing this, soon to be available, fertile land for public assisted
482 housing.
483  
484 Wassir plans to sue public sewerage agencies for allowing these phosphates
485 to enter waterways.  The concrete industries in conjunction with the
486 highway department are studying the possibility of paving the bottom to
487 keep the naturally occurring phosphates in the clay mud from leaching into
488 this pristine environment.  The EPA will be looking into the possibility of
489 providing special eddy areas for fish and other denizens to take care of
490 their elimination needs in a somewhat more organized manner.  All this will
491 take cash.
492  
493 Sewer bills may have to be as high as 1200 to 1400 a month. Although there
494 are seemingly few inhabitants of this quiet area, and they have been
495 observed talking to themselves, one can't help but wonder what changes
496 these improvements will bring? Is this the sort of place for supernatural
497 dreamers or reminiscing secretaries?
498  
499 The activist, Wassir, is pleased with the impact his actions have had so
500 far.  He has been meeting with Lloyd Marbet, his radiant adviser and may
501 tackle that Chinese company Wah Chang next.  We'll attempt interviews in
502 the future to keep you apprised of any fast moving developments should any
503 surface.

541      I first saw the grey lady out behind the Backwater Inn.  My boss,
542 Conroy Portner, and I had a job back there.  Conroy is a private detective,
543 but the private dick business being what it is, he sometimes has to
544 fall back on his old trade, plumbing.  That's where this job came in,
545 something had backed up the Backwater to the point the neighbors were
546 complaining.  We had to fix it.  My name is Wolfgang Amadeus Jones,
547 but most folks call me Skip.  I'm Conroy's apprentice.
548      The Backwater Inn had lately gone to seed.  Overgrown bushes 
549 surrounded the place and the shutters were askew.  A Rowan tree in front
550 sorely needed some creative pruning.  Conroy was never a social sort,
551 we passed by the Inn and crossed a rough-hewn footbridge.  Following
552 the stream, we entered the forest behind the Inn.  Not too far into the
553 forest, it became evident that something was seriously wrong.  The stream
554 had overflowed its banks and become a small lake.
555      Conroy motioned me down a small bank at the edge of the lake.
556 "Aha," he said, "I think I know what the problem is."
557      "What?" I said.
558      "The outlet to the stream is plugged.  Look."  He pointed to a 
559 culvert stuffed with a jumble of branches, pond scum, and assorted debris.
560 "Wolfgang," Conroy said, "hand me the plumbing snake."
561      "It's Skip."
562      "What?"
563      "I want you to call me Skip."
564      "Ha!  Last week you wanted me to call you Spike.  Why don't I just
565 call you Muffy like your girlfriend?"
566      I felt me ears getting red, so I shut up and handed him the plumbing
567 snake. Conroy bent to the task and worked on the culvert.  He may be a
568 short little cuss, but no one handles a snake like Conroy.  Sometimes
569 when he gets pissed, people make the mistake of laughing.  With his
570 red hair and face, he looks like a fire plug with a gland problem.  I
571 only made that mistake once.
572      "Nope," he said, "this isn't going to work.  We'll have to dig this
573 puppy out by hand."
574      We pulled out the branches and garbage by hand.  One of the first things
575 I found was a toilet plunger.  "Kid, let me see that,"  Conroy said.  He
576 examined it and scratched his head.  "What was the name on the invoice
577 for this job?"
578      I checked the invoice.  "Wassir.  M. Wassir."
579      "Curious.  This is an Albanian plunger.  Very rare, produced by
580 a company owned by an Albanian named Mohammed Wassir a few years back.
581 I thought he was dead.  Let's see what other treasures are in here.
582      Over the next two hours, we discovered an assortment of curiosities
583 in the culvert.  Along with the plunger, we found in no particular order:
584    A pasquinade regarding the local school system,
585    A dingbatted maledicta in good condition,
586    A love letter to someone named Natasha signed by Leroy McKane,
587    Several sets of love letters to someone named Pam by various authors
588     <names withheld to protect the guilty>,
589    A Net decoder ring of inferior quality
590    Pen and ink drawings of dragons
591    An Illumnati I.D. card
592    A button reading "Tandy M100 rules",
593    Several hundred pages of news article rehashes,
594    Assorted bits of prose and poetry.
595      Finally, I had enough.  I told Conroy I was going up to the bank to
596 take a break.  He grunted and kept at the culvert.  I settled under a
597 tree for my afternoon nap.
598      "Kid, get your ass down here."
599      I struggled to my feet and walked to the edge of the bank, wiping
600 the sleep out of my eyes.  "What is it?  I said.
601      "I'm gonna call the cops."
602      "Honest, I gave up those funny cigarettes, just like you said."
603       "No it's not that," Conroy said.  I noticed he had a cigar clamped
604 in his mouth.  He stepped aside and I saw the grey lady sticking half-out
605 of the culvert.  Water trickled around her body.  "This broad has been
606 strangled."  He smiled.  "Break out your fedora, we've got ourselves a case.

645        "It's my own damn fault!" Alexis muttered as he ambled down the road
646 kicking rocks and feeling sorry for himself. "If I hadn't called it an
647 evironmental disaster, this would  never have happened."
648        It was his own fault, of course.  Desperate for a story he had
649 followed up on a chance conversation overheard in the county offices.  Some
650 kind of pollution thing.  Knowing public tastes, he had called it an
651 environmental disaster.  So now angry letters demanding action were sitting
652 on his editor's desk.
653        His editor was ecstatic.  There wasn't much action of any kind going
654 on so they didn't get much public response to local news.  A follow-up was
655 mandatory.  And who better than the guy who had uncovered the mess in the
656 first place?
657        The first time he had been out, his car had still been running. There
658 hadn't been much of anyone around to interview. He hung around the inn for a
659 while sampling its wares. Lately his biggest excitement in life came when
660 sipping an, as yet, untasted brew from some foreign land.
661        He wasn't exactly in his prime.  He'd quit his job in the big city to
662 write the great novel only to discover that he'd misplaced it.  It was
663 probably somewhere with his missing socks or in amongst the clutter of his
664 room.  After awhile, realizing that eating seemed to be his real passion, he
665 got a job with the local tabloid covering rural americana.
666        It was actually quite a lovely day, sunny and warm and crystal clear.
667 Certainly a change from all the rain.  But he wasn't thinking about weather.
668 He was plodding along cursing to himself that he had to come out to this old
669 inn again. There wasn't even a bus out this way.  So here he was, walking
670 along in his clever disguise as a fisherman.
671        Course he had a fly fishing outfit which was all he owned.  It had
672 been a gift from his ex father-in-law who was a confirmed fisher type
673 person.
674 The pond he was headed to was more suited to a cane pole with a bobber on
675 the
676 end.  But Alexis wasn't enough of a fisherman to even realize how out of
677 place he would appear.
678        White flowers dotted the mountain ash adding a splash of color to the
679 otherwise dreary appearance of the inn.  Alexis decided it would be better
680 to
681 fish for a while before entering the inn. It would add some credence to his
682 cover.  Alexis crossed over the footbridge and entered the forest behind the
683 inn.

686      The California Grey was lashed by cables to the side of the 
687 pirate whaler.  Quick, yellow men deftly cut the whale's blubber
688 into long slabs to be stored in the ship's hold.  Steam arose
689 from the carcass in the chill of the north Pacific April night.
690 The men were experts and it would take them only two hours to
691 reduce the great animal to ribs and bones.
692      On the bridge, the captain and his first mate watched the
693 process with an air of competant boredom.
694      "She put up quite a fight didn't she, Captain," the mate said.
695      "Bah, nothing like the old days.  The big fish are no more."
696      "And the sport . . ." the mate prompted.  This coversation had
697 been played out before.
698      "And the sport is gone," the Captain said, "explosive harpoons
699 and sonar make the kill quick and sure.  Business."  He spat on the
700 floor.
701      From the rear of the bridge, the radar operator said, "Captain,
702 I have a radar contact bearing 270 at thirty miles."
703      "Greenpeace?"  the mate said.
704      "Perhaps," the Captain said, "but how did they get so close?"
705      "I don't know.  Should we unlimber the deck gun?"
706      "Yes, let's finish what the French started and sink the
707 Rainbow Warrior for good.  They are fools if they challenge us out
708 here with no one to see."  The Captain spat on the deck again and
709 both men laughed.
710      "Captain," the radar operator said, "I have two more contacts,
711 same bearing, closing fast."
712      The mate and Captain turned and peered through the gloom.  They
713 caught but a glimpse of the two missles skipping across the waves
714 before the first one took the ship directly amidships.  The second
715 one slammed into the engine room and it was mere seconds before the
716 ship sunk, pulled down by the weight of the California Grey.
717      Being a stubborn man, the mate clung to a hatch cover for two
718 hours even though he knew there would be no rescue.  Neither his
719 government nor the Tokyo-based corporation that owned his ship 
720 would admit to its existence.  Finally, he surrendered himself to
721 the sea, and the pirate whaler was no more.

783      Alexis started to hum to himself once he entered the shade of the 
784 forest.  He found that he was actually looking forward to fishing and was
785 wondering what sort of lure might attract one in these waters.  Poking
786 about amongst the flies and shinny spinners as he walked, he didn't even
787 see the dingbatted maledicta until it barked his shins.  It was puzzling at
788 first.  He'd seen maledictas before, but the only dingbat he'd known was
789 named Edith.
790      When he tripped over the pasquinade, he was at a complete loss. A
791 feeling of being in over his head began to overwhelm him!  He looked about
792 him at the mess that had been dredged up out of the water.
793      "Someone's been busy here," he muttered wishing he had someone
794 other than himself to mutter to.
795      It was then, that he noticed the culvert.  Or more specifically what
796 seemed to be stuck in the culvert.  His heart began to race and he became a
797 little short of breath.  Manys the time he had visualized himself coolly
798 investigating violent death and even solving the case for the inept
799 detectives assigned.  Yet suddenly, he had this queasy feeling in the pit
800 of his stomach.  He looked about wildly, hoping to see someone.  He didn't
801 want to go any closer by himself.
802      Whoever had been digging in the muck, must have gone off.  They had
803 to have seen the lady in the culvert.  Alexis forced himself to go down the
804 bank and get a closer look.  He slipped.  It was a damp, muddy, somewhat 
805 portly figure that puffed his way up the bank and out of the forest and 
806 into the inn.

828 Some days you wake up and you just know things aren't the same as they were
829 the day before. Today is such a day. Why you ask? Because in what seems like
830 one sudden swoop of activity, Backwater appears to live again. How long will
831 this bloom last? No one can say for sure. All I can do is enjoy the writing
832 while it lasts.
833  
834 Now to those specific users:
835  
836 kristig: Words almost fail me in my expression of happiness to see you here!
837          I take it your PC lives again, along with the modem you write about.
838          Just when I was about to give up on sweet miracles, you show up.
839          Thanks for the email! Happy belated birthday (check your snail mail!)
840 Astral:  Ok, no getting out of it next time. I want to hear you play,
841          and I don't care how "unpolished" you think you are! To a wannabe
842          player like myself, who is so frustrated with his current lack of
843          creative muses, *any* guitar playing sounds great. I am impressed
844          with your efforts at recording. Will you be able to make tapes that
845          you can play on your new (if slightly clawed) stereo system?
846 Wassir:  Just when we all thought it was safe to let our pets out at night,
847          you show up. Perhaps it is time to reactive a certain para-military
848          organization....
849 Mikey:   Have you given up with backwatr polling qiclab? Perhaps you can talk
850          to shawni@celene, who is able to connect when the system isn't busy.
851          The only changes are that the Telebit 2500 answers PEP tones first,
852          so you might have to increase the "wait for carrier" setting on your
853          modem...

858 L'Homme, I'm slowly building up a demo tape.  I've written four songs
859 so far.  I'm only really happy with two of them.  I'd be happy to 
860 pass on a copy of this tape at some point in the future.  Warning in 
861 advance, it is very rough.  The only thing I guarentee is that everything
862 is more or less in tune, and the tempo should be semi-consistant.  I've
863 learned that I can sing a little bit.  I'm thinking about taking
864 lessons in the near future, both guitar and voice.  Meanwhile I'll
865 practice, and maybe sometime I'll even work up the courage to perform
866 live.
867  
868 Anyway, its fun stuff.  Helps keep me busy.  And it has sort of been a 
869 dream of mine for a long time.

924 L'homme, give me some advance notice the next time you're going to stop by and
925 I'll make you a copy.  The tape is getting longer all the time.  I've written
926 about six songs, and am writting a new one about every four or five days.  
927 I don't know that I'll be able to keep this pace up.  Most of them will 
928 probably end up being throwaways, but if I manage to come up with just a 
929 few good ones I'll be happy.  
930  
931 On the down side is the fact that I don't really know anyone else that 
932 plays.  I wouldn't mind exploring the possibility of forming a part time
933 band.  I've always enjoyed playing.  When I was in High School Jazz band
934 I remember it being one part terror and one part thrill.  Oh well, I've
935 kinda taken the attitude that most things in life happen for a reason.  
936 Being a Rock & Roll star would be a passable life. :-)

975 No, the series is not over.  ABC canceled it.  There are two more episodes 
976 in the can, and they will be shown as a two hour movie on june 10.  Right
977 now it looks very unlikely that ABC will pick up TP for next year.  But, 
978 TP is very popular in England, spain, Australia and several other countries
979 around the world.  So, it is looking like there might be new episodes, but
980 they will be payed for by outside interests.  No telling wether or not they
981 will be availble here in the US.
982  
983 This show is not going to die easily.  Sort of sad that one of the best shows
984 on TV couldn't make it in the rateings.  Seems to me that this is just another
985 symptom of how far down this country has sunk.
