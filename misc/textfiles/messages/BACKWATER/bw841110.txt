21 discuss any and everything (maybe).

24   From Prometheus: The Designed
25   I was going to announce myself by calling myself Hawthorne, but I realized that with all the nw, and returning old patrons,
26 my last name isn't well known anymore. How quickly they forget.
27   To whomever mentioned 666; What you have called attention to is a fine example of ways in which co-incidences can be linked
28 together. Forming something that appears 'FORCED' or beyond the realm of real co-incidence.
29   I remeber an article in SMITHSONIAN recenetly which could be of great interest to you. Nary to mention victims of the Liquid
30 Orange as it is commonly referred to. Vile Orange Liquid is another name for it.
31   The article to which I refer has a list of about twelve seemingly incredible co-incidences between the assasinations of two
32 American presidents, Kennedy and Lincoln. As it turns out, four of the observations weren't true and the others were clutching
33 at straws. At least in my opinion. As feeble as that might actually be.
34   To Piper, about the prescence of an editor helping the structure not the content of any peice of writing; I agree.
35   What I was reppeating was simply saying that an editor could have deeper effects than just helping one story.
36   That what was learned from an editor, however begrudgingly, could train the writer to be better in their field later.
37   LMan in Gray, the blodclots seem to go away if the stricken clothing or blades or soaked in the saliva of the victim.
38   Wearing green clothes also helps, as green clothing isn't as easily stained by blood.
39   I went to a store called the Combat Corner, the local merc outfitters. And one of the attendants, a man named only to me as
40 GREGORY-VII, recommended the simple shovel. It seems that they are much easier cleaned of hair and blood traces. And less, er
41 revealing to pharencists.
42   I still am waiting for my father to let me have a chance at the key to the Gun rack in the black team's van.
43   That should be it, except for thzanking Annette for mentioning being at the top. A fine tradition that seems to be fading
44 from sight.

86 The Innkeeper slept restlessly, tossing and turning in his bed.
87 He draws the covers about him more closely to try to keep out the 
88 cold, but it is of little help. The darkness is oppressive.  Sleep 
89 comes to him fitfully, no position seems to be comfortable enough to 
90 relax. Sitting on the edge of the cot, the cold hard packed clay 
91 floor numbed his feet. Clasping the pillow to his breast, he slowly 
92 rocks back and forth. When will it all end? The noise and pressure 
93 is almost too much to bear. The close quiet darkness offers only 
94 marginal relief. The night seems to last forever. 
95 
96 Finally, the cold gray morning light begins to seep through the 
97 curtained window. Outside the garbage man is clattering the cans, 
98 and the birds are awake and greeting the dawn. The Innkeeper gets up 
99 and gets dressed, preparing for another day. Moving to the dresser, 
100 he sees the golden locket laying there. Picking it up, he opens it 
101 to see the Rowan twig encased in it. Ah, the memories it brings 
102 back. He can almost hear PAM once again in the Inn relating tales of 
103 her latest adventure. Almost?... He can hear her! Rushing to the 
104 doorway, he brushes aside the worn curtain. It was her! Sitting 
105 there talking to the early morning customers. But will she remember 
106 an old friend? Does she even care? He stood there mesmerized by her 
107 once more appearing in his humble establishment.

116 Mikey: The club is easily fixed. The adventure is written so it is easy to add messages and such. Something like,
117 "The club clatters on the far wall, but nothing happens...". As for the BASIC. If have NEVER heard of a basic that
118 couldn't handle nested if's. Even the commode 64 can do that. In regards to mixed mode disk I/O, do you mean numeric
119 and alphabetic in the same I/O operation? This sounds like a real funky basic. There is no color in the basic 
120 adventures, only inverse video and I believe double intensity. Is this too much for the Sanyo too? Both programs are
121 written under BASICA, and work on such machines as the Tandy 2000 w/o modification save the force capslock and clear
122 KB buffer type ahead. If you would like me to work on them to make them Sanyo compatible, let me know. I guess these
123 "intense" conversations can hold until next week (phone call), we wouldn't want to subject the other patrons to that
124 horrid computer talk!
125 Kathy: Too wordy? What else can rhetoric be? Would you call Borges wordy when he questions our existence on our little
126 planet? Would you rather have spartan prose describe life? I would like to think that life, in all of its infinite
127 expressions, can not be put aside with a few choice words of succinct diction and writer's guide approved paragraphs.
128 But thanks for the comments, next time I'll try Carlinesque.
129 Milchar: Ack! Multicolor doesn't work! Hires does, but not Multicolor. I get a blank screen, but if I go to multi-
130 color character mode, I get a green box on the screen. What gives? Also, XMON has a terrible disassem. It can't tell
131 the difference between a byte or word load, which messes up the next (n) instructions until it comes to something it
132 knows for sure again. Very frustrating. Are any of thoese other monitors any better?

136 The Diamond Valley glitters and shimmers and is gorgeous.  But is is also
137 sharp and cold and comfortless and I don't like it one bit.  What good
138 does this kind of beauty do you? You can't farm it, can't hug it, burn it
139 or eat it, so let's get on with this and get out of here, Milchar.  Not
140 fair.  Milchar is struggling with consciousness.
141 I am making a mental chart about who holds what power, who holds a grudge
142 or wants revenge, who is able to help or heal, who has which part of the
143 necklace and who is just plain scared to death (me). It is like the organi-
144 zational charts companies put out except that it includes things like hatred.
145 And magic of types I have never imagined (or cared to) before.  Each little
146 square in the chart in my head shimmers like the rocks in the Diamond Valley
147 and each has a cutting edge.=====>  And the other thing I don't like about this
148 place is the enemy.  We can cope with monsters, wizards, and demons, but
149 in this hard unfeeling place we are confronting a machine. I fear the slice
150 of its logic.    Now what??

152 Voyeur-Thanks for the compliment a couple of disks back.  Gaudy Minsky only
153 comes out for spy & detective stories.  So far.  My current character pur-

155 but bored to tears. (Points for grammar and spelling, but no jokes, folks)

161 *******************************kathy********************************************
162 to Gaudy M. Nice to see you again. We have missed your treasured input. Your
163 words of flowering wisdom, are greatly needed when the days are cold and dark
164 and wet. A good story is like a good fire: It warms the outer portions of the
165 body first, but eventually the warmth makes its way inward, for all of the
166 being to enjoy and take solace in. Please return with us on our great sojourn.
167 Is fantasy that much different than espionage? Can a division really be made?
168 Consider this a plea from a humble reader who has enjoyed your writing as
169 an escape from the drudgery of day to day existance.
170 I'll just sign my name as, 'Tooting someone else's horn'

172      The mini disk skimmed the surface of the earth, Ontho was relaxing
173 Iceland in about 1200 micros. Her first mission:  To investigate the strange
174 volcanic activity now growing more intense in Iceland. The elders had warned
175 her of their fears.  They belived the current erruptions were not caused by
176 mother nature but were being induced by an evil being.  Ontho had confirmed
177 the elders theories by closely studying the seismograph charts and not finding
178 the normal patterns.  So off they went.  The trident was in a special holder
179 at Leo's side.  It was glowing so brightly that Leo could see to write in her
180 new journal.
181      Entry One: Alex, Alex, (young duke) why the pained look when I gave you
182 my decistion to take this mission? You knew I was just dying to get out of
183 school, I want to prove to myself and the "others" that I am not a over-
184 confident punk with all kinds of rough edges. I'm ready for whatever happens
185 to me. Also I'm worried about Ontho, Inmo's are just not meant to be so 
186 damn smart!  Just last week the little tart was giving me theories and exp-
187 lanations on why inmo's were destined to be the rulers of the cosmos, can
188 you image something so bizarre?
189     Leo put away her journal and heard Ontho announce they would be arriving
190 in Iceland in less than 700 micros. Leo went back to her flight seat and
191 reclined. "Ill show them all!" she spoke outloud.
192     Ontho looked up at the outburst, which was not uncommon nowadays from
193 the human. She wasn't nearly as much fun as before the discovery of the
194 trident.  But time would cure that problem permantly. (heehh heehh)

264   The Former leaned tiredly over the maps and charts. Looking almost dead, he struck the table hard with his fist.
265   Taking the sextant and paper and pen in ahand he left the Chart Room for the Quarterdeck. Dodging the boom he went to the
266 railing.
267   While aligning the delicate mechanism of a sextant he muttered some things to himself. Trying to remember them better.
268   As he easily swept through all the steps, and equasions necessary. It seemed to him as if he had been doing this a thousand
269 years.
270   It stuck him how easily he had learned the arrangements of this ship. How he'd learned just the right ammount of bounce in
271 your step to guide you up the stairs in three bounces.
272   And the right ammount of powder to get a five pound ball thrown twenty leagues by six foot cannon.
273   All of it had come very easily to him, including how to kill a dying freind when death was better than life.
274 
275   The Former found the mistake in his equasions and finally knew the new course. Bellowing it to his mate, he went below.
276 
277   Marking his notes in the log, he penned the fleet code as if it was native to him. The Royal code MIGHT be native to him he
278 thought. He started thinking in it during an engagement with the French. Perhaps he needed a rest from the wars,  a calm day.
279 
280   At that very moment he decided to visit the inn once again, something he hadn't done in far to long. Since two lives, and
281 twenty thousand forgotten years.
282   He went to the quater deck and calibrated the sextant to indications which made absolutely no sense to anyone on the seas.
283   As the ship faded ever so slowly from view, he watched his mate, Llewelyn gasp. And some of the lower crew scream. #I will
284 return, Llewelyn, don't forget me...# said the Former.
285   Only completed in time before the leaves and dark green of the Inn's grounds faded in. The rowan was over there, and so was
286 the Innkeeper's horse, he might just be home after all.
287   Once solidified, he patted the sextant and congatulated it's workings for still doing their job after so long a time.
288   Sixteen paces to get to the entrance, and two more to get inside. Pam was here, as is evidenced by the Innkeeper's presence.
289   All drinks were seemingly at the expense of one patron, and as the Former lifted his tankard from the oaken bar, he thought
290 ho would have purchased it for him. And he did not know. But it was good rum, and watered just right for him. So the evening
291 proceeded. With no one recognizing the Formmer, which was odd. Damned odd.

317 Aaron: I'm not sure what his problem is with the monitor, but I think it might be he is disassembling at the wrong

319 L'homme: Nothing to say, your call says it all... thanks for the advice given.
320 Voyeur: So THAT's what those headbands stood for!  I was exposed to my first Buckaroo Banzai comic about a month ago,
321 much after the PorSFiS meeting in which the headbands abounded.
322 All interested in current story: May I find out exactly who you are?  Possible names right now are Piper, Leonard,

338 My force-knife chipped away at the sphere, sending bits flying into the void.  Another contraction of the sphere made
339 me increase the pace.  Damn!  It wasn't working... the sphere hardened faster than I chipped.  There must be some way,
340 there must!  I gave up supplying energy to the knife, and it faded out of existance.  The bubble returned to its former
341 transparent state, but still it contracted.  Time was running out.
342 Force had been futile.  I could not even hope to break the tough bubble.  Wait- perhaps burst it by filling it too much?
343 It was worth a try.  I began by composing a song... worked out thirty or so complex calculus problems... strained to
344 be creative and thoughtful and energetic, all those things this bubble was designed to contain.
345 Suddenly, I felt the bubble begin to fill with a liquid-like substance, originating from nowhere.  The bubble 
346 contracted once more, causing the level of the liquid to rise quickly....

351      The new clothes are serviceable, but the need to buy them simply
352 shouldn't have existed.  How could the airline have lost my bags?  The
353 plane wasn't going anywhere, it was as much a prisoner of circumstances as
354 I, so they couldn't have taken a detour through Outer Mongolia.  In fact,
355 the plane was still here and probably would be for some time since the
356 airline wouldn't let it into the air until the faulty engine was replaced.
357 There was no rush, no hurry, so there could be no excuses as far as I was
358 concerned.  But there is little sense in wasting vast amounts of mental and
359 emotional energy on something that is completely out of your hands, so I
360 left to find a local store where I could get a change of apparel, as well
361 as a toothbrush.   Having as personal posessions only the clothes on your
362 back can spoil your whole day.
363  
364      Tawny was reassigned to a new flight, and she left around noon the
365 next day.  We exchanged addresses and 'phone numbers, hugged each other,
366 cried, and made promises to keep in touch that I think we both knew would
367 never be kept.  We had so much fun!  Night spots, restaurants, even a
368 "singles" bar (an idea of that filled me with trepidation, but I surprised
369 myself by having fun despite the constant hits by men trolling for a catch)
370 on the one day and night we had together helped to cement an intimacy in
371 our relationship far beyond what I would have believed possible for so
372 short a time.  I found the perfect card in a small shop before she left:
373 two humorous cartoon lizards on the front, crying, and an interior that
374 read "Iguana miss you!"  And I do.
375  
376      When finally that afternoon I was informed that all arrangements had
377 been made for a new flight late that evening, and that my bags had been
378 found (they had somehow taken a side trip to Canada, don't ask me how) and
379 would meet me in Seattle, I thanked the agent and headed back to the hotel
380 room.  I didn't feel glad to be going home, or relieved that my belongings
381 had been recovered, or much of anything else; my entire trip had been an
382 emotional roller-coaster, and all I could feel was tired, numb, and
383 hung-over from the almost continuous intake of alchohol.
384  
385      Entering my room I flung off my clothes and dove into bed, hoping to
386 sleep for the rest of the afternoon in preparation for the next attempt at
387 a return home.  "What I really need," I told myself as I began to drift
388 off, "is a pair of ruby slippers."

392      Yes, an editor would be helpful, but as someone said, the nature of
393 the medium is such that one wouldn't really be practical.  Our work is here
394 for just a few days, then it dissapears into the vaults of the Innkeeper,
395 never to see the light of day again.  And I simply don't have the time to
396 devote to rewrites of these contributions.  Usually, I write what I enter
397 here in one sitting and then read it quickly for spelling and punctuation.
398 Other writings of mine (more personal, and more private) receive more
399 attention.
400      Of course, probably my biggest fear of an editor would be that they
401 would immediately spot those things that I DIDN'T say and question me about
402 them.  There are some things a person would prefer were left hidden away,
403 and a good editor would be too quick to grab them and force me to look at
404 (and perhaps include) them.
405  
406      Promethius, I'm glad to hear that you've read my recent entries.  And
407 don't worry, neither you nor your name have been forgotten.  I always
408 remember those at the Inn who show intelligence and a sense of humor, and I
409 hope you'll continue to drop in even if you don't plan to contribute, or be
410 "in the service of".  (Snicker!)
411  
412      My thanks to the Innkeeper!  Your aid in cleaning up the mess left by
413 a previous patron was greatly appreciated.  Would you join me in a warm
414 brandy?  Do you think there's room?

419    The piper had strange feelings of trepidation looking at the enigmatic
420 machine.  The meaningless words marched across the face of it, holding a slight
421 familiarity -- as though something seen long ago through different eyes.
422 He turned to his compainions and remarked "If any of you have connections 
423 with the NET, perhaps you could be of more help here than I, who  have no
424 aptitude for cryptography."
425   Stepping back to let the others crowd closer, the piper soon lost himself
426 in contemplation.  As he turned the facts of the situation over and over in
427 his mind, the raw feeling of loss increased.  The beating of great white wings
428 was engraved deeply into his heart, and the need to find his pegasus was 
429 nearly overpowering.

452 Bill:
453 
454      It's no joke. Carrol, John, Mike, Bob, and I took the four
455 wheel drive up to investigate. When we got to that clearing 
456 where we partied this summer we got stopped by three guys in 
457 suits. It was real strange cause they all wore suits, no boots,
458 and really looked out of place. It was real bizaare.
459      One of them asks us what we're doing out there. Mike tells
460 them we're just out driving. He says the bridge is out and we
461 have to go the other way. Mike says that with four wheel drive
462 we really don't care about the bridge. Then the guy gets mad, 
463 flashes a badge, and demands to see our ID. We show him, he 
464 writes down all our names, then tells us to get the hell out of
465 there.
466      We take off but try looping around that overgrown trail 
467 John's been wanting to explore anyway. We get about half a mile
468 when two other guys appear. They're wearing suits to but at 
469 least they have the sense to be wearing boots. One of them has
470 a thing plugged into his ear so we figure he's talking to one
471 of the clowns we met earlier. We got the hell out of there
472 fast.
473      We're thinking of going back but we want to have some kind
474 of a plan first. Keep in touch. This is getting interesting.

478  George,
479   I am very interrested in what happened to you guys. Because a similar incident happened to me, I wont go into it here but
480 I think they are covering up something very important or controversial.
481   Please leave me a message on the portland atari club bbs if you would like to discuss this further. adress it to OPUS.

487 With a questionable effort on the part of Hayes I am once again among the
488 modeming public. Bless UPS on this veterans day holiday. I see some familiar
489 borders have returned .... And others discreetly changed so they may continue
490 their " terminal " addictions unfetted by a previous reincarnation....And
491 still others whose fresh entrys do justice to the Inn. 
492 MiG,
493         Several weeks ago I was mailed some purulent garbage of a financial
494 nature....Would you know how I came by it ?....I feel we should meet sometime
495 this week...at the same old place...you pick the time & day. The outline 
496 is complete.
497 L'homme - voyeur & Leonard,
498         Played a new variation last weekend .... The addition of tactial

525 "I feel I should get back to Milchar" I said, not wanting the others to know about the pre-
526 monition I had had that morning.  "I will see you all in a few hours.  I knew that my death 
527 was planned.  I did not want any of them struck down with me.
528 Rather than heading back towards Milchar, I circled around behind the machine, a good distance
529 from it.  Clearing my mind, I began a probe of the insides of the machine, using techniques long
530 forgotten by most of our order.  I was able to see inside for only a short time before a cover
531 was thrown over the insides.  "What !?!?" I exclaimed.  I had never had anything of the sort
532 happen before.  Suddenly a wave of energy came in my direction, and the pain was unbearable.
533 I slipped quietly into unconciousness.

544 	Code! I hadn't seen any code in many months. Back when NET was after that Leroy McKane character. That
545 scum of the earth who tried every dirty trick in the book  to take over the world, and still came out on the
546 short end of the shtick. Code. Different, somehow... It was different from the NET code. It had four letter
547 groups, instead of five. And the clue at the top. Could that mean this code is some kind of offset code. Now the NET's
548 code was a substitution type, with an n-position substitution key. But this code could contain some kind of 
549 shifted letter value, and to decode it would be a simple procedure. Let's see...Hmmm.hmmm.hmmm...
550 A few moments later. Make that a few more moments later, I had it solved. "Hah!", I announced, to
551 no one in particular. "It's easy! All you have to do is be a little shifty!"
552 	"What! What does it say? What does it mean?", someone blurted out, the excitement ringing in their
553 voice. "Well... I don't know if I should tell you right away. Wouldn't you like some intellectual stimulation
554 yourself? Do you want to go through the rest of your life having other people figure out all the puzzles you are
555 going to encounter? I think everyone should solve this little puzzle for themselves. I think everyone will feel much
556 better for it." Ignoring the oaths directed towards me, I sat myself on the ground, and watched the others

575 I picked up a few old magazines at ORYCON this weekend & in one of them there
576 was a science article on COMPUTERS! The magazine was dated Feb 1951.
577 "... Work now going on in this field offers a hope that the problem can be solved
578 with machines that may reach a speed of ten thousand multiplications or one
579 ndred thousand additions a second."
580     Wow! Imagine that! Machines might someday operate at 10 kips! (snicker!)

584 Banzaiists: Shows are at Bagdad (SE 37th & Hawthorne [symbolic?]), Rose Moyer
585 (165th & Division),  Washington Square, and Clackamas Town Center. As I recall,
586 the best picture/sound is obtained at Rose Moyer & Clackamas.  Bagdad is 
587 most convenient for Leonard, Clack. for me, Wash. Sq for Marty, and Rose Moyer
588 for L'homme.  I *KNOW* Leonard has no hangups about wearing his headband,
589 so I will exhume mine.  The show STARTS playing on Friday, so there are later
590 possibilities if need be. The newspaper ad doesn't mention showtimes yet,
591 but we're all big people so we shouldn't have too much problem there.
592 L'homme: my NET skills must be slipping - I had no luck with Milchars code. I did try shifting, plus NET, so....
