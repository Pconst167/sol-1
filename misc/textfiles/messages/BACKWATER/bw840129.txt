21 Looking across the valley Tarn can almost make out the Inn at the
22 other side.  He had fully intended to take supper at the Inn this
23 night, but with his steed layed up once again he finds he must 
24 delay that prospect this time. Seeing a friend, he hails him and
25 asks for a ride to the stables. Upon arival at the stables, Tarn
26 seeks out the stablemaster to complain that the last steed he had
27 purchased had gone lame no more then 2 weeks after he had bought
28 it. The stablemaster explained that though he was sorry for the
29 most unfortunate circumstance, there was little he could do, but 
30 if Tarn would bring the poor beast in he would look at it and see
31 if it was his responsiblity to replace it. Exasperated Tarn trudges
32 bad down the road to collect the lame beast for the long walk back.
33 "That's what I get for not inspecting the animal myself!" he curses
34 to himself. "I wonder if Emer was there? I guess I'll never know."

41 GARY:  GOOD QUESTIONS.  THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE LUNAR MINING
42 STATION DOES REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF DIVERSE TALENTS TO ACCOMPLISH.  THE
43 FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, HOWEVER IS MONEY.  I AM FORMING A MAINFRAME
44 COMPUTER COMPANY WHICH HAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD CHANCE OF MAKING IT
45 TO THE $50-100 MILLION DOLLAR MARK.  AT THAT POINT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
46 TO CONVERT TO A NON-PROFIT FOUNDATION TO FUND THE MINING STATION.  IT
47 IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT WITH VOLUENTEER LABOR (DID I SPELL THAT RIGHT?)
48 AN EARTH ORBIT TO LUNAR SURFACE CRAFT COULD BE CONSTRUCTED, AND SHUTTLED
49 INTO EARTH ORBIT.  A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE INTO
50 MINIMIZING WHAT MUST BE LIFTED, FOR INSTANCE LUNAR SOIL IS ABOUT 40%
51 OXYGEN, 15% IRON, ALUMINUM,SILICON, ETC.  GLASS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT
52 BUILDING MATERIAL, AND SMELTING WOULD REQUIRE ONLY SOLAR ENERGY
53 FURNACES.  HYDROGEN WOULD BE THE ONLY MAJOR REQUIREMENT, AND FOR EACH
54 TON OF HYDROGEN LIFTED, IT YIELDS 9 TONS OF WATER.  SHUTTLE SPACE
55 WOULD BE CHEAP AFTER THE INITIAL LIFT, SINCE WE COULD TAKE UP LEFTOVER
56 SPACE FOR CONSUMABLES AND PERSONNEL.  SMELTED MATERIALS WOULD BE SOLD
57 AT COST AND DROPPED INTO ORBITAL POSITIONS TO ANY ORGANIZATIONS 
58 THAT COULD GET IN GEAR TO USE THEM.  IT IS TOO BAD LUNAR LIVING
59 IS IMPRACTICAL, BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE MINING OPERATION IS A NECESSARY
60 FIRST STEP DUE TO THE COST OF LIFTING MATERIALS.

79 To Gary and the General:
80     I am interested in this Lunar operation which you speak of. For
81 years I have pondored about the ideas of similar nature. I would 
82 also like to see what we could do with some of the materials that
83 are considered "useless."

90 my measure of revenge on the people who are responsible? I will

111 The walk is long, and the forest fills me with dread.  Yet I
112 must walk the path to reach my end.  A friend has once
113 passed this way, yet there is no trace.  I wonder which
114 direction it was?  Try as I might, I can find no spore to
115 follow and now I find I am lost.  To be lost in this dark
116 forest!  A most fearful thing indeed!  If only I knew the
117 way out back into the sunlight glade.  The fearful cries
118 and sowerful moans that premeat this place leave me shivering
119 with great fear.  Looking around I see no help, and it causes
120 me to strech out my arms and cry, "Do not leave me here to die!"

217 Hi inspector!
218    This is the Ninja. Yes, I am still dead - you even saw my body. But, I'm
219 getting bored being dead. I suppose I shouldn't be bothering you since you
220 killed me fair and square, but if I have to play another game of Go with that
221 warlord I'm going to scream. (Go is a new game to me but it gets old fast.)

225 Aha! Someone answers my challenge. Let me ask you something oh Bard, who
226 subjects us to songs of drivel and questionable value, I can live with
227 your ridicule, but can you live with DEATH? And anyway, who said anything
228 about killing? When a city dweller speaks of revenge, it isn't always 
229 revenge in its most supreme form, and to top that off, I AM NOT from that
230 great city New York, where revenge by death is common place. My idea of
231 revenge is to put the victim in at least the same amount of discomfort I
232 myself was put through. I think you assumed revenge equated murder, and
233 since my biggest injury was to my ego and pride, that is all I would do
234 to my `victim'. Fair enough?

267      I  spent many hours runing through the dark forest,  only to 
268 find  that I had gotten myself deeper and deeper into  its  depth 
269 and darkness, until I came to the point where I found a sign that 
270 read;  "Do not enter!  Once you have passed beyond this point you 
271 will never be able to return!"
272      Looking  deep  within the forest beyond the  sign,  I  found 
273 nothing but darkness,  as if all light were being sucked from the 
274 very  air.   After considerable thought upon this and the message 
275 the sign had to foretell,  I decided to take head of its  warning 
276 and turning towards the portion of the dark forest that seemed to 
277 have  the most light,  I began my long journey back.  Not knowing 
278 how  long  it would take,  or if I would survive  the  trek.  Yet 
279 determined to find my way back to the sunlight glade once more.

345 ...T.P.W.E.B. (cont.)
346 
347      "Thank you.", said Nila, "What are the other rules of my search?"
348      "There are no rules to your search, beautiful princess."
349      Nila was sure she heard a twinkle of laughter from his strings.
350      "You confuse me, sir.", Nila said, "And I think you are joking
351      with me. You just said a rule of my search is the answer is in
352      the question. Now you say there are no rules. Which is true?"
353      "Both", said the ragged man, "and neither. In calling it a rule
354      you brought the rule into being. But as for me I know no rules,
355      except...", and here his fingers brushed the strings setting
356      the air to shimmering, "...the rule of perfect Harmony."
357      "Please sir!", Nila said, "don't confuse me any more. My head
358      is just swimming."
359      "My dear", the musician said softly, "it is you who confuse
360      yourself. Please do not look outside yourself for something
361      that lies only within."
362      "I am sorry", Nila said, "I didn't mean to blame you or
363      anything. It's just that you make everything turn into its
364      opposites. Questions turn into answers. Rules are no rules
365      and I don't know what all." Nila frankly was beginning to 
366      pout just a bit. They sat quietly under the tree, the
367      musician absorbed in his music, Nila in her thoughts.
368  
369      "In my country", the musician said, "there are no opposites.
370      no up and down, no hot and cold, no left and right, no black
371      and white, no good and bad, no out and in, no coming and going."
372      "Well good heavens!", said Nila, "How do you get around and
373      tell what things are then?"
374      "Oh, it just comes in the natural course of events.", the
375      musician said, "In the country I come from."
376      "Well", said Nila, "I wish you could tell me something that
377      doesn't just twist around on itself like that."
378      "I have already told you all you needed to know.", the
379      ragged musician said, "But for your beauty and wisdom I will
380      tell you one more thing. I will tell you precisely where
381      Truth is located, though you must search it out for yourself."
382      "Please do", Nila said, "I do so much prefer traveling to
383      thinking and I am tired of riddles and opposites."
384      "Truth", he said, brushing the strings with his finger tips,
385      "is concealed in the very place where east begins."
386      "Then I shall go and find it.", Nila cried happily. She ran
387      quickly from the garden to begin preparing for her journey.
388      When she realized she had not thanked the ragged musician
389      for his instruction, she ran back as quickly as she could
390      to the great tree, but he was gone.
391      In the high branches there was the remembrance of a sound.
392      The sound of bees seeking nectar.

397 JOHNATHAN: The eye surgery you speak of does not cure all eye disorders,
398 but is most effective on nearsightedness.  Tens of thousands of experimental
399 cases were tried before it was allowed for the general public some months
400 ago.  The Eugene Eye Clinic (I think that was them) has performed hundreds
401 of operations so far without a hitch, at a cost of about $950 per eye.
402 I don't believe any hospital stay is required.  I have some info since I
403 was considering having it done, and went to extended wear contacts instead,
404 mostly because it was cheaper.  The procedure is to cut tiny radial
405 incisions in the cornea to reshape the surface to compensate for the
406 nearsighted error in the lens.  The cuts are determined by computer,
407 but perfomed by the surgeon.  Since there is obviously some margin for
408 error, perfect vision is NOT guaranteed, but in most cases is achieved.
409 I hope I remembered all of the above correctly.  Anyone feel free to
410 correct me if I slipped.  I also recommend checking with the health
411 sciences people, they're your eyes.

418      Sergei was having trouble keeping the muzzle of the Uzi hidden
419 under his robes as he slowly threaded his way through the throngs
420 of accolytes toward the stage.  A sea of pomegranite and peuce robed
421 figures seemed to sway with its own rhythms under the spell of their
422 leader, leading the slowly building chant from the enormous tower
423 of loudspeakers on the stage, only a dozen yards or so now in front
424 of him at the edge of the field.  As the chanting grew more intense,
425 white robed novices began to frantically down tall bottles of ginger
426 ale, hoping to be worthy when the moment came.
427      He knew he'd only get one shot at it.  McKane, his golden robes
428 of the Master flowing about him, began to lead the writing crowd to
429 their feet, moaning and swaying, bellies distended after a week of
430 preparation by their Master.  He was close enough now.  He could
431 see the fanatic look in McKane's eyes, a look he recognized in himself
432 all too often lately, but it had to be done.   He jumped up onto a 
433 stump in the field, and raised the Uzi to fire.
434      "This one's for Phillipe!" he screamed, but just then McKane's
435 arms dropped, and the roar of a thousand perfect primal belches in
436 unison, in an orgy of perfectly tuned percussion, assaulted his ears
437 and he knew no more...

440 OKKKK! Here's what is happening, gang.   Saturday evening, show
441 up here (21845 SW York, Aloha, off TV hwy at 219th) between 6 and
442 6:30 so we can pool rides down to the tubes.  Anyone who wants to
443 meet us at the tubes, may be able to find us but it's not likely
444 since none of us knows who we are, right?  Dead body would be a good
445 giveaway, though. Good thinking.  Just look for the most unlikely
446 grouping of people and yell Backwater.  With an hour at the tubes
447 we should be back at my place at 8:30.  Anything you might bring
448 is of course, welcome.  I'll have some light bevs and snacks, but
449 chips, and your favorite drink that I might not have...you get the
450 idea.  If you have any favorite tapes, bring them, too.  Then
451 we can get down to the serious work at hand.
452 ***Only one caveat:  If you drink, PLEASE don't drive.  Make plans
453 ahead of time, there's plenty of room to sack out here, also, if need be.
454 
455 See you tomorrow!

462 Vlainor:
463    Thank you for the info on my murderer. I could not see the attacker when
464 the bullet hit the bone. My honor has been disturbed. I can not rest until I
465 have given this Sergei an unhonorable death worthy of the coward he is.

469      A long trip, and one that took more time  than  I  had  planned  on,
470 but now it is over and I am back in the  land  that  I've  loved  for  so
471 long.
472      As I wander slowly (for I am very worn from my travels)  toward  the
473 Inn, I sense a mind calling out in fear from the forest to my  left,  and
474 the pain present there is a familiar one. With vigor  renewed,  I  charge
475 into the forest, ignoring the brambles that tear at my  clothes  and  rip
476 my skin. Tarn, you foolish creature, why  have  you  trodden  this  path?
477 Did you think that I might have taken this way, and attempted  to  follow
478 me? Were you following another from the Inn  who  was  missing,  and  did
479 indeed take this path in seeking her destiny? She  may  return  in  time,
480 if the way is set and she finds what she seeks.
481      Damn! My new jerkin  is  ruined!  If  I  find  Tarn,  I  don't  know
482 whether I'll guide him back to the road or kick him in the  seat  of  his
483 britches! I wish he could  remain  in  better  humour,  for  I  certainly
484 can't always be there to guide him out of his dark moods.
485      The forest has turned very dark and forbidding, the limbs  of  trees
486 and tangling undergrowth grasping at me  hungrily  to  slow  my  headlong
487 flight. Passing one particularly large tree, I suddenly come  upon  Tarn.
488 Now I realize that what I first thought to be  anger  is  really  concern
489 for my friend, and mere irritation over the loss of my new jerkin  in  my
490 haste to arrive. Placing my hand upon his shoulder, I  speak  kind  words
491 of friendship and attempt to soothe his troubled heart. Come,  Tarn,  let
492 us return to the Inn, and perhaps you will return to  a  more  optimistic
493 view of the world and yourself.

497 Dear Lt. Salazar:
498 I trust you received the eight hundred thousand dollars from 
499 Myrddin Emrys; it will, I assume, cover the cost of closing 
500 the Natasha McKane murder case.
501 
502 I'd appreciate it if you'd also pay Contremon Valerius for 
503 the public relations campaign he's doing to make me appear 
504 a respected religious leader. A hundred thousand ought to do it.
505 
506 I felt real bad about my sisters murder. 
507 
508 As you know, Natasha and I were separated as infants. We 
509 weren't reunited until we were in our early twenties. What a 
510 surprisingly passionate reunion that was. 
511 
512 Too bad I had to kill her. It wasn't my fault that she was 
513 blackmailing half the United Nations diplomats. I really 
514 didn't want to do it, you know, but they offered so much money.
515 
516 With the Andropov deal falling through, and Serena on the way, 
517 I just couldn't pass up the opportunity. It was just too good 
518 of a deal. Natasha would have understood. 
519 
520 Business is business, after all.
521 
522 About the Andropov thing. Boy did that get screwed up. I 
523 knew Russia was run by a committee but I over-estimated how 
524 important Andropov was to them. He's just window dressing. 
525 
526 Before I even got a chance to pull off the switched identity 
527 scam they beat me to it. It seems the KGB already had three
528 Andropov clones trained, outfitted, and ready to go. What a pit.
529 
530 If it weren't for the Natasha money, and the front money from 
531 the solidarity union for the Andropov scam, I'd be real 
532 strapped for cash. Fortunately I had more than one iron in the fire.
533 
534 Speaking of hot irons, have you heard from Petrov lately? I 
535 need a trim.

538 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
539 NINJA: NO, No, no....you got it all wrong.  I can figure that you
540 wouldn't have gotten it right, after all, you were dead. but the
541 rest of you... There was a tinkle of glass at the last bullet, and
542 Sergei was down with your knives in his arms.  Phillipe had you in
543 his rifle scope from a building across the street.  Boy, sometimes
544 ...Phillipe, however, has been poisoned, I hear.  Heh. heh.  CVal.
545 I THINK I LIKE THE IBM PC BETTER THEN THE SANYO PC, AT LEAST IT DOESN'T SEEM 
546  HAVE AS MANY BUGS IN IT AS THE SANYO. OF COURSE IT HAS A NASTY PROBLEM WITH
547 THE BELL, IT 'GOES AWAY' FOR ABOUT A SECOND WHEN IT RINGS THE STUPID BELL
548 WHICH IS VERY DISCONCERTING IF YOUR ARE WATCHING WHAT YOU TYPE AND THE BELL
549 IS USED TO LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE NEAR A MARGIN (LIKE BW). MAYBE THE 
550 IDIOTS WHO DESIGNED THE THINK DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TYPE, AND JUST USED THE HUNT
551 AND PECK METHODE WHERE IT DOESN'T BOTHER MUCH SINCE THEY DON'T USUALLY LOOK
552 AT THE SCREEN AND WOULDN'T NOTICE A LITTLE THING LIKE CHARACTERS NOT SHOWING
553 UP. OTHER THEN THAT AND THE FACT THAT WORDSTAR IS SLOWER THEN A SLUG IN
554 WINTER ON THE BEAST, IT AIN'T TOO BAD, THOUGH I LIKE MY NICE SPEEDY CPM
555 SYSTEM BEST WITH IT'S NICE FAST RAM DISK, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY...

558 Running once more to try to get out of this dark forest before
559 the night closes in on me to leave me forever stranded in this
560 most fearful place.  I watch the ground so that I will not 
561 trip and fall over some root or small bush.  Then all of the
562 sudden a figure looms before me. Too late to notice and I
563 am unable to stop. I crash into this figure who has suddenly 
564 appeared in my path. Then looking up I see it is Emer!  Out of
565 breath and paniced I cling to her and bable incoherently of my
566 fear. "I thought you had left, and I came searching for you,
567 but in my foolishness I found I had achieved nought but my
568 own foolish ability to loose myself in the darkness of the 
569 forest. I know that I was foolish in this, can you but forgive
570 me for this worry of mine?  Your tunic! It is torn! Oh dear,
571 did you really care that much that you would ruin your beautiful
572 tunic to come find me? I don`t know what to say. How can I ever
573 repay you for such kindness and concern? Come, do you knw the 
574 way out of this dank place? For I fear of staying here to long
575 or we may both be lost to its clutches."

591      Salazar scanned the letter from McKane.  As he read, his bafflement
592 of the Natasha murder case cleared.  A deep, searing anger filled the void.
593 He knew his task was not finished and that he would once again be plunged
594 into danger.  The Inspector stabbed at his intercom, growling at his 
595 assistant; "Pull out the file on the Natasha murder case.  That <Expletive
596 Deleted> McKane was behind the whole thing."  He then picked up the attache
597 case and started for the bank.  Even Salazar won't refuse 800 grand.
