28 Ahhh.... Backwater is free to me at last...
29 To all present at the PorSciFiS meeting:Gee, my expectations were dashed to bits.
30 I was expecting flashy cloaks, strange instuments, and Quizmaster.  Zero on 
31 all three accounts.  Oh, well.  
32 By the way, when something is said about a Commodore 64, you are referring to
33 my system... (paid for in blood).

35 Dragging Milchar on further, The Doctor finally brings him to a thatched roof
36 hut of some small proportions.  Milchar stirs, and opens his eyes.  "Place 
37 me inside...G-Go find some vibranite...bring it here."  The Doctor carries 
38 Milchar the rest of the way into the nearly empty hut, and posts K-9 inside
39 as a guard.  Milchar gestures with the last of his strength, and a green glow
40 permeates the entire hut, sealing it
41 off.  Milchar slips into a deep sleep, waiting The Doctor's return...

60 So if high-tech wasn't the answer, maybe low-tech was. It hadn't been easy for Billy-Bob to set up his latest
61 trick, but he'd managed to pull it together in record time. Now they were all in position for the attack. Billy-
62 Bob stood bravely behind a convenient tree as he gave the full-throated cry of the Zulu warrior. On that signal, 
63 twelve hundred painted warriors rose from the tall grass and stepped from the woods around the hapless party. 
64 First a hail of spears was loosed at the party clustered about the car, then, moving as one, the howling tribesmen
65 converged on the car. Maybe I overdid it a little, thought Billy-Bob as he watched the hundreds of naked warriors
66 stumbling over each other, each trying to get to the center of the circle. But they had such a great group
67 discount rate!
68               && The Mad Actor &&
69 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::O O:::::::::::::::::::::::O O:::::::::::::
70 voyeur was laying in the grass, soaking up the sun while recuperating from the 
71 splitting headache gained as a result of moving the car. From what he had
72 heard from the bard and L'homme, the hydrogen was quite flammable, as well as
73 being very light.  Something had been mentioned about a balloon and germ warfare,
74 but voyeur wasn't really up on such things.  
75 "I wonder if L'homme has any more of those mints?  They're good, and I seem to
76 have worked up quite an appetite."
77 Suddenly the grass around them erupted with what seemed like thousands of
78 near-naked painted savages.  Spears fell all around, luckely striking no one.
79 Not being one accustomed to fighting, voyeur was unsure what to do.  Then he had a 
80 thought.  Retrieving the hydrogen tank from where it had been stashed, he used what
81 little 'magic' he had left from Amber to ignite a flame, while he cracked the valve
82 on the tank.  A terrific flame roared from the nozzle of the cylinder.
83 He turned to meet the attackers, flame thrower in hand.
84 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::O O:::::::::voyeur:::::::::::O O::::::::::::
85 && && &&
86 Billy-Bob Bullyboy blinked & backed as the blossom of flame bloomed before him. Two dozen Zulus were barbecued in 
87 the first blast, but as voyeur turned to bring the flame to bear on another flank the tank of gas exploded. 
88 The fragments of the tank tore voyeur to shreds. Burning globs of liquid hydrogen were thrown hundreds of meters
89 away. Well, thought Billy-Bob, at least it'll take him a while to walk back from THAT reality. Too bad that
90 reality-hoppers so seldom find death more than an inconvienience. Better report in on this one...
91 "Shadowspawn-1 to Shadow Uncast. One is out. Hope to report more later. Off."

94 HEY!!  You weren't supposed to kill ME!!!
95 Let's see, Corwin told me about his eyes, and told me I had some Amber blood.
96 Now, how long did it take him to regrow his eyes?  As I dowbt the animals
97 hereabouts will refuse even fried long pork, I hope my companions remember to
98 gather my remains when they leave.  In this scattered form, it will be difficult
99 enought to encourage my regeneration, without wasting energy chasing away the jackals.

102 Don't give up, Voyeur! (did you ever have a day when nothing went right???????)
103 Satisfied with the protection spell, Milchar send out his soul-self to observe the progress of others.  He had hoped
104 That they had all bypassed the traps of their captor, but deep down he felt that something was wrong.
105 Putting forth his will, Milchar's soul-self slid between the realities, as he was a point in space, not matter.  
106 Realities shuffled before him like a deck of cards, Milchar chose one.  Land sped by him as he travelled to what he
107 sought...  He had found a car, now dented with hundreds of sprear marks and one tire punctured, defended by three...
108 oh! TWO men now, why do people play with fire after their mothers tell them not to?  Rushing to Voyeur's side, Milchar's
109 soul-self went to see how extensive the damage was.  He was just barely conscious, and he turned his head and saw 
110 Milchar's soul-self there.  A thin smile formed on his lips, and then the weak words, "I'm not down yet."
111 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Milchar (120 columns is fun!) +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
112 As the attack began bard had just completed the hookup on the main panel.
113 Realizing that something had to be done quickly he flicked on his neutralizer 
114 and then activated the Stasis unit. The charge in the panel would only last for 
115 a few minutes, but hopefully that would suffice.
116 To bard's eyes all the light had shifted rather drasticly towards the red.
117 All motion was at a standstill. Moving with great care so as to avoid damging
118 anything, he stepped out of the car. What WAS that strange shimmer by voyeur? 
119 Well, no matter, first he'd get voyeur taken care of then he'd worry about 
120 erything else!
121 He picked up voyeur's remains carefully & carried them over to his pack.
122 Opening a hitherto unnoticed seam, he revealed an opening that was somehow as 
123 large as a good sized door! He then carried the remains thru the opening. Inside
124 the pack, he placed the remains in the autodoc & set a field generator around 
125 it. There!
126 Exiting the pack, he carried an Atchisson assualt shotgun & a long, 
127 sharp knife. They would pay for this! He glanced at his wrist to check the 
128 neutralizer. Good, there were a couple of minutes before the field dropped.
129 He proceeded to cut the throats of the nearest warriors. At -30 seconds
130 he returned to the car, having slain all the warriors within 10 feet. He 
131 sheathed the knife & reached back to turn off the console.
132 Normal time resumed. He waited a moment to allow the bodies to fall.
133 Then as the shock hit the survivors he started firing... the Atchisson roared
134 spewing forth death in all directions. In 30 seconds he had emptied the 12 round
135 magazine & the warriors were in full retreat.
136 He placed a fresh magazine in the shotgun & handed it to L'homme. "Keep 
137 a lookout while I finish the hookup," he paused, "Oh, remind me to get voyeur 
138 out of the autodoc in ten minutes."
139 "What autodoc? What the hell is going on?!" shouted L'homme.
140 "I'll explain later, just keep a good lookout. OK?"

145 The Doctor's Pockets (words: Anne Wilson & Meg Garrett, music: My Favorite Things)
146 Jack knife and yo-yo and things I find handy,
147 Grubby white bag full of bright colored candy,
148 My sonic screwdriver and bugs I have found,
149 These are the things that I carry around!
150 Chorus:When they caught me,
151 And they searched me,
152 This is what they found --
153 My captors were simply amazed to behold
154 The things that I carry around!
155 Half-eaten apples and wires and gears,
156 A diary with entries for five hundred years,
157 Etheric detector and string wrapped around,
158 These are the things that I carry around!
159 CHORUS
160 Hypnotic crystal and hanky with knot in,
161 Ginger-pop bottle and things I've forgotten,
162 Toffee tin, spyglass, and stray British pound,

166 Oh, by the way, if any of you were wondering why the Doctor's scarf is
167 black & white instead of the usual multi-color, it's really quite simple. You

173 "Friend Green Eyes, wouldst thou be so kind as to guard the door whilst
174 we prepare some food and plan?" inquired the apprentice. The cat sent a feeling 
175 of hunger, as if to say "I'm hungry too!" but lay down just inside the doorway.
176 "Fear not, we shall not forget to feed thee!" With this he turned to the 
177 innkeeper and placed orders. Shortly they were delivered and they began to plan.

277 I WONDER
278 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
279 First off, I'd like to congratulate Hawthorne.  He truly is a 'Trekkie'.  He got
280 ALL the Constitution Class ships in the Federation.  Yet, he was slightly off
281 on the question about the matter/anti-matter.  He said that the ratio was 
282 1.154678:1.  Actually it is 1.164653:1.  That little mistake could, though, 
283 cause an imbalance in the Warp Engines. 
284 ????????????
285 Bard:  Thank you for the poem.  I really enjoyed it.
286 ????????????
287 Another Trek question:  What model of ship is the Federation Class ships, and
288 what is the name and number of all 20 of them?
289 ????????????
290 I would write some more on the continuing adventure, but I have to go.
291 
292 ?????????????????????????????????????????? The Doctor ??????????????????????????
293 Everybody i have a quiz a trek quiz that is....Rhym!!
294 Well what show did Dr.Macoy say Hell in?
295 Also what is the name of the ship that Was on the planet with Kahn with KECKOV 
296           And the other commander?
297 Awnser
298        Remember THY POWER IS IN THY SWORD!!*
299 LORD OF GRADSKAN**
300 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
301 Lord of Grandskan:  Are you refering to the Reliant in Star Trek II:The Wrath
302 I'm not too sure about the Dr. McCoy question, but I'm working on it!!!!!!!!!!!
303 Here's another to keep you busy.  Who was Kirk's instructor at the Starfleet 
304 Acadamy????  (I think I got ya all with this one!!!)
305

322 Good, Milchar thought to himself.  That was a clever device, the stasis-thrower.
323 Bard is having a wonderful time...  Hey! What is that?, Milchar thought again.  A speck of darkness against the sun 
324 attracted his attention.  "It can't be!  That's a Dralasite upon an anti-grav sled!  The Shadows certainly are throwing
325 out strange things these days.  What??  He can see me??" ##Yes, and think more softly.  I am getting a mind-ache from
326 your thinking.  Well, now.  You look like a 'tweenman.  How did you get in that condition?##  "Well...",and Milchar 
327 fills him in on all the details, pouring out information as fast as he could, and the short being (he rather looked
328 like a ball of Silly-Putty) absorbed it all.  ##Are your friends all right?  Do they need immediate help?##  "No,
329 they repelled the attack.  What is really needed is some Vibranite, a mineral that I can use to revitalize my mortal
330 body faster than usual.  At the present rate, it will recover in about a week."  ##Vibranite...I thought that I 
331 detected some a few kilometers back.  Just a moment## and he was gone, zooming off into the distance.  Five minutes
332 later, the sled was again in sight.  ##Pretty low-grade ore, but it shall suffice.  Now, where did you say you left 
333 you body?  Oh, I almost forgot.  Let me introduce myself- my name's Gizmo.##
334 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Milchar & Gizmo ++++++++++++++++++++
335 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
336 The Doctor was wandering around the outskirts of the village in search of 
337 some Vibranium for the ailing Milchar, when he glanced up into the sky and lo
338 and behold-There's a Dralasite up there.  Oh well, he muttered under his breath
339 and took off again.  About 150 yards from the spot where he saw the Dralasite,
340 The Doctor spied a crashed Hovercycle over by a rather tall tree.  Laying 
341 beside the wreck, was a wounded Yazarian.  The Doctor sensing that he needed
342 medical attention, pulled out his portasable Quatrophenalatrizen (It means that
343 it's a cure-all device) producing gadget.  Turning the dial to maximum, it 
344 emmited a purplish beam of light.  After a few moments, the Yazarian stood up,
345 and said that he was weak, but felt a lot better than he did a few minutes ago.
346 The Doctor then introduced himself as a Time-Lord of Gallefrey.  The Yazarian
347 said that his name was dfjfkdfhfjhf (Pronounced 'Psycho').  Each had heard of
348 the other's reputation-with Psycho known as the sneakiest inter-pangalactic
349 theif around.  The Doctor then remembered that he was looking for Vibranium 
350 for Milchar.  Psycho looked through the debris that had been his hovercycle,
351 and declared that he had about 10 kg of the stuff as well as enough Tornadium
352 D-19 left to destroy Chicago.  With that thought in mind the two walked back
353 to the hut where Milchar lay resting.  When they arrived, they were not 
354 
355 suprised to see the Dralasite known as Gizmo.
356 
357 ?????????????????????????????????????????? The Doctor & Psycho ?????????????????
358 L`Homme S.P.Sorry about the double spacing, it seems that the new super
359 whiz-bang modem program ignores excess line feeds, so turbo looked OK to
360 me, but unfortunately the thing also adds line feeds "when necessary", even
361 when told not to. Sorry about that, should always look at sokething two ways,
362 one never knows what is real here, and what is????????
363 ////////////////////////////BAD\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
364 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
365 The Vibranite assembled near Milchar's body pulsed and grew warm in the hands of those who held it.  Presently, the 
366 semi-magical stones floated about the room, and finally settled on a dusty table quite near the cot.  Milchar's soul-
367 self merged with his body, which commenced emitting a rainbow aura about him.  The whole hut vibrates with the power
368 held within.... then all is quiet.  Milchar opens his eyes and says, "I always did like showy entrances.  Well, that

370 also.  Doctor, I have bestowed so many compliments on you previously that I won't give you more, even if you deserve
371 them.  Now, on with the journey.  Will you two gjoin us in this little trip?  There's a fight brewing, and I think 
372 that neither of you would like to miss it.  ##Fine with me##, thinks Gizmo.  "Gokis ldain sdsod!", says Psycho. 
373 (Translation from Yazari:"Count me in!")  "Then off we go.  Doctor, it is your turn to suppy the transport.  I still
374 must rest further, and we must make wo more trips..."

377 The Zulu attack had seemed to die down, thanks to more of Bard's Gizmos, and some accurate shooting on the part of
378 Bard and Myself. I never thought I would use the sharp shooting skills I learned in high school, but sure enough, they
379 came in handy. It's pretty hard to miss with a shotgun though. In addition, I used a little electronics knowledge
380 myself, and hooked up a Commodore 64 I found in the trunk directly to the car battery. I had found some time ago while
381 cruising 82nd back in Portland, that under certain conditions, the Commodore 64 emitted severe high frequency sound
382 that rendered anyone nearby helpless, unless they were wearing special headsets, which I distributed to Bard, myself,
383 and what was left of voyeur's battered head. That, along with the stasis field, should keep us healthy for awile.
384 "Bard...Will voyeur be OK???", I asked. "After this healing process finishes, he won't be in the best of health
385 for awhile, but he will be alive, and he will get better.", Bard replied, still busy hooking
386 stuff up to the car. "As Obi-Wan Kenobi said in Star Wars...`We better get inside. The Zulus are easily frightened, but
387 they will soon by back, and in greater numbers.' In other words...let's get OUT of here as soon as possible!"
388 "Soon L'homme...soon...We can't move until voyeur is better, and I still have some equipment to hook up. You don't want
389 anymore damage to your car or yourself do you???" Bard replied. "Ok! Ok! But HURRY! No telling what else this evil perso
390 n who is doing all of this to us has in store." Suddenly, a groan from within the healing chamber caused Bard and 
391 myself to dash to the source. It was impossible, but it was true. I couldn't believe my eyes. Bard stood in equal dis-
392 belief..."I have never seen anything like this before", muttered Bard to no one in particular...

430 voyeur lay on the field, while battle raged on around him.  He didn't really see much of it, though, as he was trying to 
431 concentrate on maintaining his life-force in the 'normal' plane. But while so occupied, he felt a presence, which identified
432 itself as Milchar.  It was shimmering, insubstantial, a spirit?
433 # Have I lost the battle to exist?# he thought to Milchar. # you appear in the form usually associated with near-death 
434 experiences #.  Milchar started to explain his astral projection so as to reassure voyeur, when the bard, moving at lightning
435 speed, suddenly arrived and picked up voyeur, and voyeur, and voyeur, and....  and stuffed the mess (somewhere.  voyeur 
436 was concentrating his energy to the exclusion of almost all outside stimuli.  He could tell the bard was doing something,
437 but he couldn't spare the attention to find out what.)  Suddenly his being was suffused with an almost unbearable tingling.
438 The energy he was focusing on his mangled body was magnified a hundredfold.  He could FEEL his body regenerate at a rapid
439 pace.  He couldn't understand it, but he took advantage of it while it lasted.  Finally the flow tapered off, and he started
440 to feel more normal. Huh? He FELT!  He explored his body.  Everything seemed to be as it should be.  He felt weak, but HEY!
441 Who's complaining?  As he started to explore his surroundings (some sort of cabinet.  A coffin?) the lid pulled back.  
442 L'homme and the bard looked in, shock obvious on their faces.
443 "Tennis, anyone?" voyeur asked weakly.

460 
461 ................................................................................
462 At the sounds from within the 'doc, Bard hurried over. As the lid opened
463 voyeur attempted to say something. Due to the accelerator field it came out 
464 rather garbled ("Ts an". He switched off the field & helped voyeur out.
465 "I expected you to heal fast, but this is a bit much! Well, get in
466 the car. I've got everything hooked up." So saying he began to stow things in 
467 pack. He did something (none of the others could quite agree on what) and the 
468 "doorway" vanished. He was holding a pack again.
469 A noise caused them all to turn. Quickly, Bard spoke " Don't shoot! It's
470 a friend!" #That is you Dreamtouch, isn't it?#
471 After a BRIEF round of introductions, they were all in the car. Bard
472 & L'homme in front, the others in back. Bard instructed L'homme to drive down 
473 road.
474 "What road?"
475 "Oops, sorry." The scenery flickered. They were now on adirt road.
476 "We'll be traveling in short hops. I need the power from the engine, but we 
477 can't carry all that much air along. The purifier can handle the air INSIDE the
478 car, but the engine is going to need fresh air pretty often!"
479 So they set off down the road. Soon a rhythm had been established. 
480 Ten minutes of transposition & ten minutes of straight driving. During 
481 transposition, driving required great care. Unlike voyeur's Shadow walking,
482 they had to progress in a more or less regular sequence from one line to the
483 next. Thus, while the major features of the landscape varied slowly, the road 
484 tended to drift. Trees, bushes, and the like became blurs the seemed to shift at
485 random. And the weather... the less said about the way IT varied from moment to 
486 moment, the better!

489 On your terminal it may be difficult to distinguish the two!
490 ALLSEER: Dreamtoucher is using a terminal I loaned him. It is NOT a C-64. Feel
491 free to make another guess. (by the way his initials are JT)
492 ALL: No fair giving hints if you were here when I loaned the terminal!

494 MIG: I have a song for Greymalkin, but in accordance with established policy
495 (mine) it will have to wait for the next disk.
496 L'homme: Be sure to let me know when we get down to about 1/4 tank. I can 
497 vector us to "service stations" but need LOTS of advance warning. (ps. They DO
498 sell gasoline and they WILL accept our money, beyond that- no guarantees. Last
499 time I did this, we stopped at a place that had a wooden stockade to keep the
500 brontosaurs, &c out!)

508 have a spell for removing cat hair from garments do you Apprentice, or 
509 you Greymalkin? No, well maybe the innkeeper has a drycleaning spell. With
510 wry grin Whisper turns and heads towards the back of the inn and the Roman
511 baths. As she sheds her cloths and lowers herself into the steaming water,
512 she takes care to make sure her weapons are handy.

537   GREETINGS FROM LORD CHARLES MORBY, THE EARL OF BLACKPOOL...
538    Have you found me out?  I suppose one of you cleaver fellows discovered
539 what my actual mname is.  No matter.
540    I'm not sure my question was ever answered, so I'll ask again.  What is
541 Sulu's first name.  Orther Trek answers... Alpha Ceti 5 is wher the Botany
542 Bay was wrecked, and I also thought the ratio was 1 to 1.  Ahh, ignorance
543 is bliss.
544    Sorry for the stupid spelling mistakes... I'm in a hurry.

547 --------------------------------(<>)---------------------------------------
548 Theus: Try CBBS/NW (646-xxxx)
549 All: here's a simple puzzle, what is @#)-!)$!  Hint: you all know it well.
550 ----------------------(<>)The Traveller(<>)-------------------------------
551 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
552 Traveller:  The answer to your puzzle is quite simple.  @#)-!)$! is the phone
553 number for this system when you hold down the shift key while typing the number.
554 ??????????
555 Lord Morby:  I do know who you are, and have told only Milchar.  So you can't 
556 blame it on me!!!  Also, I don't know the Sulu answer, so please fill me in!!!
557 ??????????
558 Another Trek question!!!!!  Actually a few to keep you guys busy.
559 1.  What quadrant is the planet Gothos???
560 2.  What type of planet (A,B,M,Z,etc) is the planet Mudd???
561 3.  What was the most difficult desision of Kirk's life?(Not his career!!)
562 4.  What are Kirk's and Spock's serial numbers??
563 5.  What was Spock's pulse and blood pressure at the beginning of 'Naked Time'?
564 
565 I think these are enough, don't you???  Hawthorne, the class of ship in my last
566 question was the Dreadnought Class.  Think that you can now name them and thier
567 serial numbers???
568 
569 ????????????????????????????????????????????? The Doctor ???????????????????????
570 ------(<>)------
571 That was fast. I'll find
572 That was fast. Let's see if you can get tommorrows question.
573 GXIT
574 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
575 Gee whiz!  I'm gone for a few days and look what happens.
576 Let's see, where shall I begin?  How about randomly; that seems fairest.
577 -> 230-1041 on my keyboard does not translate to @#)-!)$!.  It looks
578 more like "# -! $!.  (There is no shift-zero.  On a non-disk system it
579 prints as a space, on a disk system it toggles the lower case on/off)
580 Ergo, your puzzle is invalid. (I'm the QUIZMASTER here, therefore I can be
581 arbitrary if I want to be.)
582 -> Leonard.  I've been working on your character groupings on and off,
583 I must admit to being stumped.
584 -> I see some new 'faces' since last I was on.  Lord Morby and DREAMTOUCHER.
585 Welcome!  You seem to be off to a better start than some we have had recently.
586 -> Sorry I missed PorSFiS.  It's nice to know I was missed.  Possibly I will
587 be able to make it next time. I'm curious to meet you all, especially Milchar,
588 since most of my correspondence seems to be with him.  No colorful robes or
589 bizarre people, eh?  Must all be in disguise.  Portland is a bit conservative,
590 after all.
591 -> HAWTHORNE.  Did you get any value out of my 'etiquette' message?  And how
592 is it I see you talking about 6809 after asking for Model III programs?
593 Model III is Z-80.
594 -> The adventure seems to be getting a bit rough. Croll got it in the
595 head, Voyeur got fried/minced, others are suffering bodily harm.Tsk tsk.
596 -> Star Trek.  Has Backwater become the haven for frustrated Trekkies?
597 What's with all the star trek questions lately?  Bear in mind that the answers
598 to most of the questions do not really exist, even the the 'universe' of
599 real Star Trek.  In my opinion, The Show is all that is really relevant.  The
600 books, concordances, compendiums, etc. etc. etc. are afterthoughts.  Written
601 by either fanciful trekkies (and therefore automatically disqualified as true
602 data) or written by someone out to make money on the phenomena.  Also not
603 'authentic'.  The only valid things known about the show are those things which
604 were seem/mentioned ON the show.  The ration of M/AM was never mentioned, does
605 not exist in real life (as a propulsion system) and is therefore only decided 
606 by whose book sells better.
607 All right, here I am. Tear me apart.
608 ??????????????????????????? QUIZMASTER ???????????????????????????????
609 IF NO ONE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING SO THIS DISK DRIVE WILL BE PURGED, THEN I 
610 WILL.
611 THIS IS THE BEST BBS IN THE WORLD.YOU SHOULD START UP A CHAIN OFTHEM.
