 24 March 17th, St. Patrick's Day
 25  
 26 St. Paddy's Day always reminds me of you.
 27 It was an important day for you. 
 28 It reminded you of your heritage. 
 29 You enjoyed the Irish in your blood.   
 30 I enjoyed being your friend.
 31 You were always easy to talk to.
 32 You were never judgmental.
 33 You never tryed to be impressive. 
 34 You were just yourself. 
 35 So much that was said.
 36 So much that didn't have to be said.
 37 So much that never was said.
 38 Your stories brought great enjoyment to me. 
 39 You allowed me into your life. 
 40 You let me see inside you in your stories.
 41 You let me see inside myself in our talks. 
 42 Much love passed between us.
 43 And much pain.
 44 I was honored to be counted as your friend. 
 45 I miss you Pam.

 61 Can't say I mind not being at the top. Nice to see others calling. Heres part
 62 17. Oh, I'm sorry if the quility has been off a bit the last couple of times.
 63 I've been really busy and unable to get much writting in. Thus I've had a bit
 64 less time to polish.
 65  
 66      Patrick searched for the parchment in his pack as William looked over his
 67 shoulder.
 68      "Wow! Thats really strange looking! You could carry a 2 man tent and a 
 69 couple sleeping bags in that thing and still have room to spare."
 70      "Thats not a bad idea. I wish I'd thought of it before we got trapped
 71 here."
 72      "Ah, here it is. Tucked into this book." 
 73      "Mind if I look at that?"
 74      "No, be carefull though."
 75      "No problem." 
 76      Patrick handed him the parchment and William examined it, rotating it
 77 and moving it closer and farther away from his face. Finally his eyes crossed.
 78 he shook his head and handed the parchment back to Patrick. "I think I'd better
 79 sit down." He said falling back onto his bed and staring at the ceiling.
 80      Laughing Patrick took the parchment and set it down on one of the desks.
 81 "It has about the same effect on me, Somtimes though I almost think I can 
 82 understand it."
 83      "Pat buddy, if you can understand that I'm impressed. Makes me dizzy just 
 84 thinking about that writting."
 85      "I wish I knew how Brian wrote it, as hard as it seems to be to read 
 86 I'll bet its worse to write."
 87      "Yeah, I suppose."
 88      Patrick sat in the chair in front of the desk and examined the rune. The
 89 wavering seemed to have a pattern. Almost without realizing it Patrick
 90 began to compensate for it. His head began to shake
 91 and his eyes  to move rythmicly all around the parchment.
 92      Somebody knocked on the door and his concentration was brocken. "Blast!
 93 Who the heck could that be? Could you check that out Will?"
 94      "Sure."
 95      The knock came again. William walked over to the door and opened it. 
 96 Outside stood a small man dressed much like the Inn keeper. "I'm the assistant
 97 Innkeeper, theres a package here for a William McAuley. Its supposed to go
 98 to this room." He said pointing to a medium sized wooden chest sitting in the
 99 hallway beside him.
100       "I'm William McAuley. I wonder were that came from?"
101       "It just appeared in the middle of the common room downstairs." The 
102 junior Innkeeper scratched his head. "Strange, but not unheard of. I should
103 have listened to my mother. She told me not to get into this business."
104       "Do I need to sign for it?"
105       "Hmm? Oh no. I figure that whoever sent it is plenty capable of makeing
106 sure it gets into the right hands. Besides, you look like the hounest type.
107 I'll help you drag it in if you'de like me to."
108       "Sure, thanks."
109       With little assistance from William the Junior Innkeeper pulled the
110 chest into the center of their room. "I must be getting back to the bar now.
111 Good day to the two of you."
112       "bye, thanks for the help."
113       "No problem." He said as the door closed behind him.
114       William stared at the chest for a moment before reaching out and
115 fiddling with the clasp that held it closed. There was a click as he managed 
116 to work it loose.
117       "Think we should open it?"
118       "Sure, if you don't mind though I'll use my staff just in case somthing 
119 is waiting to jump out at us."
120       William shrugged. "Fine with me." walking back and standing beside 
121 Patrick.
122       "Here we go." Patrick said reaching out with the staff and pushing up
123 on the lid. With a bit of effort it opened.

128         "Drat those Earthers!" swore Zariah.  It had not taken long to
129 discover the place that Mr. Noize and the Ruckus had spent the night.
130 But none of them were to be seen anywhere.
131         "Figures they'd go wandering off.  And I'll bet none of them has
132 any woodcraft to speak of.  That decadent world they hail from has
133 whipped any good sense they had out of them, I'll wager..."  Zariah's
134 gaze fell to the ground, where he saw footprints leading away.  His eyes
135 widened.
136         "And gone deeper into the forest!  I'd better find them, and
137 quickly- one look at a dryad and they're done for!  Not a living brain cell
138 between them, I'll bet," he mumbled as he followed the faint trail.
139 ###############
140         "Hey, anybody know how to tell which way is north?"
141         "Yeah," said Syd.  "I do.  I was a Boy Scout."
142         This provoked a long series of "You were not" and "Yeah, sure" and
143 "Tell us another one, bucko".
144         "I was too!  Ask Tony.  He's seen my old outfit."  The truth was
145 that Syd had stolen it as a boy and had kept it as a souvenir, but he was
146 not about to reveal this now.
147         "Yeah, he's got one.  Prob'ly stole it." drawled Tony.
148         Johnny was getting worried.  He *KNEW* Forest Park wasn't this big.
149 Where had they gone when under the influence of that "beer" of Tony's?
150         The forest grew darker, somehow gaining a sinister quality.  Tall
151 oaks, yews, and elms seemed to move slightly, creeping nearer and pressing
152 in towards them.  The birds grew quiet.
153         A loud giggle pierced the air.
154         Everyone turned to face a tremendous oak, gnarled with age.  A
155 beautiful woman lay upon the ground near it; she was small and slender,
156 clad only in a green garment that revealed much more than it hid.  This
157 seemed to produce a slight chin-dropping and mouth-opening effect among
158 the Ruckus.
159         She giggled again.  "Hello, my name is Bliss."  Her voice was
160 soft and pure, her manner seductive.
161         "Uh, hi."  That was all Johnny could manage.
162 ###############
163         The city was bustling with activity.  Hundreds of strangers
164 passed Merryl and I as we followed the directions written for us by
165 the coin dealer.
166         "That's it, Pan!"  Merryl pointed to a long slab of stone, placed
167 in the center of the block.  No one seemed to be paying attention to us.
168         "Sure looks like it.  All right, let's get started, then."
169         We took positions at opposite ends of the stone, and prepared
170 ourselves for the casting.  A few people looked over at us, but did nothing.
171         "Ready for number thirty?" I asked.
172         "Yes.  But Pan- don't ad-lib this time, okay?"
173         I smiled.  "Fair enough.  One!  Two!  Three!"
174         We began playing.  The Door spell required the most preparation-
175 it was not a minor thing to move yourself by magick.  I visualized the
176 School in Dunbarrah in complete detail- worn steps, spell-scarred ivy that
177 hung from the walls, narrow windows...  I knew Merryl was doing the same,
178 doubtless recalling other details.  The picture grew firm in my mind, gaining
179 solidity from the web of song we wove.  The stone slab glowed in response
180 as it felt our Power growing within the bounds we had set.
181         People were beginning to gather around us, watching.
182         I prayed they would not interrupt, and we continued.  My Power was
183 stretched out like a thin cord, ready to...

251 It appeared here from late 1985 to around march or 86. It was in 46 parts I 
252 believe. With a bit of editing it was very well writtn in my opinion.
253  
254 As you noted it was heckled very severly by somebody who seemed to have some
255 sort of vendeta. 
256  
257 It was believed at the time that the DESTROYER was a pen name for JD.
258 Silverman, and from what I read I beleive this might have been true.

266 Ok, heres part 18. 
267  
268      William walked up and looked inside. Opening it up had not reveled 
269 anything immediatly dangerous.
270      Other then his name and their room letter there had been nothing on the
271 outside to indicate who might have sent it. Inside it was just as berift of 
272 information.
273      What it did contain were clothes, sleeping bags, a tent and other camping
274 suplies.
275      "Somebody seems to like us." Noted William.
276      "It would appear so. I'd bet that stuff would cost a bit of money back
277 home. Looks to be from there to. Did you check the labels?"
278      "Yeah, all earth made. First rate stuff to. Light and compact. Shouldn't
279 have any trouble carying it around. No backpacks though, thats strange."
280      "No, not if whomever sent this stuff knew about my pack. It should just
281 be able to hold everything."
282      "Hmm, we don't need any of this stuff right now. Might as well see I 
283 guess."
284      As Patrick had surmised they were able to place the tent,sleeping bags and
285 everything else in the pack. It was a close fit though. William lifted it
286 up off of his bed after everything had been placed inside and the zipper
287 had been done up. "Light as a feather! Amazing."
288      "Yeah, I'd bet that if we could find lead weights to fill that pack we'd b
289 able to float up into the sky while holding on to the straps."
290      "Thats good and bad. If we ever have to carry anything really heavy we're
291 going to have to be carfull or everything will be flying the friendly skies
292 so to speak." William noted.
293      "True. Hmm, Looks like it's about three by my watch. What time did your 
294 mom expect you to be back?"
295       "Oh she probably won't start to worry till late tonight. I didn't really
296 give her an exact time."
297      "Me either. I really don't want to have them worry about us. Hopefully
298 we'll get back before it gets to late."
299      "Hate to be pessimistic, But getting those camping supplies makes me 
300 sort of think that we're not going home anytime soon Pat."
301      "Maybe, Every time I try to figure out that rune somthing seems to 
302 happen." He paused for a moment. "Hmm, Now that I think about it I was holding 
303 the orb when I read the rune that returned me home. Maybe It will help me 
304 understand this one."
305      "Worth a try. Why don't you give me one of those books you brought
306 along, I'll read while you study."
307      "Sure, you have your choice of f through k of the Encylopedia."
308      "Hmm, some exciting letters there. I guess I'll just take a nap."
309      "I hope I can figure this out soon, I'm getting a bit tired
310 of just sitting around here helplesly."
311      "Yeah, But it could be a whole lot worse. We could be stuck in some 
312 soggy jungle in the middle of nowere without food or shelter."
313      "Ok, I guess you have a point. Well third times a charm." 
314      Patrick dug the orb out of the pack and returned to the desk
315 were the parchment still sat. "Ok, Here goes nothing." He thought. With the
316 orb in one hand he looked down at the paper. It was as clear as day. 
317      Without reading the rune he put the Orb down. The wavering returned 
318 instantly. As he moved the Orb farther and farther away the wavering continued
319 to increase. Returning it to his hand he looked down at the crystal clear
320 symbol. His Uncle had told him it was a focus...
321      "Well, I've figured it out."
322      "Great, what does it mean?
323      "I'm don't know. I'm not able to tell that yet."
324      "Its not the same as the one that got you home though is it?"
325      "No, I'm sure of that. Want to take a chance?"
326      "Sure, I don't think that Brian guy would give you anything that would 
327 get us killed."
328      "Didn't seem the type. Ok, are you ready?" 
329      "As ready as I'll ever be."
330      Patrick looked down and read the rune.

369 those who long for power fear lack of control. they must be in control of
370 everything all of the time because they know best. what they do no realize
371 is that it is easier and far more fulfilling to give up to that void they
372 try to fill with power. take it slow, take it easy. live for now, this
373 moment before it is gone, never to come again. learn from the past but
374 do not dwell there overlong; concern youself with the future but do not
375 worry about what you cannot control or change.
376  
377 fame: i don't get this one. i don't wish to become famous. i wish to share
378 my world view(s) with others and learn from theirs. i like to think perhaps
379 that in sharing my uniqueness (we are all unique) i share a little of myself
380 and the world around me that perhaps wasn't all that visible to others.
381 likwise, i like to see what others find out about the world around them.

387  
388                       Another fine product
389                         from Day Research
390  
391  
392 Are you tried of being told that you can't make a COM file out of 
393 an EXE file? Well, Day Research has come to your rescue!
394  
395 Now  you too can enjoy the pleasure of having your very  own  COM 
396 file  that you make yourself in your very own home on  your  very 
397 own  computer!  Through  the miracle of  modern  programming  Day 
398 Research brings you...MAKECOM! (ta da!)
399  
400 As the thankless result of an obviously bored and slightly crazed 
401 programmer  who  struggled for the better part of an  evening  to 
402 perfect the incredible techniques used in MAKECOM we are able  to 
403 provide  this  product to you at the unbelievably  low  price  of 
404 FREE!  That's right, this program will cost you nothing!  (Except 
405 maybe your sanity.)
406  
407 MAKECOM  will convert any EXE file to a COM file with just a  few 
408 simple commands on  your  computer's  keyboard.  And  it  REALLY, 
409 REALLY WORKS! It slices! It Dices! Opps! Wrong commercial... 
410  
411 But Wait! That's not all! Act now and we will throw in absolutely 
412 free  the Pascal source code MAKECOM.PAS. Learn how you can  make 
413 your  own Pascal programs right in your own bathroom!  (Which  is 
414 where this belongs.) 
415  
416 As an added incentive (and because we have several thousand extra 
417 bytes  we can't figure out how else to get rid of), we will  also 
418 include at absolutely no cost to you (or ourselves) the Assembler 
419 source  MAKECOM.ASM.  Now  you too can learn how  to  write  real 
420 assembly code using the Seattle Computer Products Assembler! 
421  
422 How  much  would  you expect to pay for all  this?   Ten  Million 
423 dollars? Twenty million dollars? (Would you believe...fifty cents 
424 and  a baseball card?) Well forget what you might expect  to  pay 
425 (because  you probably have a better idea of it's value  than  we 
426 do).  The MAKECOM program, and the source files  MAKECOM.PAS  and 
427 MAKECOM.ASM are all yours for the unbelievably low price of FREE!
428  
429 And if you are among the first 10 million callers We'll throw  in 
430 at  no added cost (except maybe shipping, handling and  a  rather 
431 large  gratuity charge) MAKEHEX.PAS an Intel hex format to  Turbo 
432 Pascal hex format conversion program. Now you can convert the HEX 
433 file produced by your Seattle Computer Products Assembler into  a 
434 HEX format that is compatible to Turbo Pascal! What more could  a 
435 programmer want!
436  
437 Order  your copy of MAKECOM, the Pascal source  MAKECOM.PAS,  the 
438 Assembler  Source  MAKECOM.ASM,   and  the  incredible  companion 
439 program  MAKEHEX.PAS   today  by calling our  easy  to  use  toll 
440 number!  1-900-555-MAKE.  That's 1-900-555-DUMB. (Wait a  minute, 
441 I  thought it was 1-900-555-FOOD? No, no, you're thinking of  the 
442 food processor commercial..it's 1-900-555-BURP! Opps! Excuse me.)   
443  
444 Sorry, no COD orders, no credit card orders, no cash orders,  and 
445 no  phone orders allowed. In fact, no orders at all are  allowed! 
446 (We're a rather independent lot.)
447  
448 What better Gift for that PC programmer you know on April 1st!
449  
450 But hurry, this offer is only good while supplies last. 
451  
452 MakeCom  may  not work with all EXE files. The EXE file  must  be 
453 smaller  than 64K to be converted. Only works on true EXE  files, 
454 not  on  EXE files destined to become a true COM file  or  a  BIN 
455 file.   Offer  void  where  prohibited  by  law  (and  should  be 
456 prohibited everyplace else).
457  
458  
459 Don't  forget, Get MAKECOM today! Do it now! Right this  instant! 
460 *Run* to that phone!...NOW!!! (pant pant pant...)
461

488 didn't you. Well, that's ok. Cool you're back. A commodore 64, huh? well,
489 rename yourself!!! the commodore 64 champ! I don't believe that AD or myself

491 realized that this is mainly for stories and not for idle conversation which
492 I cannot contribute (not a good enough writer :)) If you notice very few
493 messages have been from me. AD's messages are mostly his story which is
494 very very good and in many parts. I log in and read his and the stories of
495 other Backwater members. They are very good stories. AD's story is EXCELLENT
496 right now and is getting better. You should try and get the other disks
497 from Mikey in order to read it. It's INCREDIBLE! I still enjoy this board
498 very much because I like to read the works of others who post here, but I
499 just don't call as often (well I call but just read only and don't enter).
500 I can remember when I first logged on too! You were the first to talk to
501 me. Everyone else practically ignored me... that was rude for me. But you
502 were cool and talked to me. Nowadays I talk to almost everyone who calls
503 this system, especially AD, who is a really cool/nice person and a great

518 Thanks for the praise VISION, the checks in the mail :-).
519  
520 It took me an hour to get on here, and then I find that nothing has been 
521 entered since noon. Very strange. Well, its 8pm march 21 right now. Here's
522 part 19.
523  
524      His suroundings spun around him. He could feel himself rising out of the
525 room and leaving all the things that were there behind. Realising that He
526 would lose his possesions as well as his friend William and Cymry he 'reached'
527 out and grabed them. 
528      For a moment the effort caused him to become dazed. When his senses 
529 returned he realized that William and Cymry now floated to either side of him 
530 along with the small cache of possesions they had managed managed to gather.
531 They were no longer in the Inn. It now appeared that they were floating 
532 in deep space. Occasionaly dots of light could be seen in the distance, But 
533 soon they would fade and dissapere only to be replaced by others.
534      Patrick tried to speak but no sound came from his mouth. To his right
535 William moved his mouth as if trying to tell him somthing. Patrick realized 
536 that he was gesturing of into the blackness in front of them.
537      Looking forward again He could see another light approaching. Unlike 
538 the others this one grew brighter. A cold wind pulled at them and looking 
539 around Patrick saw a body fly by. It was hard to tell what it had been, but
540 whatever it was now it was not alive. Patrick felt the bile rise in his 
541 throat but was unable to relieve his nausea. Beside him William bent over
542 in chocked convulsions as well.
543      The Light had gotten so close now that it nearly blinded them. With a
544 load bang sound returned and they found themselves in a small room that looked
545 to be a study. Both Patrick and William were finally able to empty their 
546 stomachs. Cymry looked on in sympathy.
547      "Have a bad trip?" Asked Brian who was seated behind the large desk that
548 filled most of one end of the room.
549      William was the first to recover. "Who the hell are you?"
550      "You must be a friend of Patricks. I am Brian of Brians school of magic,
551 Perhaps he has mentioned me?"
552      "Yeah, your the one who gave him that parchment. Were the heck were we?
553 And what killed that... whatever it was."
554      "You saw somthing while in the ether? A one in a million chance at
555 best." He glanced at the mess on the floor "Must have been unpleasent judging 
556 by the way you two arrived."
557      Patrick managed to catch his breath. "It was..." He said before chocking
558 again.
559     "Never mind, don't think about it if it makes you ill. I would however 
560 like to know how you managed to bring along two other beings plus possesions
561 with a spell that was designed to carry one."
562     Patrick pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his mouth. For the
563 first time he was glad his grandmother had insisted on placing one in his
564 pockets whenever she did the washing. "I just 'picked' them up. It was a
565 bit of a strain though."
566     "Really? You amaze me again. I trust you have come to learn somthing of
567 magic. You have certainly shown an aptitude for it."
568     "Well, I'd like to learn magic, but right now William and I need to get
569 home."
570     "Home? Isn't that were you came from?"
571     Patrick related to him what had transpired.
572     "I see, So you didn't come here from your home... I'm afraid I have some
573 rather bad news."
574     "What?"
575     "Right now there is no way for me to get any of you there. The spell you
576 used would have returned you there if you had used it again, but since
577 you used it from this Inn you told me off it will now only return you there."
578     "Isn't there some other way?" William asked.
579     "Not that I know of. I have no idea were in the multi-verse the two of
580 you come from. Untill one of you learns or remembers the proper spell..."
581     "Then we can get back?"
582     "You did it once didn't you?"
583     "Yes, But I can't remember that rune anymore."
584     "It will return to you eventually. Untill that time you can stay here and
585 learn of magic."

641 .
642  
643 	I am proposing a new shared world to set stories in here on Backwater.
644 The world will be known as Etherworld and will be much like the worlds
645 depicted in variose Cyberpunk novels.
646  
647 	Etherworld exists in the mid 21st century. Mankind has developed
648 computers that are so powerfull they are able to support synthetic realities
649 that people can 'exist' in if they have interface plugs. Interface plugs are
650 placed either under the ear or at the base of the skull.
651  
652 	Genetics and mechanical enhancment has been developed to an extremly
653 high level. The technology has become so cheap that almost anybody can be 
654 enhanced beyond even todays greatest athletes. 
655  
656 	The world is controled by several large Corporations that control the
657 means of production and just about everything else as well. Governments have
658 become nearly non-existant. Needless to say it is a very violent place.
659  
660 	If the Corporations control the means of production then the net 
661 jockeys control the glue that keeps things going. Whithout the world wide
662 computer networks Everything would soon come to a halt. The corporations 
663 would be unmanagable and mass starvation would be nearly immediate.
664  
665 	Each Corporation has it's own private army known as CP's, or 
666 Corporate Police. These private armies keep order in and around the special
667 company towns that exist in varios parts of the world. Outside these little
668 enclaves life is violent and hard.
669  
670 	Many people either are not allowed to or refuse the work for the
671 mega-corporations. Some have formed terrorist organizations bent upon
672 'Tearing down the dispicable machines of destruction that rob mankind of
673 it's freedom and human Dignaty.'
674  
675 	Amoung the most effective of these groups are the Net Jockies. They
676 are the biggest threat to the Corporations and are ruthlessly hunted down
677 whenever possible. 
678  
679 	The Corporations employ their own Jockies known as 'arnolds' in
680 net jocky circles. For the most part these arnolds are no match for the
681 average Net Jockey. The Corporations fear what might happen if a truelly 
682 quilified arnold were to turn. Never the less there are still some 
683 arnolds that have managed to 'burn' a jockey.
684 	
685 	Thats all for now, we can fill in details later. We need to flesh
686 out atleast one Corporation and make up a villain. Almost anything could
687 happen in this world. 
688  
689 	Movies/books that fit into the genra(sp?) are Bladerunner, RoboCop,

746 The following is a rather short entry that ties up the first part of Patricks
747 tale. I'll be working on part II, but it might be awhile before you see0entries
748 from it.
749  
750      "But what about William?"
751      "Well, he can enroll here as well. He might have some talent. If he 
752 doesn't there are many other schools in this district. One of them must
753 teach somthing he is interestud in."
754      "What about money? All of this can't be free."
755      "Don't worry about that. I'll take care of everything. I think you have 
756 outstanding potential. A Scholership has been offered you. I will also 
757 Finance Williams education,0as yt is somewhat my fault that he is here."
758      "I don't think we have much choice Pat." William noted.
759      "I suppose you're right, and it wouldn't have to be forever."
760      William looked around and smiled. "Yeah, and meanwhile it's thu adventure 
761 of a lifetime."

782      We need to develop a methodology to help }ake0decisions that reflect the
783      ethic of sustainability.  We must imagine what the presence of 5 billion
784      people doing what we want would mean.  "Think globally, act locally".
785      Imagine 5 billion paper plates, 5 billion styrofoa} cupc, 5 billion
786      discarded televisions.  As we make our purchases, we need to analyze:
787  
788           1)  Do we really need it?
789  
790           2)  Is it the most durable and reusable available?
791  
792           3)  Is it the smallect, simplest, and most energy efficient?
793  
794           4)  Is it biodegradable?
795  
796           5)  Does it promote social and environmental harmony?
