46 	and one of the items is something called "Copylink Communications," from
47 	an outfit called U.S. Digital, for the exorbitant price of $29.99.

63 I now have a computer with which to communicate, but no uploading software
64 with which to send text.  So -- a technical question:
65   Should I send a character and wait for BW to echo it or simply put in a
66 delay?  Should I delay at the end of each line, or is BW ready to accept
67 the next line when it echoes the carriage return?

242 Piper: wait for echo is both necessary & sufficient. BW will accept the
243 next char after the <cr> but not echo it until it is ready for the one
244 after that. It is possible to 'dump' the entire line, plus one char. 
245 When that char is echoed, you could 'dump' the rest of that line (plus
246 one char). etc.

249 greetings,
250       It's getting cooler outside and the ski season hasn't started
251 yet, so I'm kinda stuck here at the terminal for entertainment. I and
252 about 12,000 other students started school monday at PSU.  It was a
253 mad house to be sure, I managed to get a parking permit and tuition
254 paid for the privialge of attending classes.  Writing 121 and a intro
255 to college math.  For a old girl like me to be taking FRESHMEN classes
256 has a numbing effect on the brain.  Other than that things are pretty
257 normal.   Does anyone remember my old chariters of Leo and Ontho and
258 Alex the young duke?  If not, Ill let them float around for a while and
259 start something new.   Intellegent input welcomed.

297 Voyeur: Let's see, probably those old CL packages came from PC America.
298 The last time I checked they had about 100 or so units that they still
299 had in stock and were trying to unload. Since they bought them at $45
300 each, and probably dumped them for $10 each to get ride of them, that
301 means they made around -$35 on each package. Yup, thar's gold in them
302 there software packages! Quick, buy them all up before they disappear!

406      Hello out there, oh you people of little perception.  If for no other 
407 reason than the writing styles are different, you should realize that I am 
408 not the, or an ultimate intelligence.  I am not so stupid as to declare 
409 myself fit to answer any question that comes my way, and not so stupid as to
410 do it on a board that actually houses intelligent people (for the most part,
411 anyway...).
412      Let's see, haven't been around in awhile.  Interesting, but all talk and 
413 no stories makes one very (ick) board.  Mr. E?  Wolftags???  Ah well, I did not
414 think that would surface here, but it sure did.  I don't think Grey Wolf calls
415 this system much anyway.
416      Well, as I have things to do, I will terminate.  Hi to Lady S. and Darbon
417 and Adric and....

439         Dear Ultimate Intelligence,
440              What type of superior being are you? If you are really all that
441 superior being, you probably won't know the answer to this question, so 
442 everyone else may consider this a question for them too. 
443              Why is it that in every class I have taken at PCC there has been
444 one intelligent (self-centered), obnoxious man who considers it his personal 
445 duty to contradict every statement that the teacher and books make?
446     
447                                                              Lady S.

449  
450         De Dear Innmates,
451               Since it is cold and flu season, please take 5 000 milligrams
452 of vitamin C a day; but be careful not to take more than 10 000 mg. a day
453 because people have died of vitamin C overdose. Please forgive my premature
454 naternalness, but I'm not into influenza epidemics. 
455  
456                                                              Lady S.

460  
461 And by the way, Triple Five; I personally find you're telecommunications 
462 behavior completely pre-adolescent.
463  
464                                                              Lady S.

470    Picky, picky.  Only one mistake in the spelling, and you have to append the 
471 thing.  Last time I type for you (well, maybe not).  On to the serious flame...
472    Triple five, you disgust the very fibre of my being.  Your flagrant misuse
473 of backwater is more than "Pre-adolescent".  By far worse than a criminal 
474 waste.  You are one of the reasons why this should be a password system, so 
475 that you could be deleted.  I don't know why you get off on sending blank lines
476 but if you must, go to the Parrot and send them in private mail and you can 
477 enjoy them twice as much...

482 Dear Keeper of Souls: What happens when
483 an "irristable" force runs into a immovable object is most interesting. Both
484 under go a change and are shifted into
485 another reality. As for the answer to
486 Lady s's question, it is another of the
487 laws of the Universe and is not liable
488 to be changed any time soon, because
489 you run into these people through out
490 this life and this pheononem prepares
491 you for them....

514 IS GOING ON OVER THESE PHONE LINES.  IT SEEMS I'VE FOUND SOME ENTERTAINMENT
515 RIGHT HERE ON THIS BOARD!  THERE IS A REPEATED REFERENCE MADE TO A "BLUE
516 PARROT."  IS THIS ANOTHER BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM?  IF IT IS, COULD SOMEONE FILL
517 ME IN ON IT?  THANKS!

519 Apologies in advance, but you gotta try it sometime--

531 To KHW:     How ya doin' mate?It's been  few time-space units since we 
532 met on this system.I've been out of comission for a while thanx to one
533 obnoxious guy called Cirith Ungol.I DO NOT like this one, he's real depresin
534 and nasty.Anyway, how has life been on bwms whilst I've been absent?Any
535 good stories or anything like that??? Any by the author of the story of
536 the dancer...???
537    Anyway, I'll be entering a new bit to the Elforson saga,(Even though
538 it's not much good..)If you like it lemme know, if not, again, lemme know
539 somehow.(This is aimed at KHW specifically., as I can trust his/her 
540 opinion.

542                           I'm now only two hundred levels below the
543 surface now, and I'm worried because I've heard a few guard 'bots
544 around this level.I'm on an ancient battered mkIII at the moment.What 
545 worries me is how ancient it is.This era on this world shouldn't be this
546 advanced.It's apparently a couple of hundred years old.This isn't Camtim
547 stuff, I suspect that one being i responsible.....
548 
549              Oh s**t, I'm in trouble, there's a damned great 'bot headed
550 this way, and it's not an engineering job either....

558 KathyD: Welcome to PSU and red tape and long lines...
559 Piper: If you would like to use it, I've got a 'quicky' uploader made just
560   for BW.  I wrote it before I had anything else, just to tide me over.  The
561   hitch is that it's in mbasic.  If I remember correctly, it has a timed loop
562   in it to wait for BW's <cr>, but that could easily be changed to a
563   'wait for echo', or adjusted for you cpu (mine's 4.7Mhz).  I'll send it
564   thru L'homme if you would like, or put it on the upload section of cbbs/nw
565   Let me know if you're desperate enough for it...

568 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
569 Emu -- Thanks, but I don't think it would do much good.  My new box doesn't
570 speak basic -- I've gotta hack in 'C' or Smalltalk.  While it would be
571 easier in Smalltalk, I like Emacs for an editor and St takes forever to
572 load (after all my image is nearly 2MB).  I just have to come to terms
573 with the 'C' calls -- it's been a long, long time.
