35   Standing a little apart from the others, the piper watched the efforts being
36 made to decrypt the arcane code playing over the face of the machine.  He 
37 looked again -- nope, just as unintelligible as ever.  All the talk of 
38 polyalphabetic substitution, letter frequency, one-time pads, and trap-door
39 encryption made him shudder each time it passed by.
40   Looking around, he decided that someone should be on the lookout.  The diamond
41 valley was eye-searingly bright, but the day could not last forever.  Circling
42 the machine, he could see no trace of a power supply, the hard gravel of the
43 valley floor ruled out an excavation, and the machine's case seemed to be 
44 without seams.  Walking around the machine, he made his way further into the
45 valley proper.  Looking for a vantage point, he climbed a slight rise, and 
46 looked back up the little canyon that contained the gateway, the machine, and
47 the rest of the party.
48 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
49   Who says we can't be in two places at once?
50 Back at the inn--
51   The piper rose from his table in a dark corner of the room where he had been
52 lurking nursing one of the Inn's famous nut-brown ales.  Wiping the last trace
53 of foam from his moustache, he shouldered his pipes and called out to the 
54 innkeeper and the rest of the patrons,
55   "We have some familiar faces here today.  Pam is back with tales of her 
56 travels, and isn't that someone familiar that just came in?  d -- or would 
57 you rather be called Dragon Lady?  I remember you from my lurking days.  Welcome
58 back.  You've been sorely missed.  The reality of the inn has sometimes slipped,
59 but we've tried to keeep it alive."
60   With that, the piper stepped forward into a cleared area of the floor, swung
61 his pipes to his shoulder, placed the blowpipe in his mouth and inflated the
62 bag with one mighty breath.  A short push in the side started the drones, and
63 he dropped his right hand to join his left on the shaft of the chanter.  The
64 sonourous hum of the drones filled the inn, followed by the dancing notes of
65 the chanter as he played, for Pam, "The Rowan Tree," for -d-, "The Piper's
66 Delight," and for all ladies present (you too, Kathy)  "The Australian Ladies."

69 	L'homme and Bard, who had both solved the code, and now knew the
70 'magic' word, stood separate from the others, still milling about, devoid
71 of definite purpose, looking for leadership, with the absence of Milchar.
72 	"What now?", queried L'homme. "What do we do with the word so
73 conveniently left for us? What happends next?"
74 	The Bard just shrugged. L'homme thought of despair and wasted effort.
75 His lamenting was interrupted by a sigh. A sigh from Bard.
76 	"What now?", asked L'homme again.
77 	"It's all so obvious.", replied Bard. And with that Bard reached into
78 his ever-present bag, rummaged around for something contained therein, and
79 hummed a little ditty under his breath.
80 	"This is very confusing.", L'homme told him, "But I'm willing to play
81 your little waiting game a bit longer. You have an idea don't you?"
82 	Bard didn't look up, but he shook his head up and down, the customary
83 affirmative response.
84 	"Wait and see. Wait and see.", thought L'homme.

87 Milch : Don't concern yourself with the fill. I'll give you the low-down next
88  next time we talk. I ran some debug on POINT(x,y), and it seemed to be working.
89 When I say seem, I mean the value returned in `return' was always zero, which
90 was correct. It never got to a non-background color, which would return some-
91 thing other than zero, before the stack ran out. Like I said before, when
92 the C64 had a stack overflow, there were no warning messages, no columns of
93 smoke pouring forth from the air vents, nothing spectacular at all. It 
94 simply went back to BASIC. It took quite a bit of work to discover it was the
95 stack overflow and not some other `feature' of the C I was working with. C64
96 strikes again! Yes...PorSFiS is today, but I can't make it out in time to
97 give you a ride. Maybe we can shoot for two weeks from now. Can Tom stand it?
98 Alex : Next time we play Risk, I will bring the books along. So you too have
99 discovered another of the many bugs in Applesoft. At RHC, we had to deal
100 with such things too. We finally just coded around the bugs, rather than
101 spend(waste) time trying to figure some clever way to avoid the problem.
102 Buckaroo Banzai report. We were only laughed aat 2 or 3 times. We did see

116 I finished stowing my things and kindly asked Novar which way the Keystone
117 was.  "Right outside.", he replied.  I thanked him, and hurried off in
118 search of my friends.  Novar didn't seem to care about what had happened to
119 them, for he remained behind.
120 He was right.  A door exactly the same as the other I had passed through
121 only two days ago stood open.  I entered quickly, thinking of the little 
122 time we had left to return the necklace to Mariani.  The room was the same,
123 but the voice failed to make itself heard.  I strode quickly to the Diamond
124 Valley door and threw it open.  What I saw amazed me.  Myriads of facets of
125 the crystal forms inside reflected the light in a thousand beams of 
126 brilliant silver, creating the largest display of the laws of refraction
127 and reflection I had ever seen.  Squinting a bit due to the brightness, I
128 passed through the door.  A trail of sorts lead onward into the tangle of
129 forms.  Throwing caution to the winds, I ran down the path in hopes of 
130 finding the others that much sooner.  A few close calls involving the very
131 pointy tips of the crystal persuaded me to slow the pace.  Time to use my
132 newly-returned magic, I thought.  Pulling the Wand from my robes, I again
133 chanted the runes imprinted on one of my many 3 X 5 cards...  The end of
134 the wand seemed to catch fire as I spoke, and I began to trace out the 
135 bounds of a gateway.  Faster and faster I sketched, making the gate widen
136 and solidify, spinning in accordance with my wand... Suddenly, I stopped
137 and lept through the gate an instant before the natural laws of the universe
138 closed it behind me again, sealing off the wound I had created in space.
139 I looked about me, and yes, I did seem to be closer... hmmm, over that hill 
140 there I believe I hear voices... and is that Piper on top of it?  A little
141 off, I said to myself, perhaps I need practice to get back into the swing
142 of things.  I wondered what had happened to everyone during my "illness" as
143 I began to climb the hill toward Piper.
144 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
145 Anyone with 6522 docs, and that includes you Mig; in a 1541 disk drive, 
146 which of the 6522 lines are connected to anything of importance?  The
147 read/write head, the light on the drive, the door sense, write protect 
148 notch sense, anything?
149 Yes, I do know there are two 6522's in the drive, but I now know what the
150 computer is getting from the drive, so I know what some of those lines do...
151 Also, which one of the registers is the timer?  Is it set in a similiar
152 manner as the 6526?  
153 L'homme; I see what you meant on the phone.  I'll try to get the program
154 from Rick (my friend I told you about) and see how it works.  As for the
155 PorSFiS meeting in two weeks, I will go, Tom or no Tom.  What can he do,
156 fire me?  I'm quaking in my boots.  All I want to do for him is to finish
157 one more program, and have done with him.  Hmm, my weekends again free from
158 him... ahh, the possibility of actually being able to DO something on 
159 weekends....

173      "...and it's certainly interesting to note that some people can just
174 believe what they are told and fall in step, while others find themselves
175 obliged to question and inquire into the nature of things. In any case the
176 latter type seems to be part of a vanishing breed. As a friend of mine once
177 answered, when someone quipped 'it takes all kinds to make a world', "If
178 that's the case then where are all these different kinds?" He was noted for
179 twisting the obvious around until it seemed unique. A talent that...
180      As Mez rambled on the other folks at the table noticed that he had
181 raised his head slightly and seemed to be sniffing at the air. Clearly some
182 thing besides the group at the table had captured his attention.
183      "Did any of the rest of you notice that scent? It's certainly enticing,
184 peaches perhaps, no apricots. Now where have I encountered it before?" While
185 Mez spoke a smile began to form on his lips and spread until his entire face
186 reflected an aura of great humor. "Yes, yes it was when I was back in Junior
187 Wizard school. She was the one who could communicate with those creatures of
188 myth and magic. Now she was certainly one to remember, aah such pleasant...
189 is it possible?"
190      Looking around the room it was obvious that the crowd at the Inn had
191 increased considerably. At first he didn't see anyone who might fit the
192 description that was qo clear in his mind. Just as he was turning back to
193 the warmth of the hearth his eyes stopped suddenly. Her head was turned away
194 and in the dim light he couldn't be absolutely sure, but who else could it be
195 in such an elegant costume? Mez knew that calling out would be a mistake, she
196 was not a person one approached abruptly. He reached out with his mind, ever
197 so gently, whispered #creatures who know flight always remember to look up# .

261      While waiting for the boarding call I've been having an extremely
262 enjoyable, and occasionally animated, conversation with a retired history
263 professor who was on my previous flight and was also stranded.  Politics,
264 literature, morality, and even (urp!) television have been the meat of our
265 verbal meal.  Though we mostly disagree, I find his arguments delightful
266 since he debates to find a conclusion and reach a consensus rather than to
267 support a position in which he has an emotional stake.  Like myself, he
268 desires to shed light instead of heat, so more often than not we find
269 ourselves meeting in the center after starting at opposting poles.  And,
270 since his fund of available facts is so much greater than my own, each
271 subject leaves me feeling informed and invigorated.
272  
273      The initial call for seating assignments comes, and we approach the
274 podium together, but the subject of our dialogue has become too dear to us
275 to leave it behind as so often happens to strangers indulging in casual
276 conversation.  When we finally reach the front of the line, he places his
277 ticket on the counter at the same time I do, and to my surprise the
278 representative of the airlines picks up both tickes and asks, "You're
279 flying together?"
280  
281      Before I can speak, my companion responds, "That's correct."
282  
283      Glancing at our tickets, the man behind the counter looks a bit
284 perplexed.  "I'm ....  I'm sorry, but if you're together, why are you
285 flying first class and she's flying coach?"
286  
287      "Um, uh, ur..." I add, ever the height of witty repartee under pressure.
288  
289      Suddenly my elderly friend has adopted a tired, wounded, and stricken
290 air.  "Well, your airline has managed to ruin nearly everything else in our
291 trip so far, so I'm really not surprised at this final indignity."  His
292 mood of weary strength in the face of the massed forces of wicked
293 ineptitude is almost palpable.  I'm both stunned and impressed.
294  
295      "But..." I start to object, only to receive a quick jab in the ribs
296 from his elbow.
297  
298      "Now, now dear, don't worry," he croons soothingly, "we'll still get
299 there.  I'll see you in Seattle."  He reaches for my ticket.  "I'll take
300 the coach seat, you take the comfortable one."
301  
302      "No, no please!"  The man behind the counter looks stricken.  "We're
303 terribly sorry about all the problems that have occurred with your flight.
304 Here, " he takes my ticket, "I'll reassign you to first class."
305  
306      "Thank you, sir!  Your work to solve our dilemma is greatly
307 appreciated.  Believe me, your courtesy will be mentioned to your
308 superiors."
309  
310      After we leave the counter I whisper "Don't you think that was just a
311 little dishonest?"
312  
313      His wrinkled face turns toward me and he smiles.  "Don't you think
314 you're a little young to be acting so old?"

318      I pause in my tale as I notice the change in the mood of the room, a
319 subtle lightening that reminds me of other, less complicated times.  Or
320 perhaps they only seem less complicated when viewed through the blinders of
321 imperfect memory.  Quickly, I begin to look about as if searching for an
322 object too dear to name, too costly to price.  But though these well lit
323 areas show no sign, I know that it is in the less frequented tables that
324 she is most likely to be found.  I wonder if she brought Daon?

330   The piper shifted uncomfortably on his self-chosen lookout position.  His 
331 eyes had painfully adapted to the glare, but he feared the length of time it
332 would take to re-adapt to a darker clime.  Scanning the surrounding territory
333 in sectors, he had just taken in enough of the view to become sensitized to 
334 anything different within his field of view.  He was just able to discern the
335 location of the doorway that had led them to this spot, and gave it more than
336 it's due share of attention.  Some of the party -- it looked like L'Homme and 
337 Bard -- were gathered off to one side of the machine, whilee the others were
338 still working on the puzzle.  A motion near the doorway caught his attention--
339                 a flicker of motion, as though a figure were running--                                                   
340 The piper scanned the surrounding area, still no changes.  The running figure
341 had stopped now and was performing some intricate actions, but the piper felt
342 no sense of menace.  Suddenly, the figure leaped forward and disappeared!
343   The piper loosed his dirk in its sheath, hoping that he had not allowed a
344 danger to creep up on the party and redoubled his vigilance.  A motion much 
345 nearer, at the base of the hill he had chosen for lookout, caught his attention
346 as a figure made a diving roll out of thin air.  There was something familiar 
347 about -- the step, the way it moved it's body -- a brief flash of the face and
348 yes-- it was Milchar.  He seemed to be moving well, climbing as though he had
349 suffered no ill effects from his bout of unconciousness.  The piper waved in 
350 welcome, not relaxing his vigilance.  When Milchar reached the summit of the 
351 hill, the piper welcomed him.
352    "Welcome.  You look none the worse for your little nap."  Gesturing towards
353 the party, the piper said, "It looks like a few people have made progress on
354 the puzzle.  I don't have much patience with puzzles, so thought I'd better 
355 keep a watch.  I don't like the feel of this place -- something seems to be
356 just on the edge of happening."

360 The Inn had grown quieter, Pam had stopped telling of her adventure, and 
361 was looking around. Finally, she stopped and was looking towards the 
362 hearth. The Innkeeper followed her gaze and saw a lovly figure dressed in 
363 white warming herself in front of the dying fire. "My goodness! All of my

384          who had been somehow brainwashed into carrying somekind of
385          earthshaking device.  I made a rash choice and used the trident
386          to stop the vehicle the child was operating. Cooked em good..
387          Sigh, I guess it couldn't have been avoided, I so underestimate
388          the power I carry.  I know the others think I'm gruesome and
389          the elders will wag their fingers..
390 
391      Leo closed the journal, not feeling any better.  Ontho announced
392 arrival at headquarters in about 1100 micro's.  Leo hoped that Alex would
393 be there to see how the day went.
394      Ontho slowed the craft to land. No welcomming party at all. This
395 whole day should never have happened.  Ontho buzzed "nazz rtztz dezz"
396 jumped up and down and waved tenicles.  (translated:  I'm taking this
397 over to the lab you better check in and get something to eat)
398      how did that little twit know I was hungry? Leo thought to herself.
399 Strange creatures Inmo's, I think the elders have been training Ontho
400 in mind reading, inwhich case I had better change my atitude now.. Or
401 I'll have an ememy instead of a partner. Leo jumped down off the disk
402 and helped Ontho down. Ontho waddled off towards the Lab and Leo went
403 inside the flight deck.  STraight to the java machine for a strong brew.
404      The trident seemed to be getting heavier all the time.
405      ** hold it now!!! she said to herself, slapping herself on the face.
406 wack!!  why am i feeling so sorry for myself? knock it off!!! Ok Ive
407 gotten ahold of myself now.  into the chamber for my report.

497      Bard, realizing that even HE was getting lare spots in his eyes reached
498 once more into his pack. After but a moment of rummaging he extract several
499 pairs of sun goggles. (sunGLASSES fall off too easily!)
500    They were quickly distributed among the party & L'homme volunteered to take
501 a pair to Piper.
502 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
503 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
504 "Yes, it does.", I replied to Piper after I had climbed the hill.  From this vantage point I could see for about a 
505 quarter-mile in all directions- and yes, I could see the gateway to the north and the machine only a hundered yards to
506 the south.  Everyone below was milling about a machine of some sort, about 10 meters high.  Wait, someone coming closer.
507 L'homme!  He was wearing a pair of sungoggles to ward off the extreme glare, and was holding another pair.  He waved
508 to us as he climbed up.  Not a bad idea, getting goggles.  L'homme finished the climb and handed the goggles to Piper, 
509 apologizing for not having another pair.  "Quite all right, If my eyes become strained I shall try to summon a pair. 
510 What is that thing down there?", I asked.  Slowly, and with L'homme and Piper taking turns, I was told the rest of the 
511 story.  "What have you done with the word you discovered?", I asked.
512 "Nothing yet.  We were considering that very question.  You wouldn't have an idea, would you?", L'homme asked.
513 "Well, yes, have you tried speaking the word to the machine?"
514 "No...."   Abruptly, a loud explosion from below made the crystal sound as if a hundred thousand wind chimes sounded
515 in unison.  A wave of energy erupted from the machine... it seemed to seek out our bodies and penetrate... A bright
516 streak flew toward me and merged with the remainder of my necklace.  The whole glowed and spat fire, a brilliant torch 
517 amid the shaking crystal.  The energy passed, the machine below was gone... amazingly, no one seemed to be hurt. 
518 "I think someone below just thought of it.", I said.  Another deafening boom signaled the arrival of another earth-
519 shaking occurance...

523      Enraptured by the flames, curling feebly in their eternal seeking
524 for more, she had not noticed the murmer that had whisked through the
525 crowd suddenly, like an eddy of wind that twisted back contrarily...
526 chin cupped in hand and feet drawn under her, she was lost in thought,
527 though her eyes were alive, reflecting the flicker of the dying fire.
528 But the curious hush that descended finally reached her:  she lifted
529 her head, immediately meeting the eyes of the Mesolithic Mathematician.
530 He fairly sparkled with good humour, but there was a curious expectancy
531 about his look that puzzled her; only for a breath of a moment, until
532 she recalled his propensity for thought-projecting from those long-ago
533 days.  Such divergent paths they had taken!  Her smile lit her face
534 as she uncurled herself to greet her old collegue:  "Well-met, Mez!"
535 Jovial and exuberant as ever, he invited her to pull up a rough-hewn
536 bench just as the savoury medly of cinnamon, cherry, apples & cloves
537 drifted near; seeking its source, she espied the Innkeeper and Pam
538 beckoning to an empty chair.  Turning back, she caught that expectant
539 look from Mez again--he didn't remember.  Tilting her head a mite
540 reproachfully, she said only for his ears:  "Touch not the mind, Mez."
541      Suffused with delight, she fairly scampered over to see Pam, dear
542 old friend; she clasped both her hands and implored to hear more tales
543 of adventure, for even by the hearth the talk had ventured.  As Pam
544 began, the slight figure gowned in white sipped the steaming mug that
545 the Innkeeper had brought, the Apprentice's special gift:  it slipped
546 so comfortably into her hands, ever pleasingly-warm, ever full.
547      Pam was in the midst of another story, when "Ah!" exclaimed the
548 lady of dragons, for she had spotted a hesitant figure just inside the
549 door, a girl sporting blue-green blousy trousers and a black jacket.
550 She'd drawn the attention of several near the door, but they seemed 
551 too startled to say anything.  "Excuse me for interrupting, but my
552 friend Tiger appears lost.  I spoke with such warmth of our Inn; she
553 knows naught of the ways of lost times...Please, welcome her!"
554 As she spoke, she fastened her green eyes on Tiger's black ones until
555 the girls found each other.  "Looking relieved, Tiger squirmed through
556 the crowd to their table, and as she came, the Innkeeper inquired if
557 they had supped, indicating his hand toward the kitchen, where he had
558 a cauldren of stew awaiting his guest's appetites.

561 ing greeted the Lady D. and seen her safely to a table of friends
562 and her favorite refreshment the Mez turned back to the conversation at his
563 table. "Now there's one for the books", he said, chuckling aloud. "Memories
564 are such Mobius strips of the mind.", he continued in a lower voice directed
565 at no one in particular.
566      This was the finest gatherings that had been assembled at the Inn for
567 some time. Perhaps we are in the process of creating one of those times that
568 will one day be thought of as 'the good old days', Mez though to himself.
569      Piper, a tune if you choose, to celebrate the occasion, and the drink
570 of your choice, ale if I remember correctly. I'm paying of course. Mez was
571 in a mood for dancing and he remembered the ole' saying, so he thought to pay
572 in advance.

575 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
576  at the inn--
577   With a broad smile, the piper made a bow to Mez.  "He who pays the piper
578 also gets to call the tune, you know." the piper replied quaffing the lees
579 in his mug.  He continued, "but while you are searching for the name of a
580 tune, let's have a medely of dance airs."
581   The piper swung the pipes to his shoulder, the drones spreading out nicely,
582 the left hand holding the chanter.  He put the blowpipe in his mouth, took 
583 a deep breath and blew it into the bag.  The bag was soft and supple, responsive
584 from the playing it had gotten lately.  In fact, the piper noted, it was a bit
585 too supple -- he had the pipes winded now, the drones started, the chanter
586 beginning to sound -- he worried slightly that it would soon be time to replace
587 the bag, would it never end?  Fingers rippling lightly over the holes in the
588 chanter, the piper swung into "Munlochy Bridge", "The Salmon Leap", "Rose 
589 Amongst the Heather", and "The High Road to Linton."
