44 Milchar found himself in a void, an inky black area of indetermiable dimensions.  The Green Stone seemed to have
45 vanished some time ago.  "How I hate booby-traps.  Especially if I am the subject of one of them.", Milchar commented
46 to himself.

62      The  Inn  was quiet and empty.   A distant sound of a  flute 
63 could  be  heard if one listened carefully.   The source  of  the 
64 sound  was  indeterminate,  but  seemed to  come  mainly  in  the 
65 direction  of the rafters.   A huddled dark figure in a corner of 
66 the Inn stired.  Letting out a small groan, he lifted his head to 
67 see where the sound was eminating.  At first, he saw nothing, but 
68 as he watched,  a spot began to glow and grow into a small  elfin 
69 figure  holding  a small flute and sitting crosslegged on one  of 
70 the  support  beams.   Probably just his  imagination,  too  much 
71 drink,  and too long a night.   With a small sigh,  he sat up and 
72 hugged  his  knees  to  his  chest.    Matted  hair  covered  his 
73 bloodshoot  eyes.   He rested his chin on his knees,  closed  his 
74 eyes and breathed a deep sigh.                                    
75      "So,  what's eat'n you hairbrain?"                          
76      Startled,  Tarn  looked up to see the Elfe standing in front 
77 of  him.   "Are  you talking to me?" he asked.                   
78      "You  don't see anyone else in this dump do you?"  the  Elfe 
79 responded,  "It's  a woman isn't it?"  "Yes,  how did you  know?" 
80 Tarn asked.   "It always is...  You never learn do you?    You're 
81 all alike,  a sucker for a kind voice and a warm hand.  Then when 
82 she leaves you think the world has ended.   Well,  I got news for 
83 ya buddy boy,  the world doesn't give a damn about what you think 
84 or  do.   You  could drop dead right this moment,  and the  world 
85 wouldn't even bat an eyelash."  With that the elfe sat back in  a 
86 handy  chair  and laughed.   That was when Tarn noticed that  the 
87 elfe's legs were covered with fur,  and instead of feet,  he  had 
88 hooves.   "Yeah, What do you know?  Do you know what it's like to 
89 find  a  friend  you can talk to and loose  her?   But  then  you 
90 probably  never  have  fallen  in love  with  anyone,  have  you?  
91 Spending  all your time dancing and prancing around in the  woods 
92 like  a bloody fool fairy.   Oh yes,  I know who you  are,  Robin 
93 Goodfellow.  Always out for a good time seducing people with your 
94 flute and then leave them stranded and alone.   Yeah, your a real 
95 fun guy alright."                                                
96      The elfe roared with laughter at the out burst.   "I suppose 
97 you expect me to screem 'Lies!  All Lies!',  but I won't, because 
98 it is true.  You are all such fools, you fall for the simplest of 
99 seductions.  What sillyness! And you call me the fool!"           
100      Tarn was only momentarily taken aback by this verbal assult. 
101 "Never the less,  it doesn't change my feelings, so why don't you 
102 beat it instead of sitting there telling me what a fool I am." 
103      The elfe got up and with a laugh,  snatched up his flute and 
104 danced out the door of the Inn, with music trailing as he went.
105      Tarn  dropped his head to his knees after the elfe had  gone 
106 and sighed.   "Oh Emer,  how I miss you.  I wish I knew where you 
107 were.  I miss your sweet voice and soothing touch. Where have you 
108 gone?  Will I ever see you again?  God, how I miss you."         
109                           *O* Tarn *O*

111 UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
112 Each time I am borne away I learn more about my imperfect soul-travel skills
113 and still more about my imperfect soul. I went to a farming village in
114 South America so remote that the people did not speak of their country but
115 only of their tribe so I know only that the land was high and dry and that
116 the air was thin and clear and that I slept without dreaming perhaps because
117 I was tired and perhaps because the fabric of my life had become a dream.
118 Someone's mind had entered mine or my mind experienced someone's body or
119 some dream was having me rather than the reverse. The person I was one with
120 had such a feel for the earth that I could feel the moods, the will, the
121 very breath of the soil.  We used clumsy tools, unbalanced and dull, but I
122 learned to get beyond the blisters and bruises to a state of harmony where
123 I could exert my will on the earth and could in turn receive the deep
124 power and sweetness of the land. My dream-mate was deeply religious and
125 every part of life was soaked in art and ritual--a certain way to arrange
126 food on the plate, to tie the long belts with the mysterious designs, a way
127 to bathe children to keep them safe, a way to speak to old people. And if
128 everything was done perfectly, life was safe.  The demons of earth and forest
129 and sky could not penetrate the web of sacred acts.  We sought to perfect
130 our rites, my dreamer and I, in every movement and thought.  And so it was
131 that We were swinging a scythe allowing the weight of the tool, the resistance
132 of grain to tell us how to move, teaching us perfect humility, perfect grace,
133 perfect clarity with every stroke so that on one backswing in which we became
134 the instrument and the earth and air the user, we were suddenly for an infin-
135 ity and for no time the fulcrum, the point of axis about which revolved many
136 worlds and light flooded in to my completely inadeqate brain-soul and I lost
137 not only the moment of clarity, but my fellow traveler as well.  I now found
138 myself in a rocky region near a cave.  I could smell food cooking, but could
139 see no smoke.

188   From Prometheus: Ill-Gotten
189   QUIZMASTER; You must admit the naure of your entry was at best dark humor. It is easily interpretable as bigotry. Even if it
190 was not conceived as such.
191   TRAVELLER; Do you still frequent Backwater? Lack of response will of course be considered as you not.
192   THE MAD ACTOR; I enjoyed our discussion greatly. Perhaps it should be done again sometime. I decided against being classy.
193   MURDER CONSEQUENTIAL; Thank you for considering me, I would enjoy that. I'll follow your lead.
194   MAN IN GRAY; Would anyone have told you about the shakiness of having one apple continuously?
195   AARON; If you would, pleas, respond about the forthcoming pente game. Preliminary grid size is 17 intersections by the same.
196   BW REWRITERS; Please include a mu;liple command character. That would be of immense aid, both in time and well; frustration.

200 Well, well, my last upload seems to have annoyed some people.  Unfortunately,
201 I can't take credit for its authorship--it's something that has been circulating
202 rather widely lately.  However, I do subscribe the philosophy indicated by it.
203 Call it bigotry if you want, labels are merely words.  To be perfectly
204 blunt, one of my favorite fantasies is to lead a 'Nam type air strike
205 on Rajneesh Puram. 
206 Mark - if Back Water sickens you so much, you are cordially invited to depart.

219 QUIZMASTER: THOUGH I THOUGHT MARK WAS A BIT OVER EMOTIONAL I ALSO THOUGHT
220 HE HAD A GOOD POINT. BACKWATER HAS GENERALLY BEEN KNOWN FOR ITS TOLERANCE 
221 AND REJECTION OF BIGOTRY AND PREJUDICE. I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S MUCH 
222 CONSTRUCTIVE IN YOUR HATEFUL ATTITUDE. PERHAPS IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE 
223 THAT YOU SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE. THERE'S ENOUGH FRICTION HERE WITHOUT 
224 YOU FANNING THE FLAMES. BIGOTRY AND HATE MONGERING HAVE NO PLACE AT THE INN.
225 WHY DON'T YOU BE A GOOD AND MOVE ON. THE RED NECKS OF EASTERN OREGON 
226 NEED YOU MORE THAN US. MAX

229 Mark: The "hatemongering" that Quizmaster put up is circulating ALL OVER THE CITY!
230 I saw the SAME text a week ago. I've talked to others who've seen it elsewhere.
231 I admit the humor is heavy-handed & in bad taste but....
232      In any case, while I would not approve of physical assaults on the Rajneesh
233 people, they ARE obnoxious BIGOTS! Just listen to Sheela or most of their other
234 spokesmen.

236 Mikey: the missing lines (241-262) were CRs and a lone "HELP".

238 Leonard: I agree that there is bigotry on both sides. My objection is
239 in using the Inn to fan the flames of hatred. It's a terrible situation all 
240 around. I lose patience with those who actively try to make it worse. I've 
241 never been very tolerant of bigitry of any sort. I'm afraid I'm not very 
242 tolerant of this kind...even if the whole state believes in it.

253               I defy anyone to prove themselves not.)  I have a hard time

263 The travelling companion was indeed very hungry.  "Have you not eaten recently ?", I queried.  "Yes, I have, but I
264 also worked very hard at my last place.  I just wish that I could stay in one place for a length of time.", she 
265 replied.
266 "Perhaps we can work on that together, it would help if you would tell me your story, and what your journey is for."
267 "May I have another muffin ?"  
268      Buttering the muffin, she told me a most incredible story, about just concentrating, and then being there.  I
269 believe she was telling me the truth, and I am rarely mistaken in such things.  I asked, "But, why have you chosen
270 this particular path ?  Is there something you need to learn here ?  May I help you ?  Are you here to help me ?  I
271 have a thousand questions, but even more basic, what may I call you ?"

276 For some reason, I find myself disliking 'neesies also, but am at a loss to back up my feeling.  I cannot name any
277 one thing that they have done that I wholly disapprove of, unless you count Sheela.  Another thought:  Listening to 
278 Z-100 this week, I find a lot of satire about 'neeshies... Rajneesh Dangerfield, the debate between John McEnroe an
279 Sheela... the list goes on.

281 Milchar found himself dreaming while wide awake, a startling experience by itself, but the nature of the dreams were 
282 strange also...
283 (Scene One:)  Friar Mossback speaking with an old woman, and the woman teleporting to the south end of the valley.  The
284 Friar follows.
285 (Scene Two:)  A disfigured gentleman finds the Gazebo and levels it with dark emerald blasts of force originating from
286 his fingertips.  He wears a necklace made of a string of Emeralds.
287 (Scene Three:)  Piper is sitting on an outcropping of rock at the west end of the Valley, quite near the Valley 
288 perimeter.  Flies off in search of the others.
289 (Scene Four:)  A robed figure is standing amidst a field of transparent pinnacles, seeming to absorb a strange energy 
290 from them.
291 (Scene Five:)  Milchar is drifting in a void, but now there is a hole in the void, milky-white... Milchar is drawn 
292 toward it...
293 DRAWN TOWARD IT!?!
294 Milchar came instantly awake, to find himself in the exact situation as he had dremt it.  Summoning his will, he found
295 spell-casting much easier here... A short blast of argent checked his forward momentum, but the two forces meeting 
296 created a temporary gate... Milchar promptly used it, and found himself...
297 At a door.  "Knock three times before entering.", the sign read.
298 Looking about, Milchar found that he was at the very southern point of the Ruby Valley... back in "normal" space!
299 Milchar had little time to think on this, however, as another explosion rocked the ground.  "The Gazebo... leveled, as
300 predicted.  Is this the door I saw in the Great Map?  Is THIS my destiny?"
301 Milchar crossed his fingers, and knocked thrice.
302 +++++++++++++++++ Milchar ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 10:32 on 10/21/84 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
303 Distrusting and mocking the Rajneeshi is not bigotry.  It's good sense. More-
304 over, Mark, if you are as tolerant as you purport to be, have some tolerance
305 for us bigots.  A true sanyasin scorns sympathy and respects a healthy sense of
306 irreverence.  The satires don't bother the Rajneeshi; why should they bother
307 you? You're right to try to keep BWMS entries of good quality, but many feel
308 that in this case using reason is madness,
309 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Asleep at the Wheel ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
310 if we really want to see how un-bigoted we all are, let's invite Frank back
311 for a discussion

313 ******************************************************************
314 I MIGHT NOTE THAT TOLERANCE TOWARDS OTHERS INCLUDES TOLERANCE TO 
315 THEIR IDEAS WETHER YOU AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT. BIGOTRY IS A VERY
316 DIFFICULT THING TO DEFINE IN REAL APPLICATION. DISLIKE OF A GROUPS
317 ACTIONS AS A WHOLE DOES NOT ENTAIL BIGOTRY. BIGOTRY IS PREDETERMINING
318 ONES LIKE OR DISLIKE OF ANOTHER PERSON OR GROUP WITHOUT EVIDENCE 
319 TO PROVE THAT DISLIKE. IF YOU HAVE VALID REASONS FOR DISLIKING SOMEONE
320 OR GROUP, THAT IS NOT BIGOTRY. SO OF COURSE NOW COMES THE PROBLEM
321 OF DECIDING IF YOUR IDEAS OF EVIDENCE ARE REASONABLE OR NOT. SO
322 YOU CAN SEE WHAT A DIFFICULT THING BIGOTRY IS TO DEFINE. OF COURSE
323 IN EXTREEM CASES IT IS EASY TO POINT AND SAY BIGOT. SUCH AS SAYING
324 THAT JUST BECAUSE YOUR SKIN IS A DIFFERENT COLOR OR YOU PROFESS TO
325 A DIFFERENT RELIGON THAT YOU ARE INFERIOR.

337 The Poet looked around the valley in which he found himself. There was a structure in the distance, just barely
338 visible. In the other direction was a might mountain range. "Hmm," thought he, "I may be able to find some help or
339 advice near that building," and he began walking in that direction. Suddenly the building disappeared in a violent
340 burst of energy. "On the other hand, those mountains look mightily inviting." He turned and began double-timing
341 towards the tall, rocky horizon.

345   After thouroughly warming his mount's flying muscles the piper was warm
346 himself.  (I hope the local grammarians don't spot that comma fault)
347   He packed his bedding back into his sporran and tightened his kilt straps
348 another notch.  Peg was getting restless -- the massage had stimulated the
349 great flying muscles and she indicated her impatience to be going with many
350 nudges and nuzzles.  The piper leaped to her back, just behind her front 
351 shoulders, and locked his knees under the root of her wings.  The mighty wings
352 were stretched out now, twenty feet to each side, the pegasus sweeping them
353 slowly through the air.  Slowly, the pegasus increased her wing sweep; the
354 huge pinions brushing the ground at the downstroke, moving higher and higher on
355 the upstroke.  Quivering with eagerness, the pegasus began to rear up with 
356 each downstroke, actually moving the wings below her body, causing the piper
357 to grip her neck.  She gave a ringing cry, dropped her front feet to the ground,
358 raised her wings high, then galloped and leaped off the pinnacle.  For a long 
359 moment, she held her wings high, picking up airspeed, then slowly extended them
360 into the passing air.  Slowly, and with exquisite care, she transformed their
361 headlong fall into a controlled dive, then with a force that tried to push the
362 piper through her shoulders, she was in straight and level flight.  
363   The flew high, and caught the heat of the morning sun.  It burned the grey
364 haze of sleep from their minds and bodies, and the pegasus and her rider began
365 to frolic high in the morning sky.  Caught up in their play, both were taken
366 unaware by the explosion below.

368 ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL: Though I never considered myself a true Sanyasin, 
369 I certainly can't argue with having a healthy respect for irreverence. 
370 The emphasis being on healthy. 
371 
372 But this is not a situation of healthy irreverence. This is a situation 
373 of people making provocative statements during a very volatile situation. 
374 They are bating for violence, and that is entirely different than 
375 demonstrating healthy irrevence. 
376 
377 If the satires don't bother the Rajneeshis, then why are they carrying 
378 automatic weopons? Would a true Sanyasin demonstrate such "healthy" 
379 irreverence if he knew it might lead to increased hatred, bigotry, 
380 and violence? If so, I take pride in being an unbeliever.

385 Laissssez ---I found the time and nature of your return, to the entry mode,
386      to be interesting. Yes, you are indeed confused. I've not been one of
387      those engaged in the ravings about the eastern Oregon spiritual commune.
388      It would seem that the newspapers, TV, radio, and numerous messages on
389      computers systems around town, have covered most of the considerations
390      both pro and con. A poor backwoods philosopher, such as myself, would
391      find little to add to such a weighty mass of utterings. Did you have
392      some more subtle intent that escaped me? If so speak up Lad. As if to
393      defy my previous statement, the following observation seems appropriate.
394      If someone had wished to devise a test of the laws of Oregon, as well as
395      the tolerance of the population, they would have been hard pressed to
396      create a more definitive situation than this one. A great deal has been
397      revealed.
398 
399 All ---Backwater was not a place that I would have expected to see some of
400      the entries of the last few days. To paraphrase a famous writer,
401      Violence, or advocating violence, is the last refuge of the ignorant.
402      Certainly many people feel threatened by new ideas and especially new
403      social concepts. This tendency seems to be more prevalent in those who
404      have not had the opportunity to travel and experience other cultures
405      and ways of living. I submit that there are more appropriate responses,
406      to this fear, than advocating violence.

To those concerned about whether or not we treating the BVog whine and his followers with respect : Lest we all 
411 forget, the good book warns of such people and their followers. I can't picture the good right hand of God or God 
412 
himself advocating the kind of behavior I have witnessed from these people. Their goal has been from the beginn8ing,
413 
i believe,to take over a township by sheer numbers an expand from there. As we have all seen from the papers and TV
414 
this is just what they are accomplishing. I believe that every naturalised or native born US citizen has a right to
415 speak his or her piece and do as they please, so long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. By calling 
416 all Oregonians bigots etc.... the demonstration is that they have no respect for anyone who isn't of their party or
417 
belief. Unfortunately, this smacks of bigotry also. I would have been content to let sleeping dogs lay  if it weren't
418 
for their present apparent course. This has left the area of just buyilding a quiet little commune to taking over
419 a considerably large portion of the county that they are now established in. And to top it all off they purprot to
420 be a religous group. Ever hear the saying that politics and religion don't m ix? Well in this case i believe it. 
421 
The contoversy over voter registration in Wasco county is a prime example of what I am trying to illustrate. I guess
422 my over all feeling is that the guru and his peop,le should have stayed in the religion business and out of government.

447     Just as the alchemist emerged from the hatch a large, winged creature
448 flew across the face of the sun. As it passed close aboard the port side it
449 let out a squawk that gave him goose bumps over his entire body. Glancing
450 down, he suddenly realized that in his haste he had forgotten to put on any
451 clothes. There he stood naked, shivering in the cool morning mist. It wasn't
452 modesty but discomfort that sent him diving back down the hatch. Drawing a
453 blanket around his shoulders, he went over to the port porthole to see what
454 manner of bird inhabited these northern bays. Sailing across the mist, that
455 was rising off the water, it looked mysterious and somewhat prehistoric.
456 Its blue-gray body tapered gracefully to a white face and long pointed beak,
457 obviously designed for fishing. All this was punctuated by an intense yellow
458 eye that seemed to look right inside you.
459     The great bird swooped low over the water, nearing the shore it flared
460 its wings and landed, standing in the water on long stick-like legs. While
461 he dressed the practitioner continued to observe this amazing creature. Such
462 grace and beauty was truly a sight for the gods. Ah!, he suddenly recalled,
463 it's the legendary Great Blue Heron. The heron was now standing perfectly
464 still, knee deep in water, looking intently at the water's surface. It was
465 either admiring its own great beauty, reflected in the mirror surface, or it
466 was fishing for breakfast. As he was thinking this the heron reached down with
467 its long beak and plucked a small feather from its chest. It stretched its
468 long neck to the limit and carefully dropped the feather on the surface of
469 the water, then began peering intently at the feather. With a sudden flash a
470 fish broke the surface and grabbed the feather in its mouth. Just as quickly
471 the heron had the fish in its beak. A quick flick of the head lined up fish
472 and beak. A few gulps and the fish was transformed into instant breakfast.
473 He was amazed at what he had just seen. A bird that makes its own fishing
474 tackle.                                                                    
475     "Ahoy Southwind"                                                           
476                                                            "Ahoy Southwind"
477     Oh, that's right, someone had been calling from the beach. Looking out
478 the starboard porthole, he could just make out a shape under the trees.
479 Perhaps he was going to have company on the walk to the Inn.

482 All:    I don't know whether other people have noticed this or not, but it
483 	seems that in most of the violent statements about the Senyasin (sp?)
484 	have been directed towards the people themselves rather than the people
485 	you love to hate (Sheela and the big guy).  It seems that all too often
486 	the people in general of a disliked group are put on the chopping block
487 	rather than the people that you >>know<< you dislike.  Has anyone else
488 	noticed this?
489 <(::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::)>
490 I DON'T KNOW WHO THE SENYASIN ARE, PLEASE EXPLAIN. PERHAPS A HERBAL BLEND TEA?
491 SIGNED, PROHA ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
492 A couple of points in response to some of the above entries:
493 1. I can't judge the Rajneeshies by their beliefs as I am not aware what those
494    beliefs are. I can judge SOME of the beliefs of their spokesmen (ie we are
495    all stupid, etc..). From the apparent lack of complaints by Rajneeshies about
496    the way their spokesmen carry on, I can make the quite reasonable assumption 
497    that they agree.
498 2. I can also judge by their actions. The Automatic weapons (which showed up
499    BEFORE any major provocations), the attempts to stuff the ballot box (yyes,
500    I know they said that it was a coincidence that they quit shipping people
501    in when it would be too late to register them. Do YOU believe that? If so,
502    I have this real estate deal....), etc.

506 time to type in a message.
507 MiG:
508 	How is the board going?  Got a number yet?
509 
510 About the rajneeshie problem.  Maybe we could start some nuclear testing in
511 the southern part of Oregon, right around antolope is a good place to start.
512 Maybe the russians wouldn't mide have a good accuracy test on the big line
513 of Rollsroices down there.  NUKE THE SUCKERS!  A couple napalms?  Couple
514 M1 tanks rolling by could take a few shots.  How about we aim a few CBMs
515 in that general direction and make it into a national land fill?
516 	I know this can be taken a few ways, I don't feel this strongly
517 about the whole thing but I think they are getting too many advantages.
518 If you or I went out into our front yard and built a wooden shed for some
519 tools the state would be right there demanding a permit.  If you didn't
520 have one you would have to tear down your construction.  Why don't they
521 enforce the law in Antalope?  We are finally getting on the ball when the
522 people in the courts do something they shouldn't have done.  Like today they
523 moved the sight of the hearings closer to the Rasjneeshie home.  Why?
524 No good reason, they are BagWons!   Why can we let them get away with all
525 that?  It's not all our fault but we must take a little blame for why they
526 are getting off scott-free.  Personaly, I like all of the jokes that are
527 going around, they are funny.  The views that Sheela has I don't agree with
528 one bit, how she can say them is over my head.  It's like watching one
529 of thos Christian channels with the guy saying "Save GOD!  Give MONEY,
530 TO ME!", it's just as bad.  Well, my little soap box is in tough shape.

566 "Come in.", a soft voice said behind the door.
567 Milchar opened the door slowly, and took in the view behind it.  The door opened into a large room, perfectly formed
568 into a shape of a four-sided pyramid.  At the crown of the ceiling was a strange rainbow-colored stone, at present 
569 swirling its colors about erraticly.  At the other three sides of the room, there were three other doors, each exactly
570 alike in appearance.  The source of the voice was not apparent.
571 But it spoke again.  "Ahhh, a Seeker.  Wouldst thy like a token of your accomplishment?"
572 "I don't understand.  What's a Seeker?  What have I accomplished?", Milchar queried, shaking his head.
573 "A Seeker is one who looks for something.  Are you not seeking answers, and other things?"
574 "Yes, Do you have the answers?"
575 "No.  Your second question also has an answer: you accomplished a transition.  Can you cast a spell now?"
576 Milchar concentrated, focused his will, and failed.  Another try, another failure.  "What...why...", he sputtered.
577 A necklace of fine Rubies shimmered into being around Milchar's neck.  "This is your token.  Ward it well.  Also, your
578 spells... they are gone.  Only one power still lies in your grasp, but you only know the tip of its abilities. 
579 Farewell..."
580 The being was silent, or not present.  Milchar sighed, another quest to follow.  It seemed he followed a large train of
581 quests.  Milchar was getting tired.
582 Abruptly, the necklace began to glow.  A trail of crimson light flew from the centerstone in the necklace through the
583 door Milchar had come in, up and out of sight.  "I suppose I follow that..."

586 Don't give the bawgwan too much credit for original thinking. All the rajneeshies did in registering dead
587 people was copy a fine tradition made famous by the democrates and the Daily machine in Chicago many years
588 ago. Just ask Richard Nixon what he feels about the voting practices in the city that Mike Royko hails from.
589 For all the bad things you can say about the Rajneeshies, one thing you can't say about them is that they
590 are stupid. When you consider that a vast majority of the followers of the bawgwan are professional people soured
591 on the opacity of their lives, it is not hard to imagine how they have so far outsmarted and out maneuvered the
592 good people of Oregon. The 1001 Friends of Oregon has been able to do very little in their efforts to check the 
593 expansion of Rajneesh Puram. Not until the big guns in Salem opened fire did Shiela and company start hitting snags.
594 If you stand back and clear your head of hate and bigotry, and look and see what they have accomplished in only
595 a couple years, albeit they have used every legal dirty trick in the book, it is actually quite remarkable. They
596 have used the media like no one since the afore mentioned President Nixon. They have dodged more bullets in
597 court than a 60 Minutes camera crew. And even when Bawg himself is "hauled" into court, he gets away with
598 calling his questioners "stupid". They have shown incredible gall, and an unbelievable amount of deceit to boot. And
599 yet not until very recently have they really been stopped in their tracks. A remarkable record if you ask me. How do
600 they do it? Again look at their makeup. Look who they have on their side. The same thing we have on our side. The
601 US constitution. A document written nearly 200 years ago. A document that should be burned according to Ma Prem
602 Sunshine. A document that has saved their collective behinds more times than one cares to admit. To quote Micheal

609 masterwork getting trashed near 100%
610    Actually, I think that whooz'erface from that generally despised joint may
611 have proved her point about "stuipid" and "bigot".  She has at least 90% of
612 the vocal people demonstrating these traits in abundance.
613    It reminds me of the story of the red monkey.  It seems that a group of
614 biologists painted a monkey red then returned it to its habitat.  Why?  Just
615 to see what happened.  What happened, you ask?  The other monkeys in the band
616 tore it to pieces.  It seems that putting on a red costume elicits the same
617 response in the monkey's "more advanced" cousins.
