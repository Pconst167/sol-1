210   and looking around I saw, nothing.  It's hard to describe, but try to 
211 picture a light blue nothing...  well, anyway, that's where I found 
212 my self.  Smack dab in the middle of light blue nothing.
213   Now pull your self together Trevor, I tell my self.
214   just because the whole world is a light blue and there isn't anything to see
215  but blue. No shadows or anything.  It isn't like the end of the world..
216   Well, maybe a little...
217   So I started looking around for something, anything, anything at all...
218   After some time, hard to tell how long, I found something.
219   of all things, a light switch?  okay, here goes everything.
220       'click'
221   and the world was sort of there.  I was in a room of some large size with
222 at least one wall nearbye and light coming from somewhere above.
223   So, I set out along the wall to see if I could find a door.
224  
225    And after what had to be a mile of wall I found a 'door'.  At least that'S
226 what I called it.  A large triangle of metal set into the wall.
227    I tried to find some sort of latch or handle or .....  anything to open the
228  door with.  Okay, I told myself, It's a door, so how do doors open.
229    Ever felt like an idiot because you left your head on the night stand?
230    I did right then.
231    The door pushed open and I looked out on a grassy field with animals and
232 birds and everything a spring day should have.

265 I look out and see across the clearing
266 a once beutifull inn that is now slowly falling into disuse. Where once there
267 were many happy voices now there is only the echo of years that have passed.
268  
269 A man sits outside staring up at the sky. It is the innkeeper. A man who has
270 seen many wonderfull things in his day. He has went through changes, always 
271 with the air of one who knew that werever he was the world would be alive and
272 wonderfull.
273  
274 But now, he wonders what has happened. His friends no longer come and he has
275 seen only shadows for the longest time. Occasionally he thinks he hears the
276 voices of men and women from the past who have told many great tales. But
277 then as he listens closer they fade away and are gone.
278  
279 He looks up to the sky and wonders what could have happened to so many good

574  
575 The beuty of the sunrise was nothing compared to the beuty of the lake. It 
576 radiated a magic that only the most cynical could miss. There was about
577 it a very deep green grass that no doubt contained rabits and gofers and
578 other furry creatures of the ground.
579  
580 The surface rippled in a slow and gentle motion, causing the water flowers
581 to gengtly wave back and forth. A fish jumped and a unlucky insect became 
582 dinner.
583  
584 The soft glow at night was strange but not frightening and in the light of
585 day manifested itself as a silvery sheen that made the water seem clearer 
586 then even the clearest glass.
587  
588 On the western side of the field that surronded the lake was a large Inn. 
589 Beside the Inn was a large old tree that seemed to speak out stories with
590 its branches.
591  
592 Out of the chimney came faint whisps of smoke and the sounds of conversation
593 could be heard inside.

599 I sit in the Inn and listen. There is somthing of an air to the place. I could
600 feel a certain somthing in the walls.
601  
602 The woodwork was not all that outstanding, but it had a gritiness to it that
603 made one feel. The past/future disonated through me and I saw/felt a name
604 in the air. It floated for a moment and then was gone, into the mist that
605 had spewed it out. 
606  
607 I did/do what I must and have/will taken the risks. Things cleared and the
608 moments become one. It is now and I know that I am here in the present.
609  
610 I continue to sit at the corner table, the sound of guitars and even lutes
611 play in the air. 
612  
613 The link crackles by my ear and I feel the pull that will means I must 
614 return.
615  
616 A pull and I am back in my seat. I pull out the plug and look bleary eyed at
617 the dump that is my home in the normal world. The door buzzer continus to
618 attack me and I am forced to rise. I look at the viewer and see a face.
619  
620 "Hey man, it's bleary. Let me in, I think theres a cp after me!"
621  
622 I press the buttons and let the fool in. "You A**h*ole, I told you this

633         Hum a tune.  Repeat it.  Do this until boredom rears its ugly
634 head, but do not relent; continue for eight hours a day, not stopping
635 during meals, either.  Pretty soon you're humming it whether you want to
636 or not.  That's what they wanted, of course.
637         My first month of training in Magick passed like this; a different
638 tune every day, the first thirty Basic Spells.  Nothing else is taught for
639 the first month- there is a lot of silly worrying about uncontrolled Power.
640         On the first day of the second month, all of the new 'prentices
641 were allowed to pick a musical instrument, a focusing device for conjuring.
642 It is a weighy problem- you want something small and easy to carry, but if
643 you already have a talent for an instrument, you should choose that.  Our
644 choices weren't limited to the instruments of our dimension, fortunately;
645 but familiar ones such as the harp and the lute had the advantage of being
646 less intimidating.  My choice was already made, weeks ago.  The pan flute.
647 Not of my dimension, but it had a haunting quality that touched me deeply.
648 Not to mention the coincedence of names.
649         After the choosing, my friend Merryl proudly displayed his choice.
650         "It's a Har-mohn-ik-ah," said he.  It certainly was small, and the
651 noise it produced resembled a tortured version of the intense humming of
652 last month.
653         "What have you chosen, Pan?"
654         "A flute of another world."  I let him read the label.
655         "Pan's flute, indeed!"  He laughed.  "An omen of some sort, I am
656 certain.  How is your skill with it?"
657         I showed him.  I surprised myself, actually; the flute seemed made
658 for me.  A few dozen notes clove the air and I felt, for the first time
659 since I went into training, the internal SNAP of my Power coming to life.
660 The dormitory Merryl and I stood in grew indistinct.  I was a minstrel
661 before a mage "discovered" my talent and brought me to Dunbarrah for
662 training- and this showed.  I continued with my improvised song, enthralled
663 with my sudden proficency.
664         "Pan!" Merryl sounded panicked.
665         I looked up.  The dormitory wasn't visible; Merryl and I were alone
666 in a milky haze.  Shocked, I stopped playing.  The world snapped back into
667 view.
668         Merryl and I stood between spires of stone and glass, on a street of
669 brick.  A thunder assaulted my ears.  I spun to face a demon mounted on wheels,
670 spraying saliva and chewing upon the bricks, about to make a meal of us...

727 Here's the first part of my next story. I'm going to try the upload route.
728  
729      Patrick looked out of his window at the backyard. It was not large in
730 reallity, but it held an imaginary world that was far larger then any phsical
731 boundry. It was squere and aproximetly fourty by twenty feet with the long 
732 side towards the house.
733      In the far right hand corner was a small fountain. It trickled water
734 and was along its sides over grown with algy. In the far left hand corner
735 was a dog house. It had belonged to Cymry, a large german shepherd. Cymry
736 had dissapered just before Patrics 16th birthday a year earlier. It had
737 been nearly a year before that that his parents had dissapered. 
738      Somthing bad always seemed to happen around his birthday. In the
739 center of the yard was a small cherry tree. It was surronded by a raised
740 patio on which several pieces of randomly placed lawn furniture lived.
741      The rest of the yard with the exception of the back deck and the path
742 to the cetral patio was thick green grass. That was the reallity.
743      In his mind Patrick saw the fountain as a beutifull waterfall, at the 
744 base of which lived a group of the wee folk. Even now he imagined he saw them 
745 darting about playfully.
746      The Tree was in fact a Treant. Who, would occasionally tell him long
747 meandering stories about the Earth.
748     The Dog House was a large friendly building from which he would 
749 hear strange a beutifull music.
750     He sighed and turned from the window. 
751 is Grandmother had come to live with him After his parents had dissapered.
752 Things had been ok since then but he wished he knew were they were. Grandma
753 had told him once that they were probably dead.
754     He wasn't sure wether he believed that or not. Growing restless he
755 went to his desk and opened a drawer at random. There sat the disk with his 
756 history report. What was that in the corner? Oh great! he thought pulling
757 out the small green orb his uncle had given him for christmas.
758      "Well, atleast I have the hardcopy!" He thought as he eyed the orb. It
759 had arrived in the mail just a few days before the previose christmas with
760 a note from his uncle saying it was a focus or somthing like that. He'd never
761 met his Uncle so the gift was a suprise.
762      So far the only thing he had found it usefull for was erasing floppy 
763 disks and warping the picture on the tv. "I think I'd better find some
764 place safe to put this thing." He said. 
765      He walked over to his closet and pulled on his jaket and took out his
766 mini backpack, placing the orb inside it. It was a saterday and he had 
767 finished his homework the night before.
768      "It's about time I checked out that strange building." He thought walking
769 from his bedroom, through the hallway into the livingroom and from there
770 into the kitchen. He opened the cupboard and pulled out some peanut butter,
771 bread and jam. The making of the two sandwhiches was a sort of ritual. Never
772 go on an expadition without suplies.
773      Next he went to the fridge and pulled out a can of pepsi and two 
774 oranges. Looking around the cool interior he spoted some muffins and took 
775 two of them out as well. He wrapped everything up and inserted the items
776 one by one into his backpack.
777      Outside the glass door to his left was the pourch and the gateway to
778 the other places.
779      He shouldered his pack and walked the few steps neccesary and opened 
780 the door. Steping outside he looked around. The yard was empty but bright
781 with the light of early morning. The air was chill with the last tendrills
782 of winter were in the air.
783      He walked over to the raised bridge that was the path to the treant 
784 and crossed. 
785      As he approached the tree it began to move slowly as if coming out
786 of a deep sleep. "Treant, do you wish to speak to me?" He asked walking up
787 to it.
788      "YYYYEEEESSS, YYYOOOUUU AARRE GOINg on a long journey." It said 
789 coming slowly up to humen spead.
790      "No, a short one, I'd imagine that I'll be back by this afternoon."
791      "Perhaps, but my roots tell me otherwise. The soil does not lie
792 young one."
793      Patric looked disturbed. "How long a trip?"
794      "Oh, that is hard to say. Time is so different for the two of us. I
795 think that anytime is a long time for you."
796      Patrick sighed in relief. "That is so I suppose. I'll see you before the 
797 next setting of the sun."
798     "Wait humen, I wish to give you a gift." This was followed by a crack
799 as a strangly straight and narrow stick about 6 feet long fell from above.
800      "What is this for?" Patric asked.
801      "YOUURRR TTTTRRRRRIIIIIPPPPP" Was all the tree said before subsiding.
802      Patrick shrugged and picked up the stick, grasping it tightly in his 
803 right hand.

809 Very impressive storywriting going on here.... AD, your story is going
810 very well. It's okay that you went on to another story, if you didn't like
811 the other one too much then it would be better to move on because when
812 you don't like what you are writing it usually will turn out bad <although
813 that other story was good too>. Continue the one that you started today,
814 however, I would like to see where it goes... Hmm, well then I guess that
815 is it. Keep up the good work AD!

826 I moved in slowly on the synthetic reallity that was the net. Blearys 
827 problem ran through my mi~d. Being tagged by the cp's was no laughing
828 mater. I'd almost been caught and tagged a time or two myself. Taging
829 is not real high on my list of things to experience. In fact it's right
830 after castration.
831  
832 I decided I'd betteb0chesk things out to see just how bad they were.
833  
834 I started to skate over the icy blue surface of the net. Enjoying the
835 feel of the Electrons as they speed by beneth my feet. In the distance
836 I could see several towers. One of them was0dhe0Central data-base. I
837 prepared myself for the coming assault. 
838  
839 My first action was to activate my personaly written code generator. 
840 "What you want Kit?" It asked me as it came on line.
841  
842 "We're going to be doing a littlu breaking of the central Data-Base
843 pal."
844  
845 "Oh, that easy. You don't need me Kit."
846  
847 "Sure I do. It's easy for a reason. We're going after the real stuff, not
848 the stuff they leave lying around on the surface."
849  
850 "Oh,0deep probe. Why did you not say so in the first place? It will be fun!"
851  
852 "Sure dude, just try to contain your enthusiasm and concentrate on the task
853 at hand."
854  
855 "Sorry Kit."
856  
857 "Oh hell, thats ok. Didn't mean to be so tough n you."
858  
859 "It's Ok, I understand."
860  
861 I went to sub surface travel and felt my body moving down a stream of
862 pulsing electrons. Now I was a Fish moving towards my destination.
863  
864 I found a silent circuit and started to0gork on it.
865  
866 "I want you to be ready to jump in Kit."
867  
868 "Ok."
869  
870 The reality reformed and I was in a room that was looked like somthing
871 out of one of those you see in movies about the 60's. There were
872 posters on the0gallc and all that stuff, as well as the faint smell
873 of drugs.
874  
875 There was only one door out and I walked across and broke it down. Beyond
876 it was another room similer to the first. The only difference being the 
877 large Cop with the ~ight Stick. I quickly activated my Mark five 
878 fighter program and ducked to the side. 
879  
880 The two of them went at each other and locked in mortal combat. I found 
881 it momentarily humerose to see a large hippy and a cop beating on each
(82 other. The fight was short and grusome for the guard program. I deactivated
883 the Mark five and continued on.

928 ...............>...
929 She dreamed often of a house.  It was an old house, on a lonely country
930 road overlooking a small stream.  Dogwood trees kept its porch in cool 
931 shade, and magnolia twisted and twined its way up the colums.  It was
932 a very empty house< bet she knew that there was one room that was lit
933 and warm, even in the dead of winter.  When she awoke she would have the
934 odd sensation of having been watched, and her heart would be racing.  
935 She dreamed this same dream every night for mnths, until it became
936 a part of the night, as expected as starlight and owl calls.
937    On a   late spring day she rode out of town to visit her sister
938 who lived a few  furlongs to the west.  It was a perfect day, and 
939 sparrows heralded0her destriers every move.  She decided to take 
940 the old rode, which she had never ridden before.  It winded through
941 the woods, the ancient woods which ages before were ancient home to
942 Elves; their ancestrial wakening place.  But that was on|i story to be
943 told after the days work had been finished, when the children were ready 
944 for bed.  just as her grandfather had done.
945    These woods were silent.  There was no sound of bird or beast.
946 It was the silence of sleep, the slee`0of q new born babe, or an
947 elderof the village.  It was silent so that one could hear the 
948 trees grow.  almost percieve their subterranean conversation.
949    For hours she wandered in eldrich daze.  The setting sun reminded
950 her of her oriwina| plans, and she found the road once again.  
951 It finally emerged form the forest, overlooking a small stream.
952 Looking up, the suns dying rays fell on an old country house, with
953 magnolia entwined around its colums and dogwood sading the porch.
954 She rode up to the steps, dismounted, and slowly, quiently, stepped 
955 up the porch steps to the house of these long months dreams.
956 In Silence, heart full of fears, and of questions she stood.  How 
957 could it be?  Dreams cannot stant in front of the waking dreamer.
958 This was the place of nighttime, of moonbeams and fireflies, not of
959 daylight hours.  Such thoughts raced through her mind, and she did not
960 see the fron door open, and the old woman step through.
961   "Come yn, shild.  Though you will not find a great hospitality.
962 These old rooms once were filled with laughter and noise.  Now they
963 are silent.  But you must know that."
964   "But Why?  What is this place?  And why is it now empty?"
965 The womans fqce wrew distant, as she recalled times gone by.  "An inn,
966 my dear.  This once was an inn.  In acient times it was the first
967 neutral territory between Men and Elves.  In more recent times, it
968 has been a comfortable place to stay on a journey, or just as an
969 adventure in itself."
970    "and what has happened?  Why does it now stand empty??" She nearly
971 cried, needing, but not wanting to know the answer.
972    "It has become haunted."
973    "By......."
974    "By YOU......"
9750............................
976  and now you have had my meager offering.  Another round, inn keeper!!
977 there will be much rejoicing this night!!!
