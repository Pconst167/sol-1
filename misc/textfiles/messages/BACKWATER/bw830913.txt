49 SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF YOU ARE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS.  PERHAPS PAUL DID THAT DOWNLOAD, BUT PERHAPS NOT.  IT WASN'T
50 SIGNED, SO WHO KNOWS?  AND WHO CARES? IT REALLY ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT, IS IT?
51      TO WILLY, WHO ACCUSED EVERYONE OF  ERASING HIS MESSAGES,  I  KNOW  THAT I  DIDN'T ERASE IT. WHEN I SIGNED ONTO THE
52 SYSTEM, THERE WAS 1 ( YES FOLKS, THAT'S 1, COUNT 'EM, 1 ) LINE LEFT, THAT BEING 629, WITH JUST A CARRIAGE RETURN,
53 AND I USED IT FOR MY MESSAGE.  I ERASED NOTHING, AND PLAN TO ERASE NOTHING.  ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU ERASED MY MESSAGE
54 IN ORDER TO ENTER YOUR DIATRIBE, SO IT  SEEMS THE ONLY ONE GUILTY OF THIS LITTLE "CRIME" IS YOU. THE DUCK FAN RESPONDED
55 THAT HE DIDN'T EITHER, SO OBVIOUSLY IF  YOU DID ENTER A MESSAGE, IT WAS ERASED  BY SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T ENTER ANYTHING.
56 OH, BY THE WAY WILLY, YOU COULD SAVE  A LOT OF ROOM FOR EVERYONE ELSE IF YOU SET THE MARGINS TO 126.  IT'S NOT HARD TO 
57 DO, AND ALLOWS YOU MORE ROOM TO BE MUCH TOO WORDY (LIKE ME!!!).
58      REGARDING THE QUESTION AS TO USAGE OF THE WORD PERFORM.  TODAY,  EVERYONE  CONNECTS THE WORD WITH ACTORS OR MUSIC,
59 WHICH IS ONE DEFINITION, BUT  NOT  THE  ONLY ONE.  PERFORM ALSO MEANS "TO CARRY OUT AN ACTION; EXECUTE;  DO;  TO CARRY 
60 THROUGH TO  COMPLETION  AN  ACTION  OR  UNDERTAKING."  THIS COMES FROM THE LATIN "PAR" (THOROUGHLY) AND "FOURNIR" (TO
61 ACCOMPLISH).  SO IT WAS A CORRECT USAGE, THOUGH APPARENTLY A CONFUSING ONE. I'LL TRY TO BE CLEARER IN THE FUTURE.
62 AH, THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!!  IT'S SO MUCH FUN!!

96 - Doctor - your representation of the 4th dimension is fairly standard; it is -
97 - just an extension of Euclidean geometry. It is satisfactory, however.       -
98 -    If you've every seen Cosmos, the show narrated by Carl Sagan, they have  -
99 - theories on the 4th dimension. For instance, take a straight line. Connect  -
100 - lines to it so that they are all right angles to each other. You get a      -
101 - square.                                                                     -
102 -    Now connect lines to the square so that all of the lines are still at    -
103 - right angles to each other. You get a cube. When you connect MORE lines to  -
104 - the cube, but still keep all of the lines at right angles to each other, you-
105 - get a 4th dimensional figure called a tesseract.                            -
106 -    Moreover, Carl Sagan also pointed out that despite we do not have the    -
107 - sensory apparatus necessary to "see" a 4th dimensional tesseract, we DO have-
108 - the necessary equipment to see its shadow. Much in the same way a 3-dimen-  -
109 - sional cube casts a 2-dimensional shadow, a 4-dimensional tesseract casts   -
110 - a 3-dimensional shadow, which by the way, looks somewhat like a cube within -
111 - a cube connected at the vertices.                                           -
112 -                                                                             -

135 DOC I THINK THAT THE CONCLUSION ABOUT INFINITE SOLUTIONS TO 0/0 CAN BE
136 INFERRED BUT NOT TOO STRONGLY FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE SUPERCONDUCTING LOOP,
137 FOR THESE REASONS: AMPEREAGE IS A MEASURE OF ELECTRONS/SECOND PASSING
138 THROUGH A WIRE. A GIVEN WIRE WILL HAVE A LIMIT ON ITS CAPACITY FOR ELECTRONS.
139 IF THE WHOLE THING HAS A NET CHARGE THERE CAN BE MORE THAN JUST THE NUMBER
140 OF ELECTRONS IN THE WIRE, BUT STILL A FINITE CAPACITY. THEREFORE THE
141 NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS IS WITHIN LIMITS. SECOND, SINCE ELECTRONS ARE DISCRETE
142 UNITS, YOU HAVE AN INTEGER SOLUTION. AN INTEGER SOLUTION WITHIN LIMITS LIKE
143 THAT GIVES YOU A FINITE NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS. 
144 PRINT
145    SINCE THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF SPACETIME ARE THOSE WE ARE ORDINARILY

147 ALL THOSE TIMES IN ONES LIFE ARE NOT NOW IS IRRELEVANT. THE FOURTH

151 ============================
152 My opinion of the 'thinking' on this system would be greatly increased if indeed people would 'think' about their messages.
153 First, to Pioneer:  We are obviously four-dimensional, even though you can't see it.  We exist, we will exist, and we have
154 existed.  The fourth dimension.  We cannot see this fourth dimension because our very thought processes are governed by
155 it.  But surely you could have thought of this yourself?  But no, anyone irritated with the phrase 'think about it' is
156 irritated because he recognizes that it clearly describes his problem:  Lack of thought.
157 	And as for the idea of the 'tesseract', I believe you have used the incorrect word.  Perhaps you meant 
158 hypercube.  
159 	As for the tempest-in-a-teapot over 0/0.  Mathematicians wisely leave this value undefined, why can't you?
160 Anyone who has taken calculus (apparently a small fraction of the users on this system) recognizes that the theory 
161 of limits allows a large (infinite) number of solutions to a fraction of the form X/Y where both X and Y tend to 0.
162 Note that this is for the LIMIT, not the actual value!
163 	As for the feeble attempt to put 0/0 in concrete terms, superconductors are not the way to go.  First, current
164 is limited by magnetic field, not by resistance.  Second, magnetic flux is discrete (some day you may learn what this means).
165 	Finally, as for the discussion of black holes:  I doubt whether anyone who has ever used this system has even one
166 tenth enough mathematics and physics to begin to UNDERSTAND the significance of black holes. (Myself included).  Wild ideas
167 may be entertaining, but they don't enlighten.
168 	I'm always on the lookout for pseudoscientific nonsense, and I've found some blatant examples.  One:  In a non-local 
169 newspaper a few years ago, there was an article concerning the following question:  Would adding salt to water cause it to 
170 boil faster?  Everyone wrote in stating their theories, but the general consensus was that if adding salt to water decreased 
171 its boiling point, that would speed boiling, and slow boiling if adding salt increased the BP.
172 	Well, then the argument changed: What effect on BP did adding salt have?  The answers were roughly mixed 50/50.
173 Each person claimed to know THE TRUTH.  Even many of the people whose answers were correct had terrible reasons.  Fortunately
174 I had almost completed a class on CHEMICAL THERMODYNAMICS, which meant that I not only knew the correct answer, but could
175 calculate the precise amount the BP was changed.  I could also describe WHY the effect happened.  But I chose not to write 
176 in, since it was clear that the truth would not set them free.
177 	By the way, more than one of the people who got the wrong answer claimed to be science teachers for high schools/jr highs. 
178 It just goes to show....
179 	Notice that I haven't given the correct answer.  Anyone know it?

223 - To someone above, Pioneers' word for tesseract was correct. -
224 - A "HYPERCUBE" is not a cube within a cube, but a cube aside -
225 - a cube. This then casts a 3 dimensional shadow much like a  -
226 - tesseract, but is not! A Hypercube is one cube set aside    -
227 - themselves, at 1 cube a distance and all angles are not 90  -
228 - degrees. The term "HYPERCUBE" referrs to the shadow. Oh     -
229 - well....                                                    -

231 - Pioneer... If you think about it for a while, the Doctors'  -
232 - theory (fact?) on the infinite number is correct. For a big -
233 - example, divide the number 0 by 5. You get 0, because 5     -
234 - can't go into 0. Now, divide 5 by 0, and you cant even get  -
235 - 0! This is because 0 has no incremental vaule, therefore,   -
236 - something without a incremental value must be infinite.     -

244 - This WAS an interesting discussion until people started to remark on the    -
245 - lack of other people's education. That took some of the spice out of it.    -
246 -    Master, you are correct - I haven't taken enough math for discussions    -
247 - like these - they just don't teach that stuff in high school. Yet. Mostly,  -
248 - I regurgitate thoughts & ideas and various other theories while adding a    -
249 - few thoughts of my own.                                                     -
250 -    I get most of my interesting information out of Isaac Asimov's Science   -
251 - Fiction Magazine, so pardon me if it's mostly science fiction. I don't know -
252 - too much better.                                                            -
253 -    I thought up something funny some time ago: Assume Time is infinite, i.e.-
254 - it goes on forever and ever. Therefore, there has to be an infinite number  -
255 - of days. If there are an infinite number of days, then it stands to reason  -
256 - that there an infinite number of holidays.                                  -
257 -    Since infinity = infinity and cannot equal any other number, every day   -
258 - should be a holiday. Unfortunately, common sense dictates that every day is -
259 - NOT a holidy. You can find that out by looking at your calendar.            -
260 -    Whether or not we are four-dimensional remains to be seen. We can think  -
261 - back through our lifetime in an instant, or imagine a time in the future,   -
262 - but does that mean we are four-dimensional? (Does that mean that that state -
263 - ment is clear? I don't think it is.)                                        -
264 -    I am relying on my description of a fourth-dimensional being, which,     -
265 - being a guess is necessarily insubstantial.                                 -
266 -    Let's talk about something else since the people who are "interested" in -
267 - this discussion can only voice derogatory comments. How about the new video -
268 - game they are developing somewhere (Calfornia?) which is mind controlled. I -
269 - heard that it works on the principle of the lie detector.                   -
270 -    What kind of reactions would the human body have if I thought: "up",     -
271 - "down", "right", "left", "backward" & "forward" ? ..................Pioneer -

296 TO BATPOOP, MASTER, AND UNSIGNED:
297     First of all, I did not bring up the idea of superconduction.  Leonard
298 brought it up, and the only used Ohm's law and I responded in same.  I know
299 that there is much more than Ohm's law (magnetic flux, etc.) governing the
300 current of a semiconductor.  As for the other problems encountered in using
301 superconduction as an example (integers, etc), the are due to the nature of
302 electrons, not the nature of 0/0.
303     As to my education, I have had math up to calculus, general physics, and 
304 general chemistry.  I'll be a freshman at OSU.

329   Doctor, I'm here, thanks for asking.  But what I really want to do is talk to
330 PAM,, 
331 Thanks for the information on the 1982 
332 Magazine. I'll make every effort to 
333 obtain it. 
334 After working with the Sexual Assault Prevention Unit in Crime Prevention at 
335 PPD, I generally agree with your comment on RAPE//
336 Yes, a high percent of RAPES occur between acquaintances, and yes, it is very 
337 difficult to report a "date RAPE, or even worse, a "husband RAPE".  However we 
338 encourage women who are RAPED, as well as the spouse or loved one to REPORT,
339 mainly because the statistics HAVE PROVEN, (here's one for you,) that the 
340 majority of men who RAPE will repeat the Crime. This will probably cause a stir
341 on this system but that's ok. Again, thanks for the info.

348 - To all, Somewhere I heard that the scientists have discover -
349 - ed a new solar system in the Alpha Centuri system (our twin -
350 - star). Is this true?                                        -
351 -                                                             -
352 -                                     TRON                    -
353 -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
354 Answer: Scientists have discovered that surrounding a particular star, I forgot
355 which, is a significant emission of infrared.  Conclusion?  This must be some form of solid matter.  This may either be solid
356 and formed like a planet, etc, or dust, rocks, boulders, etc.  Scientists had never before actually demonstrated the 
357 of solid matter around a star before. (not surprising, since they're so far away.)
358 	
359 	To those that complain that their education is not the issue:  Yes, it IS the issue.  I reference a recent article
360 in Scientific American (month escapes me, but I'll look it up if necessary) that concerned people's misconceptions of
361 Physics.  We all know that before Newton and his laws, people believed that objects that were thrown were kept moving
362 by the pressure of air behind them, that objects fell at speeds proportional to their weight, etc.   Supposedly, that
363 is all behind us.  But on the contrary, the article described research that indicated that a large percentage of the
364 population (in some cases over 50%) had various misconceptions along the lines of the pre-Newtonian physics.  In fact,
365 even high-school physics students were often mistaken.
366 	A number of the commonly held (and wrong) believes were totally ludicrous, while the rest were merely silly.
367 I won't go into the details, since the article was well-written and quite interesting, but it is clear that many people
368 aren't even qualified to discuss simple non-relativistic physics.  Add to this the fact that relativistic physics is
369 quite non-intuitive and non obvious, and is even obscure to those who've had education in it, any discussion of it
370 on this BBS is futile and hopeless.
371 
372 Sure, you can say that you have a "right" to talk about black holes.  That's true, but you also have a "right" to believe
373 that the moon is made of green cheese, that 144,000 fairies can dance on the head of a pin, and that pigs can fly. 
374 But until you stop displaying your ignorance of simple facts in math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, electronics, and
375 other areas of science, we have a right to consider your opinions worthless.

469 PAM: I would agree with your assesment of the unsigned person. Unfortunatly
470 it appears that your comment has left no impact upon the person. (Would a
471 baseball bat help?) The person spoke of erroronious statements and conclusions,
472 yet the very diatribe that was left was filled with those very things!
473 Ah well, There are those who would be afraid to explore the dark allies
474 and side streets for fear of discovering they might be wrong.
475 Charlotte: I notice that you speak only of female rape, what of male rape?
476 (I can hear it now from certain quarters of the Inn "There is no such thing
477 as male rape!" But indeed, what is rape? It is taking with out permission. 
478 Typically rape is confused with arousal and permission. Sexual arousal is a
479 base emotion, and has little to do with permission. Many women who are raped
480 have been sexually aroused during the act, but that does not mean that the
481 permission is given. The same is true of a man, while it specifically is 
482 required that the man be sexually aroused for the rape to take place, that
483 does not automatically presume permission. Of course this whole concept is
484 buried under the major aspect of rape which is of the female being raped.
485 It is highly uncommon for a male to be raped. In a way perhaps this is some
486 kind of statement on our society? I find the whole thing disgusting myself.
487 It is a shame that a crime such as this exists, and a shame that it will 
488 probabally be here a thousand years from now. (Assuming that we are still
489 here, of which I have my doubts.)

509 While it is apparent that there are those using this BBS who would be
510 likely to take up brain surgery after having a high school class on anatomy,
511  (even TRON inadvertantly proved that zero is infinite) I doubt that animousity
512 toward these persons will in any way disuade them or enhance the board
513 for other users.  The nature of this board provides an opportunity for
514 those who noone would normally listen to, to make their opinions (qualified 
515 or not) known.  BBS's are likely to always be applied differently by 
516 various users:  Information medium, instrument of fantasy, ego-trip, comedy
517 hour, etc.   LET IT BE!
518 Perhaps in the near future BBS's will be more specialized as to the users

520 suggest to those who tend to delve
521 into areas in which they are not familiar, that they merely qualify

531 Some people would argue that homosexuality is harmless to those caught up in it
532 and to American society in general.  Mikey's comment brings up another in the
533 list of harms caused by homosexuality:  male rape is not uncommon in the homo-
534 sexual world and its periphery.  If rape is a manifestation of violence, then
535 homosexual males are supporting the incidence of violence in our society (read

568 TO: ALL    RE: 0
569 Just a thought, particularly to those who have programed in basic or some
570 other high level langauge. Think back on that last time you had a fight
571 with your program when you were writting it. Particularly involving the
572 division by zero that was hapening because you were feeding the equation
573 a zero in one of the variables. Now remeber how ticked off yo were because
574 you had to specifically trap for zero to handle it since the program would
575 blow up everytime it hit that point. Now think upon how many times it 
576 either would not have mattered it the value had been zero, or you really
577 did want it to be zero with a result out of the equation as zero. How many
578 of you out there would much rather have had a zero result rather then 
579 an ERROR stop? This is a quiz, the answers will be seen by all...
580 The idea behind all this, is that while adhering to exact rules of math
581 can be nice in most cases, there are areas that the rules may be more
582 trouble then they are worth particularly if they don't fit the appilcation.
583 (If everybody would rather have a zero result returned, then maybe
584 something is wrong with the rule.) (Now I'm probably in trouble with the
585 mathmaticians here, they tend to get very irrate when someone questions
586 their rules, since it is all they have to work with.)

622 - in the right number and the autopilot follows the radio beam.               -
623 -    In America, most 747s have at least four pilots in the cockpit. All of   -
624 - the pilots have to agree on the course set before the plane can take off. In-
625 - this way, no mistakes are made. In certain foreign airlines, the captain is -
