27    When he did wake up, he found that he didn't want to. The darkness was warm, comforting. And there were no
28 dreams.
29    When he opened his eyes he found himself in a high tech hospital room. He tried to move but nothing worked from the
30 neck down. Then he noticed a faint blue glow around him. A paralyzer. To keep him from moving and reopening any
31 wounds. That was also why he didn't feel any pain. As long as the thing was on, he was stuck there. Probably just as
32 well. He closed his eyes again and sleep took him surprisingly fast.
33    Seconds later (it felt like), he was reawakened by a noise. He opened his eyes and saw a figure in a doctor's long
34 white coat. His back was to James but when he turned around James recognised him immediately. "Oh, boy." he said in a
35 weak, rasping voice, "I knew it. I died and gone to hell."
36    The doctor responded with a sour smile. "And greetings to you, too. Sorry to hear your sense of humor hasn't
37 improved any."
38    "I like my humor the way it is. How's it goin', Putzie."
39    The doctor winced at the hated nickname. "I have a name. I would appreciate you using it."
40    "Excuse me, intern Willerd Putzner."
41    "Doctor Putzner."
42    "Doctor! This place has lowered its standards. Never mind. Where's the Old Man?"
43    "He'll be in later. You're not his patient this time, anyway. You're mine. It took three hours to repair the
44 severed nerves and muscles in your back and most of our available blood supply to keep from losing you while I did it.
45 And then I spent another five hours refixing that mess beneath your jawline. Whoever fixed it the first time did a
46 lousy job."
47    "I was rushed."
48    Doctor Putzie was was more than a little skeptical. "YOU fixed it?!"
49    "Yeah, I'll tell you about it later. The girl I brought in with me. How is she?"
50    "Oh, she's fine. In a lot better shape than you are at the moment. She was suffering from some type of powerful
51 nerve toxin. Fortunately our lab boys figured it out pretty quick and she recovered in about forty eight
52 hours."
53    James tried to turn his head to look around. "Where is she?"
54    "Well, no money, no relatives around here... I put her up at my place."
55    "What!?"
56    "Don't bother to thank me. It was my pleasure. I've been showing her the sights around town. She's a delightful
57 girl and I'm really enjoying getting to... know her."
58    "You son of a-"
59    "I said you didn't have to thank me. The expression on your face is thanks enough. You're getting a little
60 overwrought, and I'd hate to see you undo all my nice work. You better get some more rest."
61    Before he could object, Putzie reached over to a long gray machine and hit a switch. James was unconcious
62 instantly.

79        IT is indeed comforting to be able to once again walk the streets of
80 downtown Portland and seldom see a Prostitute, thanks to the outstanding work
81 of Mayor BUd and Chief Penny.  But now I find I can't venture out my apartment door,
82 without encountering muggers and even murderers...is this such a great improvement for what once was
83 the most livable city?
84 You should try LIVING downtown some lifetime.  Better than an INfocom game.
85        IT is really discomforting to decide which is lesser of two evils:
86              Prostitute
87                 or
88              Subtitute (faggots, as in AIDS)
89 I don't know where in downtown you are referring to but the hookers are there. Muggers? Murderers? Downtown? Not really
90 unless you are the kind of un-street-wise person that looks like you are afraid of something. I lived in downtown for more
91 than 8 years and noone ever mugged me. And I am not a big guy. I just know how to survive on the street. You should learn
92 or else stay OFF the street.

94    There has been a resurgence of violnt crime in the area of Portland bounded
95 roughly by the river, Burnside,21st and PSU in which an average of two viloent
96 crimes are commited each and every nigt.
97 There was also a man stabbed repeatedly near SW14th and Hall last week who
98 lay where he bled to  death for many hurs before anyone even noticed or cared
99 ennough to call the police to report it.
100 Maybe it's nothing where you're from but here it seems things are indeed
101 gettin significantly worse.
102 Read the Oregonian...it's there. Everyday.

126 The statistics prove that Portland is one of the worst per capita crime areas
127 in the COUNTRY. Although perhaps it is only in reported crime because it's
128 hard to imagine it being any more dangerous than New York City, where walking
129 on the street at night feels like a life-threatening adventure.
130 
131 But my feeling is that Bud and Penny (don't their namesjust say it all?) are
132 just too liberal and weak-minded to crack down on the impotant stuff, and
133 the crooks,  who are generally not so liberal, feel inclined to take advantage
134 of the situation. I love women, but to be a woman in charge ofthe police takes
135 someone a lot tougher than some chick named Penny.
136 
137 Portland, after all, one of the worst in the nation? Seems unreal, but it's
138 true. And to the joker who thinks because he's never been mugged that crime
139 is rapant in our city...
140 
141                                                   You're just plain stupid.

173             The  mist  hung  over  the  mountains like a gossamer cover,
174        gripping the trees and the road in its silky embrace. It was just
175        like he  remembered, just  like it  always was, coming though the
176        Cascade Range towards the coast. 
177             'Nothing changes. Even after all  these years  the mountains
178        still look the same.'
179             Ten years  ago, Ben  Clausen chose  the fast life of the big
180        city over rural existence in the  small Oregon coastal village of
181        Cooper  Bay. Now  Ben  had  changed his mind. He was returning to
182        the land of his birth. He wanted to go home.
183             Ten years. The thought would not leave  his mind. 'I've been
184        gone  so  long,  shat  will  I  find there now? Hostility or open
185        arms? Can things ever be the same again?'
186             Through the help of a realtor  friend in  New York,  Ben had
187        put the  down payment  on a  small cottage with a beautiful ocean
188        front vista. At least that's what the  blurb in  the listing book
189        had  said. It  was  expensive,  but  money was the least of Ben's
190        problems.
191             The flight  from Kennedy  in New  York to  Portland had been
192        uneventful. Ben had  chosen to  drive the  remaining miles to the
193     coast in a rented car. He thought  the  drive  would  give  him a
194     final chance  to prepare  himself mentally for what he would find
195    in Cooper Bay.
196            The drive took on  second
197 <line noise>
198             The drive took on  secondary consideration  as Ben continued
199        to ponder  his decision  to move. The  beat of  the wipers taking
200        away the Cascade mist provided the appropriate accompaniment.
201             'My move was  so  sudden,  I  know  it  stunned  most  of my
202        friends. They  just   couldn't  understand  what  I  was  feeling
203        inside. I was unable to tell  them  myself. The  typical  lack of
204        communication strikes again. I just had to get away. Ten years of
205        the hustle and bustle  and clawing  towards the  top has  worn me
206        out. I am  sick of stepping over others for a chance at the brass
207        ring.'
208             Ben left  many friends  behind. He also  left many opportun-
209        ities back  on 5th Avenue, 3000 miles and a world away from where
210        he was heading now.
211             'Damn!' Ben had done a  great deal  of soul  searching these
212        last  few  days,  but  peace  seemed  as elusive as ever. 'I have
213        forsaken everything I worked  so hard  for. I am  heading into an
214        unknown, a  place that  has probably changed as much as I have in
215        the decade since I  left. Have I  made the  right decision? Can I
216        ever  return  to  the  way  things  were before? What of my grand
217        experiment; the local high school wonderkid  goes away  to school
218        in New York, and comes back ten years later with his tail between
219        his legs.'
220             Ben had been a  specially  gifted  student,  a  quality that
221        didn't  go  unnoticed  thanks  to  the  coverage  his  scholastic
222        achievements earned  him  in  Oregon  newspapers. He  won  a full
223        scholarship  to  New  York  University. Ben continued his stellar
224        educational performance while majoring in Business communications
225        and advertising. The  big Pinkton and Rich ad agency snatched him
226        up upon graduation, and for the past six years he had been one of
227        the leading commercial writers in New York.
228             Ben had  started to  feel 4he  burnout that  so often accom-
229        panied the business. He  realized  he  needed  a  change  of pace
230        from  the  hurried,  never  stop  life style he had formed around
231        him. The idea of starting  up a  small one-man  operation back in
232        Cooper Bay had come to him one night after an especially long day
233        of meetings with prospective clients. Ben put  in his  two week's
234        notice soon  after. Despite the protests of Pinkton and Rich, Ben
235        was soon on his way west, wondering what the future held for him.
236             'My ideas are sound,' he thought, rounding one  corner after
237        another in  the long  drive through the mountains. 'I know I have
238        the skills to help the local businesses all  around the area. But
239        will they  accept me? I  know I  am an outsider even though I was
240        born there. What will they think of the city slicker come back.'
241             Ben's train of thought was  interrupted  by  a  bright light
242        coming through the windshield. The fog had broken and the sun was
243        out. Ben realized he was  through  the  mountains  and descending
244        into the coastal lowlands. So  affected by  the wonderful tableau
245        that  presented  itself  before  him,  Ben  pulled  his  car over
246        and stopped.
247             A slight  haze partially  hid the  bay, but he could see the
248        town, his town, spread out before him like a miniature  city in a
249        picture postcard.
250             'It hasn't changed a bit,' Ben mused. 'After all these years
251        it looks exactly  like  I  remember  it. The  same  buildings and
252        offices dot  the same streets I walked so long ago. Everything is
253        here just like I left it.'
254             A shiver of  excitement  and  anticipation  ran  through Ben
255        Clausen. Overlooking  the  town  from  the  low  hills above, Ben
256        realized something very important.
257             'I have come back to the place I  belong. I will  make a new
258        life for  myself in  Cooper Bay. I have been gone a long time and
259        now I have a lot of catching up to do. I am not sorry for leaving
260        New York anymore. This is it. I know I made the right decision. I
261        can come home again.'

269      "Zeb!" Trainor awoke with a start. His eyes were wide and the pupils
270 danced crazily, examining every corner of the room. Finally his eyes fell on
271 the lady now know as Aedem. She returned Trainor's gaze with a smile.
272      "Cragmore, Emu, Bard, get in here, help me up." Trainor called for his
273 companions, who hurried into the room and to his side moments after he spoke.
274      "Are you...OK now Trainor?" Bard asked quietly. "You had us worried there
275 for awhile."
276      "We felt obligated to help you out, I hope you understand." Cragmore con-
277 tinued.
278      "Did you see our marks?" finished Emu.
279      "My friends, your caring efforts are greatly appreciated. I was overcome
280 with insanity, you know the reasons why. I understand now that I was wrong in
281 my feelings. Aedem and I have resolved our conflict. I am content with the
282 situation. I thank you again my friends."
283      Aedem approached the bed where Trainor lay. "I say we leave this place,
284 now. The Creature from Zeb is no longer. Our path is free and clear." The
285 woman once known as zeb spoke with calm authority.
286      Emu looked at Trair. "We can leave, return to the Inn. Trainor, nothing
287 remains to be done here, right?"
288      "Yes Emu, please take care of it. Bard, could you go with him and help
289 with the preparations. Cragmore, see to Piper and Lady Tayre, if you will. I
290 want to speak to Aedem for a moment, then I'll join you."
291      "Sure Trainor. It is good to have you back."
292      "It is good to be back Cragmore."
293      Cragmore left and Trainor turned to Aedem. "We have been through a great
294 deal. Our minds have touched and I think I understand what must happen now. As
295 you saw my inner-most feelings, I saw yours. I know you must return to your
296 place in the universe. I know that we must not meet again. I know your
297 journey back is just beginning, while ours is almost over. What will you do?"
298      "Yes you do know my thoughts as I know yours. You will return shortly to
299 the Inn, and these adventurers will scatter to the winds. I know you will
300 scatter the farthest, in search of a new home. I know your search will not be
301 easy, but you will find what you are looking for. I know that once I leave
302 I must not return. I will go with you to the Inn, and from there I will depart.
303 The magic is strong at the Inn, my heart tells me so. I am confident that I
304 can make it back to my origin from there."
305      "The Inn is strong. I felt that strength when I first arrived in my Pell-
306 mell. I too will set forth from there. Goodbyes are best said now, the trip
307 to the Inn will be short."
308      "Trainor, goodbyes are best now. As distance separates us our souls will
309 mingle in the stars. Goodbye."
310      A moment later she was gone. Trainor knew he would not see her again.
311 She would quickly exit the Pell-mell upon its arrival at the Inn. He tried to
312 dismiss the feelings he felt creeping up already.
313  
314      "Cragmore? Where are you? I am ready to help you with the others!"

323 write. Well, you are about to learn. You see, you have insulted me from the very day I came back to get McKane, and 
324 now, you are part of all this. You better be very very careful, because I'm looking for you, and sooner or later I'll
325 find you. And then what will you do? WHAT WILL YOU DO? Delta Five.
326 Wassir: It's your move.

328 it is a marker and has no connection with any text above it...

334 pursue this quest with the same ferocity?

351 Jane: If I may critique your first entry -- There were a lot of redundancies
352 dragging the story out.  It appeared to me that you were trying to set the
353 mood of the character, but (at least for me), it wasn't quite right.  Keep

358 AM Goer: Why don't you try writing something yourself instead of sniveling
359 about what others write. This BBS is patronized by a handful of people with
360 some good writing ability, and a horde of small minded creeps who have 
361 nothing better to do than unwittingly express their jealousy by trying to put
362 down others. You can't beat us, and you can't hurt us with your metaphorical
363 sticks and stones, so why don't you join us? If there were more attempts at writing something other than criticism this BBS
364 would be a more pleasant place for everyone. 
365 .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
366 Jane: another comment might be to shorten your entries.  Save some of the
367   story for later, instead of one long block.  Also, don't be discouraged
368   by any name callers or super-critics that might try throwing a bone
369   your way.

373 Jane Smith: No one escapes my comments here, especially new folks. The writing
374 is fine, but your uploads make any thoughts of whether it's good or not moot.
375 Too many spaces, and much too long an entry. I think you'll find Backwater
376 readers much more interested in short, to-the-point entries...
377 
378 Delta V: After rereading (actually as soon as I hung up) my entry I realized
379 that it was much too harsh a criticsm, and I apologize, because you're giving
380 it a good effort and you're far more interesting than many. Just looks like
381 you rush it once in a while. HOWEVER, I'd love to take you on... I lurk in the
382 shadows and assume many identities, so
383 you may not always know whether you got the right target!
384 
385 Thank goodness the Emu Bard etc. people are scattering to the winds, that
386 piece of good writing but uninteresting story was bogged down deeper than the
387 dark woods of Ephengel.
388 
389 As an occasional writer, I have found it sometimes frustrating to put in entries
390 and have no comments back, positive or otherwise. Therefore I decided to name
391 myself the Self-Styled Critic in an  effort to give the good writers of this
392 board an idea of at least one person's opinion. I shall always try and be
393 constructive and positive, but carefully worded negativisms are sometimes 
394 necessary to improve one's writing. If someone doesn't like it, tough, because
395 it's a free forum. And they can criticize my criticisms if they want...
396 I just think it's a service that needs doing occasionally, and any good writer
397 should always be anxious for feedback, good or bad. I shall, however, as mentioned, try and remain responsible and
398 upbeat.

413 up at about 2 AM the day of a bitch of a final exam. If I took more time, perhaps
414 It might have been different, but whatever-what I write is what I write. Since you

437   The piper sat alone at a scarred table, a wounded beast seeking solace
438 in the shadows.  Next to him was a tarred leather container that had 
439 recently contained a rather large quantity of the Inn's best ale.
440 Within, he contained several measures of that ale, and an inconsolable
441 grief.  The effect of the ale did little to blunt the edge of the pain
442 although he sought the dregs of the container for an anodyne.
443   Heedless of those around him, he pillowed his face on his bandaged arm,
444 the pain of the disturbed wound a counterpoint to the stabbing pain in
445 his heart.  As the tears soaked his neatly bandaged arm, his shoulders

462 Franklin Pervis took a sip of the hot black coffee and stared at the CRT term-
463 inal in front of him. He pondered his cup for a moment- he had gotten for 
464 (it for) Christmas a few years back from a favored niece of his- and now it was worn and colored light brown around the
465 edges. Just like an old pipe, it had reached the point of perfected usage, where every sip of the warm stuff tasted like
466 ambrosia.
467 But this morning was slightly different, even with the down-home feeling of his coffee cup, and the familiar surround-
468 ings of his workplace. He worked at "The
469 Daily Ditto," a near-tabloid newspaper which worked very hard to expose whatever injustice might come its way. As one
470 of the paper's top reporters, he had uncovered more than one scandal in his lifetime. But today, his fingers tried to 
471 disassociate themselves from his brain. Instinctively, they wanted to remain attached to the body they had come to so 
472 dearly love and rely on.
473 
474 
475 But Franklin Pervis' mind forced his fingers to work, and slowly but with a sureness of will that belied his inner
476 turmoil, he started pecking at the keys before him.

478     DO KILLERS LURK IN OUR CITY?
479 By Franklin Pervis
480 
481 Dec. 11, 1985. This article is written with not just a small amount of trepidation. For you see, it may be a matter of
482 life and death for this writer. I am, in effect, risking my life to expose this latest cancer in our society. Indeed,
483 my life has already been threatened, by a man who claims to respect me, but feels no qualms about ending my life, simply
484 because I called a shortcoming in his personality to his attention.
485 
486 The man? He goes by the name of Delta V. His purpose? Apparently, to kill, extort, and track down any number of enemies
487 with the sole purpose of eliminating their lives.
488 
489 I must, in the interest of society, find out more of this man. I do not know his real name, I do not know where he
490 lives. Surely he knows, or will know, much about me. But he is a killer, and he must be stopped. Public outcry may be 
491 the only way. Delta V is a menace to our way of life, and it is my duty as a
492 citizen of this nation to lead the charge against him."
493 
494 Pervis leaned back against his chair, contemplating the flickering white letters against the bland green screen. He
495 fondled his coffee cup, and took a quiet sip. He thought of Delta V, and
496 wondered when, and if, he might meet the man face to face. His hands shook slightly as he patted his overcoat, whic
497 was sitting atop the back of his chair. Yes, that small can of mace was still there.
498 
499 Pervis wiped his furrowed brow, and continued writing...

528 Scotland Yard, London - Internal memo:
529 
530 	It has come to the attention of the intelligence team that the
531 fugitive known as "Delta V" is on the loose in Switzerland. The trail
532 of carnage this man has left speaks for itself. The I.T. report requests
533 appropriate actions be taken, ie send out agents just as mean and tough
534 and loathsome as Delta V claims himself to be. If these pursuit agents
535 can effect a capture, the I.T. report recommends return of Delta V to
536 the Dublin office for intense interrogation. If Delta V refuses to be
537 taken alive, facilitate his wishes and eliminate him.
538 	Intelligence also recommends contacting NET for further
539 assistance in this operation. They have dealt with the Delta series of
540 agents before and are familiar with their operations techniques.
541 	Finally, funds have been appropriated for the hire of an outside
542 consultant, a Mr. Robert Ludlum. Mr. Ludlum has also had some experience
543 with omnipotent agents and will serve as a great aid in the capture or
544 elimination of Delta V.

607 left in the sand now!  If I didn't already know what was there I'd be lost.
608 How about you?  Don't you think it's getting a little dark out here?" asked
609 the pixie that had been my companion for the evening.
610       "Oh," I commented regretfully.  "You are quite right.  We have been
611 talking and drawing, and talking some more for a very long time."  I began
612 to stand to work off the sleep that had seeped into my kneeling legs.  "I
613 hope that I haven't kept you from anything you might have better spent your
614 time on.  I appologize if I have..."
615       "No, oh no no no!  It was welcome company.  It seems the band of Inn-
616 dwellers I was trying to reach left just as I was nearing the bend in the
617 road.  Why, if you hadn't come out of the Inn when you did, I would pro-
618 bably have been faced with a long return journey home."  The tiny pixie did
619 not seem to have been affected by the duration of the chat, she just
620 bounced up from her place on the ground and started off towards the Inn.
621       "Where are you off to now?" I asked as she made no immediate mention
622 of going anywhere.
623       "To the Inn, silly!  That was where I was going in the first place.
624 And that is where you came from.  If we both go, at least one of us shall
625 know what it's like inside."  The spring in her step gave me motivation.
626 "Could you tell me of the Inn?
627       "Why should I tell you now when you could wait to see for yourself?"
628 The spring in our steps returned as we headed up that hill to the Inn.
