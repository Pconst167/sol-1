44 Voyeur: yes, I do have a few word processors for the 64... since I plan to bring all my disks anyway it is sure to 
45 be in there somewhere.
46 Tammy: My spells are encoded in a polyalphabetic manner, look in a book on cryptology if you need more explanation.

55 Hi all,
56 	Tuck here.  Well, all I see is gossip.  No great creative stories, aww.
57 Anyway...
58 Film Critic:  What about "The Wall"?  I really think that has to be the
59 best movie I have seen.  Lots of subjective meaning, very little meaningless
60 dialogand some good music.  It really sinks into some real problems, ones
61 that other films wouldn't touch.
62 	Does anybody out there read H.P. Lovecraft?  Great horror stories.
63 A little more in detail and meaning than Deities & Demigods.  Read some!

79 THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST SUBTLE AND SCARY ONE, OR PERHAPS "THE SHADOW OUT OF TIME", "SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH"," THE

89 I finished at about 2 am. ... Picture it: I'm all alone in  a BIG OLD (& noisy)

97 auction, but it won't fit on the BUS.

100 The Innkeeper was left sitting by the door to the Inn. He held 
101 one of Pam's shoes in his hand. Apparently she had slipped away 
102 at last, but left the Innkeeper holding her shoe. "Well" thought 
103 the Innkeeper, "I guess she'll have to come back sometime to get 
104 her shoe at least." <long pause> "I wonder why anyone would ever 
105 want to actually drink champane out of one of these? You could 
106 get athlete's tongue or something. Yuck! Besides, it tastes 
107 lousy." Getting up and moving back behind the bar, the Innkeeper 
108 stowed the shoe in a handy cubbyhole under the bar, and went 
109 back to work serving customers and cleaning tables.
110 ################### The Innkeeper ##########################
111                         What's Good for the Goose...
112                                 part 2
113 
114         "Right out of an 'I Dream of Genie' rerun", I said to myself, still
115 naturally a bit stunned by the sequence of events that had befallen me.
116         "Who dare disturb my three thousand year sleep?!?", demanded a voice,
117 that seemed, incredibly enough, to come from inside of my own head.
118         "Geeze", I thought, "What was in those mushrooms I had for lunch?"
119         "Foolish mortal. Never can you accept things the way they are. Always
120 you question your own existence, as well as the existence of everything else.
121 Never can you take for granted what your senses tell you!", the voice seemed
122 to scream, racking my head with its anger.
123         "Don't tell me...You...You're the genie from the bottle!", I almost
124 laughed at myself for being so foolish. But I must admit, it was the best
125 description for the situation I could think of at the time.
126         "Ahhh...You taunt me mortal! Next you will ask for me to grant you
127 three wishes, in payment for releasing me."
128         "Well...I must admit...everything else seems to be falling in place.
129 A mysterious bottle, half buried in sand, I give it a rub and open its top,
130 you appear, floating about like something out of a B-grade Arabian adventure
131 flick. What am I supposed to think?"
132         "Perhaps you have taken these 'flicks' as you call them to heart, but
133 not I. You have disturbed my peaceful sleep. I did not ask you to break into
134 my home, and commit sacrilege against my domain, and for that, it is I who
135 will demand the three wishes!"
136         This last line confused me. I wasn't sure if this still wasn't just
137 some drug induced hallucination. But heck, I might as well play along. What
138 can happen anyway, if it's only my mind playing tricks with me?
139         "OK 'genie'. What would you like me to do? What is your first wish, oh
140 master?" I couldn't hide the smirk on my face, and my tone betrayed my 
141 amusement with this little reversal of roles.
142         "First, you will cease smiling like some ignorant fool! I hate nothing
143 worse than an insolent and disrespectful slave!"
144         "As you command, oh 'genie'", I said, wiping the smile from my face,
145 and to myself, "Slave eh?" Again out loud, "How can you understand what I
146 am saying, yet speak directly to my mind?"
147         "Enough questions!!!", the genie roared. "Suffice it to say I can
148 not only place my thoughts in your puny mind, but I can see what your thoughts
149 are too. My second command will be a bit more difficult for your feeble
150 self to handle. You are to take this cloth," and with a small puff of smoke,
151 a piece of silk, finer than any I had ever seen, appeared next to me, "and
152 clean the bottle. Clean it from top to bottom. Clean it with a vigor. Clean
153 it like your life depended on it, because mortal fool, it does!"
154         The threat rang in my ears, and my head spun with disbelief, but
155 I obeyed my new 'master'. I got up from the sand, and slowly, very slowly,
156 reached for the bottle, careful not to touch the wisp of smoke that originated
157 within. I rubbed and rubbed. It took several minutes, but when I was
158 finished, the bottle glistened with a sheen of unbelievable luster.
159         "That will be passable. And now for my final wish. You will return
160 my bottle to the sea. The tide here is going out. You will throw the bottle
161 with all your strength. I want never to return to these forsaken shores.
162 Quickly now. Hold out your hand."
163         I obliged, and for a second time, a puff of smoke revealed something
164 new. This time, a cork stopper. Certainly not the original stopper I
165 removed; too clean; not worn around its circumference. What next?

168 MIlch: I assume you don't need a ride at all then? I will have all of your magazines.
169 Leonard: If I don't need to give Milch a ride, than I *guess* I can give you a ride. What exactly are we talking
170    about not fitting on the bus? Bring along your Delphi download. I haven't xferred the archive stuff yet since the

202 The Wall, an interesting movie, considering its source. Who on earth do you
203 thing directed the film? An English director of course. While I would certainly
204 not go around touting The Wall as the best movie ever made, I would go for one
205 of the MOST interesting movies ever made, conceived from a Rock and Roll Album.
206 My point about movies made in the USA, is that for the most part, the human
207 element has been discarded for the excitement of hardware. Audiences crave
208 excitement, violence, blood and guts; not relationships, sacrafice, emotion,
209 and convern. Why is 'The Exterminator' the most popular movie in America
210 right now? For the simple reason that American movie goers want this kind of
211 action packed, forget reality, I wanna see some blood movie. If movies are the
212 great escape, what are we escaping too? What kind of morals are we teaching
213 the young, if all they can see is trash like that? There is a time and place
214 for everything, but moderation should be the overriding factor. Perhaps we
215 didn't learn from the Romans after all...

227 L'homme and all; Just got back from work, it is now 11:46, the bus I should have taken from Estacada left about 24 
228 minutes ago.  I shall catch the 1:46 bus and be there by 3.  Sorry, but I'll be at the PC&S.  Further note: My SAT 
229 scores are in.... 660 verbal, 700 math.
230 +++++++++++++
231 We appeared to be quite near the citidel now.  It was a glistening tower of some odd material the like of which I had
232 never seen.  The cystal forest about us thinned as we approached it.  My ears were still ringing with the noise of 
233 those horrid azure creatures, though they were far behind us.  Strange, I thought I saw the large Demon over there 
234 also... he seems to be gone now.  Exceedingly odd.  "Whooosh, Whooosh."  All right, now what was it?  That certainly 
235 was a strange sound to be coming from a citidel.  #All right if we rest outside for a bit?#  Assent from everyone.  
236 They had run around for quite some time.  I felt we deserved a rest.
237 +++++++++++++++++++
238 ??????????????????? (double entry again)
239 The Doctor found himself face down on the floor after a rather bumpy landing.  "Master.  Outside sensors indicate a
240 large energy source bearing 317.4 degrees, distance 4 meters."  K-9 was still working, as usual.
241 "Right, K-9.  Er.. what is it?", the Doctor asked while searching his scarf for his Sonic screwdriver.
242 "A large structure of about 200 meters, Master.  It appears to be the source of the energy field that brought us here."
243 "Ah, good.  At least it wasn't Milchar.  I'll still get those 3x5 cards, though.  Tell me, where are we?"
244 "Co-ordinates undefined.  Position sensors inoperable."
245 "Good, wouldn't want to go into an adventure knowing where we are, would we?  That'd spoil all the fun."  Despite the
246 Doctor's words, he was worried.  "Let's have a look around, shall we?"
247 Outdoors, the air was fresh and alive.  The surrounding territory was rather bleak, a forest of crystalline structures
248 about 5-10 meters tall.  The only really interesting feature of the entire landscape was the tremendously large tower
249 to his left.  It streched up, on and on, with no apparent opening in its surface.  "Oh, lovely.  Sucked here by that
250 thing and no way to get in.  That's just fine and dandy.  Hello.  What's that?"
251 Abruptly, off to his left again, some figures emerged from the tangle of crystal behind them.  Some of the faces looked
252 familiar somehow to him.  He waited, and was rewarded by recogition of the group.  Piper, Leonard, an elderly woman, 
253 Bard, Poet, L'homme, and... Milchar.  "Aha, I knew he was in on this somehow."

307 To person above complaining about deleted messages:
308 Please read the opening message on the disk. Particularly note
309 the "I retain the right to delete messages I may find offensive."
310 Also note that it states right out that this is a private 
311 system. I pay for the phone line and the electricity, I also 
312 provide the equipment it runs on. As such, I have the right to
313 control the system. I am very open about most things, but I
314 am not in regard to messages intended to hurt other people,
315 those intent on vandlism, or that some may find offensive.
316 My views may seem to be a bit puritanical, but I have to draw
317 a line someplace, and look what happened when it was left there 
318 for awhile, far more offensive messages were left. This is why 
319 I run a strict system in that regard.

330 So, you didn't like the words for that age old song.  I was just trying
331 to inform the public of a unanswered question.  It may be offencive but
332 at least it was a little cute, just a little.  
333 
334 I don't think that the sysop is the only one that is deleting messages.
335 There is probably another user that may find everything offencive so he
336 takes it to himself to be the sole evenger of the "good faith" and delete
337 the messages before the children see them.  Let the sysop judge what is
338 good for the board or bad for it, it is his system so he makes the rules.

353 Hi all,
354 	Tuck here.  The senses are absolute.  If you perceive a red apple on
355 a tree, then there is a red apple on the tree.  For, if we could not trust
356 out preceptions, then where would we be.  We could trust nothing, nothing
357 could be proven or disproven.  We base our judgements on preceptions,
358 they need to be accurate.  (The only real questions is wether or not we
359 really preceive the apple on the tree.)
360 	Goodbye, whoever.  I'm sorry to see anyone go.  We can all contibute
361 something.
362 	Uncle ^SKIP:  Ease off on Wren.  "Forgive your enimies, it'll
363 really throw them for a loop."  I hope it'll work.
364 	Milchar (or any of the "regulars"):  What is PorSFic?  Give us
365 some information.  I'd like to come.
366 	Unbeliever & Apprentice:  I think the best story is "The Statement of
367 Randolph Carter."  "Dreamquest of Unknown Kadath" is good if you can
368 get through it.
369 	Deleted person:  Remember, Cisop Mikey is a dictator, and dictators
370 can do what ever they want.  If you want to be in control, get your own
371 board.  Or, try some humor that's acceptable (to Mikey anyway)  Frankly,
372 I would have liked to see some of your stuff, and judge for myself.
373 	"That silly elf song is driving me crazy!"

388 Kathy: what you missed was an extremely unmotivated group of people.
389 If you had made it, you would either has inspired us, or ended up as
390 dull as us.  It's probably just as well you missed it (else we'd probably
391 not see you again, like so many others who show up once).
392 L'homme: I finally got around to converting my archives from single-sided
393 to double sided.  That left me with 22 disks still in use, with 26 freed up.
394 I was originally going to do all the processing while doing the xfer,
395 but I decided that at the rate it was going, I might as well do 'em as I
396 got in the mood.  By the way - when can I expect those two disks to be ready?
397 I'm kinda anxious to take a look at them. (maybe you can drop them off at
398 the Fish & Wildlife and they can be brought home from there... or on second
399 thought, that may not be such a good idea).
400 Leonard: while putting the archive files on double sided, I also organized
401 them.  You were right - they were really a mess.  The first year especially -
402 I think that was when L'homme was having his original problems with the xfer,
403 until he got the system streamlined.
404 I found a note on one of my disks - it listed Dec0582, Dec2282, and that infamous
405 May2083.  Are those files that were not available in the first group, but are
406 now ready? (along with all the subsequent disks?)  If so, I didn't leave room
407 for them.  Of course.

411 Siskel and Ebert return (sp?) a.k.a. 'a film fan' and Sondargaard
412 Fan: Being in the movie business, I'd like to clarify a few points for you.
413     1) Odd as it may seem, Principal Shooting for 'The WALL' had begun before
414        the album was even released- although I don't know why a couple of the 
415        songs were deleted from the album's first pressing....
416        The album paved the way for the coming film.  (hush-hush)
417     2) As someone else so ungraciously put it: The movie you were thinking
418        about was 'The Terminator' starring Arnold S., and not 'EXTerminator'
419        starring- who cares; by the way, it's on the Top Ten Grossing Films
420        (money-making, not grossing-out with a spoon) list for the week,
421        not the number one film though.
422       I feel that you are a bit more sophisticated in the way you state your
423      opinions, and that I manage, but are we arguing for arguments sake, or
424      are we as close as we can get to BBS version of those two from Chicago?
425       Until we type again... <beep,beep>
426 [[[ NOW can we leave the real world, and return to our INN? ]]]

430      Ontho started buzzing frantically "dezzzaatzz, tezzztazzde, (ect)" Leo
431 looked up from her resting postion to see what the action was all about.
432 A large flash of light could be seen down on the surface. "oh goody gumdrops"
433 "some action at last!!!" Leo leaped to her feet and was down on her butt 
434 just as fast .. ( forgetting about the ice ). Over comming her akwardness
435 she got up again.   Ontho chuckled. She spotted the getaway vehicle first
436 and pointed it out to Ontho, who matched the vehicles course and speed.
437      The vehicle was traveling fast down on the tundra and the navigator
438 seemed to know the route well, they lost sight of the vehicle more than
439 once as it veered around cornices and pits.  And then it went straight
440 up 50 yards and then straight down into the earth.  They flew over where
441 the vehicle vanished and saw a large opening. "In we go!!" Leo shouted to
442 Ontho who had already taken that intiative. Leo held the trident high and
443 it started to glow.  
444      The plunged into the abbess and the howling of the wind stopped, down 
445 and down into the hole. The only light being cast from the trident. Ontho
446 slowwed the disk, so they wouldn't crash into anything unexpectedly. A strange
447 glow could be seen in the distance.  Ontho slowed even further and they
448 "crawled" up to the cavern. 
449      It opened up into a huge underground city of sorts.  With modern
450 buildings secured to the floors and ceiling of the cave with steel fittings.
451 Moving sidewalks were everywhere. And all sorts of alien life was mulling
452 about. Several Inmo's included.  Human children were everywhere, all wearing
453 the mind control headgear.  
454      Our travelers were moving about unnoticed thanks to the invisablity
455 shield and were learned quite abit. Leo's hand was flying over the pages
456 in her journal. writing down as much as she could so her reports would
457 be accurate. Ontho was usig the disks sensory devices to located energy
458 sources, and found something quite interresting. A direct wave comming from
459 and monument straight ahead.

463 The time has come for the Federal government to issue each citizen a
464 VCR and a cable hookup.  We already have the "bread", now we need the 
465 circuses.  If it's true that the average American watches 6(SIX!) hours of TV
466 a day, then why not let them watch 16?  They won't be missed...  Let the rest
467 of us continue civilization's progress, and let the other members of the Homo
468 Sapiens family (isn't Homo Sapiens Televionus an oxymoron?) branch off to their
469 (presumably) inevitable extinction.  Give them continual television, and they
470 will fail to procreate.  Will society really miss Fundamentalism, Hustler, Neo-
471 Nazis, etc.?

477 Great idea.

480 My subtle mis-typing of the movie "The Terminator" is of course taken wrong by
481 those who disagree. Perhaps some don't realize a very common form of put-down
482 is to call something or someone incorrectly. "That's RockFORD, not RockFISH,
483 if you will."
484 My sources concerning the Wall seem to say different. Consider the film came
485 out over a year after the album was released (what kind of market setup is
486 that?) No one is going to release a movie based on an album that fails 
487 miserably. There is no certainty in the record business, even for a group with
488 the stature of Pink Floyd. Distributers are going to wait until the basis of
489 the movie (the album) is firmly situated in the market place. Considering the
490 album was a huge sucess, won a grammy, and was widely acclaimed as one of the
491 greatest R&R works of all time, the movie was of course a natural.
492 'The Wall' was not an overwhelming commercial success, being resigned to smaller
493 theaters and cult status, which seem unfortunately to depend on lack of
494 success, but it is still a film that coupled with the album soundtrack,
495 accuratly depicted the group's outlook on society. Commercial success not-
496 withstanding, it was a moral success in the highest degree. For that, the
497 group and the makers of the film are to be commended for ignoring money as
498 the over-riding factor, and sticking with their original ideas.

502 Cistern/Cistop Mikey:  I resent the innuendo that I have not the capacity or
503 the wit to understand the rules governing your system.  I have read the 
504 beginning the disk, and furthermore, I understand it.  However, you sir, seem
505 not to understand what it says.  The reason I 'spoke' to Phantom Glitch was
506 because he is not the Sysop. The Welcome message clearly states "...As the
507 system is privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages
508 which I may find offensive."  Unless you have given out the right of 
509 censorship to the users, I felt he had oversteped his 'rights' of use on this
510 BBS. 
511    If "Phantom Glitch" is one of your alternate personalities, please accept
512 my apologies.  If not, I stand on my beliefs.

515    Perhaps the opening message should be reformatted to take the edge off.  As
516 it stands, I am afraid it is a little insulting to those who were innocently
517 leaving entries without malice, or even knowledge that what they were doing
518 was wrong.  Simply stating a few or only one, simple guidelines should make it
519 all just a bit nicer.  As for what the guidelines should be; I have given no
520 thought to this.  But with the style of this System; I'm sure one will be soon
521 found.  If there is a recognized need.  And I'm not sure about the need, or
522 lack thereof.
523 
524 For the one who left forever; Why do you leave?  I see nothing wrong with your
525 departing entry, perhaps a little sorrowfull, but my last BackWater message
526 would be too.  My memory fails me as to who is so unpopular to warrant your
527 apparent banishment, and even if it is debatable (You unpopularity) then why
528 not make a new start?  Even for all the people who make first impression
529 judgements that they take to their graves, pretty much everyone here is truly
530 kind, and gracious.  I don't know why you have chosen to leave, nor why you
531 attribute unpopularity as a reason; but please come back, please?
