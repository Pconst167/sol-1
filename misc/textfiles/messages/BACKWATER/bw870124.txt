22 Friar: I suspect that a 6 year single term would only make the situation
23 worse. A big problem now is that cme the second term the president really
24 has no need to do things the way the majority of the people want him too.
25 He can't get re-elected, and there is no place else to go after being
26 the president that is of any importance. As a result, there is no reason
27 for them to do what the people want. At least with a four year term there
28 is some degree of acountability required if they expect to get reelected.
29 I think that the real problem is that they just slack off after the 2nd
30 election because they don't have to worry about getting re-elected, and
31 so don't care if they get in trouble. There is always the talk that he 
32 has to do good so that the party will look good and win more seats in the
33 next election, but that is the party promoters speaking and not the
34 individual. Maybe what we really need is not a 6 year term, but a 2 year
35 re-election term. Now some say that a 2 year term would be disruptive,
36 That the president couldn't get anything done since he would have to
37 always keep his nose clean for the upcoming election, but that is the
38 idea behind it. As for it not giving the president enough time to get
39 anyting done, I disagree with that, since if he was kicked out after
40 only two years, it means that the people didn't want hom doing what he
41 was doing anyway. So it gives them an oportunity to get rid of him before
42 he does too much damage. If he was re-elected though, then nothing is
43 disrupted since he remains in office and can continue with what he was
44 doing. The other thing I would like to see is an upper age limit.
45 Let's say around 70. There are several problems with someone over 75
46 being in that position. The first is that it is very demanding and 
47 stressful. Though that isn't a reason to disallow the person of itself,
48 but the other is that the persons views about the world and the way 
49 things should be is different than the majority of those who he is
50 supposed to be representing. This creates conflicts. With the threat
51 of re-election hanging infront of them, that surpresses the urge to
52 ignore what the general populance wants and do what he wants. But 
53 come that final term, he is old, doesn't care what others think, so
54 he does what he wants and to hell with the people he is supposedly
55 running the country for.

64            The time has certainly come where the re-election process needs
65 revamping.  I agree, electing a U.S. President today is a waste of precious
66 time and $.  Changing the term of office will not change this.

69 the unrestricted use of money, in support of "their" candidate, they will!

83 year term without the possibility of re-election would alleviate the

100 Probably *THE* major problem with the re-election process is the process itself.
101 The fact that every four years we have to stop, change gears, try to do two
102 things at once and expect some measure of success is more than the people can
103 be expected to endure.  Even in high school we were aware that the best form
104 of government is a "benevolent dictatorship."  The trick here is to keep it 
105 benevolent.  Over the years a variety of methods have been suggested, but to 
106 date the only way that might keep a ruler honest is the threat of revolution.
107 Any country that truly fears revolution takes drastic steps to disarm the 
108 populace (the examples are too numerous to bother listing.)  Perhaps our
109 president should be elected for life, as is the pope, but the general public
110 al of arms.  Admittedly, at first we
111 would see a huge proliferation of weapons that would have only "macho" power.
112 In time people would cut back their could
113 reasonably afford.  Perhaps we might
114 also bring back dueling.  It isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Corporate 
115 executives might consider their actions a bit more if the penalty for injuring
116 people financially could cost them 
117 their lives.  Corporate ethics might then more nearly match personal ethics.

121 Challenging people to duels?  Could be interesting, especially if FCC 
122 passes the new packet switching regulation.  I doubt if many of the 
123 people on that committie would last long....
124 Let's look at the president issue from another viewpoint.  What made
125 ,no, makes a good president.  With what we have now, we have someone who
126 distributes athority, but still has a strong leadership image (note that
127 may or may not be only an image, but it is the image itself which is
128 important).  Who coming up has these qualities?  ANY of them?  It sure
129 dosent look like we're going to have many people worth voting for int
130 ,scratch that last, in the next election.

151   On a slightly different note -- it's lambing season.  Spring is on
152 its way and the little lambs are coming.  For someone who raises sheep,
153 it's a time of hard work and reward.  The miracle of birth is just that,
154 a miracle.  Sometimes, however, it turns into a tragedy.  It takes little
155 empathy to feel for a newborn creature rejected by its mother.  That happens
156 too.  I recieved a call last night from a neighbor who was lambing and had
157 a little bum lamb (one orphaned or rejected by its mother).  The little
158 critter was weak and the neighbor did not have time to hand raise it
159 (there is a limit to the work one person can do).  Last night was the night
160 of the midnight run to the neighbor's, coming home with a weak little
161 bundle of tight-curled wool held tight in my daughter's arms.  The little 
162 critter was so weak that it could hardly get down a couple of ounces of
163 sweetened warm milk.  
164   A couple of ounces was enough, though, with the encouragement of a 
165 six year old cheering squad.  First a couple of ounces, then a couple more.
166 This morning it drank three ounces and had a lot more strength.  There's
167 something very satisfying about seeing life come back to a nearly dead 
168 critter, as well as the glow in the face of a little girl that helped.

224 Not long afterwards (so it seemed to me), I awoke in a room that was part of a
225 building of fitted stone blocks, decorated with what could only be art (it was
226 at least as good as the types of art that humans were used to), and a few 
227 simple furnishings.  The bed in which I lay was constructed more like a bird's
228 nest than anything else.
229 Looking to the open window, I noted that I had been mistaken about the time;
230 I had slept the remainder of the day and through the night, it seemed.  The
231 sun had just cleared the horizon, throwing a reddish tint onto the world All.
232 Yob stood quietly at the door, puffing away at something in a manner quite
233 similiar to the habit of humans with tobacco.  "Feeling better, Erhuman?"
234 "Much better, thank you, Yob.  Your world has a lovely sunrise."
235 "Harumph.  They pale when compared to sunsets, Erhuman.  Perhaps you are lucky
236 today and enjoy its passing this night.  The Healer says you recover well, much
237 faster than Peepul.  Soon fit enough to travel, return to your home if needful."
238 "I hope I shall enjoy your sunset, Yob.  I thank you and the Healer for your
239 care.  I hope I may repay your kindness in some way."
240 "Again harumph.  No need for repay.  But I am curious about your world, your
241 own land.  Is it very much like All?"
242 I sighed.  "Not as much like as I'd like, Yob.  It seems to get better, then
243 worse...not really like All at all."
244 Yob frowned.  "Why stay?  Must be better places.  Go there, or stay here."
245 This was going to be difficult to explain.  "I stay because... I have, a gift,
246 Yob, a rare gift that I feel I must use to help my people, or anyone in need
247 of help.  I have a power, both inborn and taught to me...I shall show you."
248 I cupped my hands together, concentrating upon the flow of mystical energies,
249 blotting out Yob and the sunlight and my pain...
250 Nothing.  Nothing!
251 "Mighty Amigc... failed!  I have not failed in casting this spell since my
252 apprenticeship!  Not in any reality, no matter how remote, has it ceased to
253 work as it was intended...  it is based on the simplest laws of magic!  This

295 indows at the end of each hall. Wet cement was still just outside, and damp
296 ir was still around in the halls.
297 
        And so was I. I was wet, my hair was wet, and my overcoat was just
298 plain soaked in the rain. Everyone else was arranged in the end of the hall
299 and eating lunch. It was soon past the start of lunch, although no one ever
300 seems to notice the time during lunch. Everyone drifts to their fourth period
301 class as soon as they start to suspect the period is about to end. As of that
302 minute, it had occured to no one that lunch was about to end, so there
303 everyone was.
304 
        A friend looked up and out of his lengthy blond hair. And then he
305 presented a magnifying glass from one of his coat pockets. It was old, with a
306 brass ring around the crystal lens and a handle made out of dark wood. It
307 looked nice to have in a pocket. If not for ever using, then for looking at
308 stuff with when disinterest sets in. In an old and just as somber hall at
309 school, for instance.
310 
        He handed it to me, along with a few scraps of ancient paper. They
311 looked ancient, anyway. Each scrap was curled around other scraps and was
312 thinner than any other paper I had seen around for a while.
313 
        I went over to a patch of sunlight, underneath the tall windows that
314 are at the end of the hall near the auditorium. I set my bag down, and then
315 placed the scraps down also. Aligning the light as focused by the lens, I
316 directed it on the scraps of paper. The scraps were what was left of a Chinese
317 firework. It had been disected and the loose leaves of paper were all that was
318 left. It had no sinister appearance, it was just paper.
319 
        A stream of smoke was rising up from a scrap of paper I had magnified
320 and was floating off into the drafts when a staffer passed and distracted me.
321 The lens was still focusing light and directing it to a single spot on the
322 paper. It then blew up. It ignited a fuse within the wraps of paper which
323 detonated a powder charge, and it just blew up.
324 
        Scared the Hell out of me.
325 
        It had never occured to me that it would do that. I scoff at Fifties
326 safety films and ever laugh at the films about civil defense in the event of a
327 nuclear catastrophe. While this minor flair was not of the magnitude of a
328 nuclear device, it honestly discharged an explosive. No morals or even much of
329 a fable here, just please be careful.

342 The Republican convention was to be held in Richmond. Four hundred miles away,
343 or about three days ride on a Harley and with the wind at your back. Screams
344 from the chopper faded on down the turnpike like the exhaust fumes. Richmond
345 was the meeting of the New Right, and Geraldine was not about to miss this.
346 Congress was going to debate the free trade issue this Winter, and she was not
347 about to miss her chance to scare federal government panty-waists into
348 protecting the American bike industry. Her tight tee-shirt read "I'd rather
349 eat shit than ride a Jap bike" and she meant it. Her wheels were scraping off
350 asfalt on the Sherman Bridge outside of Richmond when the cop car showed up in
351 her rear view mirror. The chopper pulled off to the side of the road. The
352 figure on it let the forward wheel twist away from the road as it put glasses
353 on and lit up a cigarette. Puffs of marijuana and cloves faded into thin air
354 while the cop pounded the gravel up to the bike. Reaching for her liscence,
355 Geraldine pulled out a sawed off shot-gun from her leather overcoat and offed
356 the Jew cop. The other cop was hiding in the car as she pulled along it and
357 blew him away too. He was black. She was doing her bit for white supremacy
358 over the minorities. Then she rode. The weather was like it was the last time
359 she jousted with Harleys and chains in Kansas. When she got to the convention
360 center in Richmond, she used her Brit accent to get past the security as the
361 alluring and dangerous mistress of Candidate Kemp. A few kids were running in
362 the concrete corridors underneath the convention floor. She put them into
363 heavy industrial dumpsters and locked them in. One snot was put in a
364 refrigerator and she left him there for about five minutes. He must not have
365 held her breath or something, cause he was limp when she opened the door and
366 let him fall out. Word spread around the convention floor that Geraldine
367 Fallosse was in the convention center. She was soon drafted to the podium and
368 delegates from every state were cheering for her to assume the Presidential
369 mantle from their former idol, Ronald Reagan. A hush fell over the crowd as
370 she put her sour face up to the mike and sneered at it real mean like. "Fags"
371 she said, "Ron is the man for American, man! Give him another shot!" and then
372 she pointed her sawed off at the figure in the wheel chair. President Reagan
373 was left alone in the chair, drool running out of his mouth in a tube, and
374 wearing the same tee-shirt Geraldine was wearing. Conventioneers everywhere
375 cheered for their man. The New Right had been saved again by the
376 biker-statesman from the outer pits of Hell. Geraldine was getting off the
377 stage by riding her Harley down the main stairs when Nancy came up to her.
378 There should have been a needle in her arm the way she was pumped up full of
379 junk. The first lay was wearing a leather bra with tassles, and fish-net
380 stockings. Geraldine put her hand on the back of her head and pulled her head

382 before telling her how she hated the way Nancy's ass jiggled. Then she rode
383 again. Guess where she is now? Riding out west somewhere. Maybe near your home
384 town, and maybe near your wife and family.

386 After that, I can only say that I am speachless!!  An excellent satire!
387 ================================================ THE COURT JESTER =============
388 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
389 Ah yes, that brings back memories of my days on a BCC. It seems so long ago,
390 not so much by time, but by temperments. When I rode, it was the young 
391 American dream to criss cross the country on cycles. It was the way to go.
392 Free from uncle sam, free from pigs, free from the boss man, free to live
393 and ride for the sake of it. Damn, that was good.
394 
395 I remember one time coming out of Austin Texas. Those good old Texan boys
396 just plain didn't like us bikers. But they would only make their opinion
397 known when they were more of them than there were of us. Even cowards are
398 brave when there's a bunch of 'em. Anyway, we had been having a bit of fun
399 at one of the cafe's, called Earl's, I think. A fight had broken out between
400 the Indian, and one of the local boys. We all jumped in of course, Indian
401 was one of us, and we beat the living sh, er crap out of that good old boy.
402 He wasn't so good anymore, but he was plenty old after that. Someone must
403 have called ahead, because as we reached the city limits, a bunch of cars
404 and pickups were parked across the road, and a bunch of red necks armed to
405 the teeth with baseball bats and shotguns slung on their shoulders stood
406 around the vehicles. I was riding point and I saw them first. I motioned
407 the gang to head right, past the road block. Ginger, my hip hugger, yelled
408 in my ear something about being a chicken or something, so I gave a war
409 yelp, and we went smack dab in to the middle of the red necks. It was
410 pretty fierce fighting. Indian got his head blown off by a shot gun before
411 he even got off his bike, but someone on our side his a gas tank or some
412 thing with his iron and it blew up taking two or three more good old boys
413 to cattle heaven. Ginger jumped off before I got into the fray, which
414 spread out a bit across the road. Surprising there wasn't much gun play
415 after Indian got it and the truck blew up. I think those guys wanted to
416 fight, but not kill. You gotta remember that cow hands are tough, but they
417 don't live on the road on a bike. I have never seen a more hell-born
418 bunch of guys get into it like my gang that day. Even some of the women
419 ganged up on a couple of the red necks and made 'em sorry they were ever
420 born a man. I don't know how long it lasted. Time kinda flies by when
421 there's baseball bats swinging and jaws breaking. We managed to get
422 past the road blocks. Indian and another young kid who I never got to
423 know didn't ride away either.
424 
425 I guess that's kind of a not so happy story, but hearing about the Harley
426 hacker brought back some real memories.

435     An emptyness, a nothingless void.  
436    I try to see my way through it, 
437     I try to find a path to follow.
438    I have only my memories to guide 
439    me and the memories are wrong.
440     I stumble against objects that 
441    aren't there, I run up against 
442    walls I cannot see or feel.  
443     I follow glimerings of hope 
444    only to find them disappear days, 
445    weeks, months later. 
446     I thrash out in my rage, but 
447    there is nothing there.  I want 
448    to hold on to something, but 
449    there is nothing.
450     I am falling into an empty 
451    nothingless void.  
452     An endless ending.

458         The Final End of the Victorian Age
459 
        The papers flew through the steam and floated even higher in the warm
460 updraft. Runic writing was on the sheer leaves all though the penmanship was
461 of such poor quality that that it might have been an indecipherable cipher for
462 all it mattered, even if the pages had been flat on a table and not twelve
463 feet above the train platform.
464 
        About the only person who could have made sense of the script was the
465 man who stood at one end of the platform and wrapped in coat and scarf. His
466 curls of white hair were hanging in front of his twin eyes and hiding the
467 disparaging glances he gave each leaf as it fell.
468 
        The only other person who could have read those notes was his
469 confidential secretary and incidentally, she was his wife as well. Her
470 attention was at the ticket window and with the boy who was dealing her the
471 train tickets they would need to get to the conference so early the following
472 morning. Endeavoring to get them to the conference, she did not see the
473 accident in which the case that unlatched and fell open and so she did not see
474 the papers spill out onto the platform.
475 
        His duty now was to gather up the sheets that had fallen out, and do
476 it before they were ruined on the wet gravel or in the puddles that rested
477 with the rails in a ditch. He set his case down and latched it as he jumped
478 into the railway.
479 
        Vendors and travellers had lined the platform in an effort to pry
480 their trades while giving no mind to the noise or the commotion on the
481 platform. His wife had been done with purchasing the tickets and was now on
482 her toes, trying to see over the heads of the bustlers and the traffickers.
483 
        He was picking up a sheet and packing it into a coat pocket when a
484 ruffian noticed him. Eating an apple to pass the time of waiting for the
485 constabulary to lose him in the rail station, he saw the aging man fall into
486 the rift the train pulled through. A drop he then saw was a spry leap.
487 
        The scene was becoming more and more a spectacle as the toughie
488 started to watch. An old man was picking up his papers which had fallen from a
489 case on the platform, and a lady who obviously was his daughter or wife, was
490 looking for him in the crowd.
491 
        She saw her husband in the rift just as the rowdy spotted the train
492 rounding the last bend. The back to the coat and of the man was to the
493 oncoming train. His hearing was poor ever since his eardrum was shattered
494 during childhood and he could not hear the whistle as it tried to steam to a
495 stop.
496 
        His wife ran up to the edge of the rift and called to her husband. The
497 tough stood up from leaning on a vending stand and took a few paces toward the
498 rift. An engineer aboard the train noticed the fellow in the railway and
499 immediately set about bringing the train to a stop.
500 
        His honest opinion was that he could halt the engine in time enough to
501 not strike the old man under. He found out he was wrong as the old man fell
502 beneath him and was crushed under the weight of the metal goliath.
503 
        His wife had not been able to stand watching the death of her
504 brilliant and wonderful husband and had turned. Her hands were covering her
505 face and she heard the train whistle mingle with the scream her husband rang
506 out with as he died. That scream she heard for the rest of her life and felt
507 miserably glad that she had not committed the horrible sight of the death to
508 memory also.
509 
        The street tough strode calmly over to her and held her while she
510 sobbed. The engineer and conductor deboarded to look over the scene at the
511 front of the engine and train. The tough and the wife went on in life to marry
512 and spend the rest of their lives in the same town as her late husband had
513 died in. It came to pass that the tough died before she did all though she
514 never remarried, preferring not to try to recapture the essence of her life,
515 that day on the station platform.

536      On a mild azure day just sixteen years after his birth, Mars led a score
537 of his closest friends on horseback from the city of his fathers.  It was the la
538 st day of a fortnight of sunny days:  the lingering snow was gone, the sod
539 again firm.  A legion of scuttling fluffy clouds were painting that a spring
540 storm might soon descend with passion; but for now the world was newly verdant a
541 nd beautiful.
542      Mars was mounted on a superb ivory mare named Victory after the stallion
543 Balzor had ridden to the final battle of his Rivival.  A second reason for the
544 name was prophecy of gavril Joab:  "Seated upon the broad back of Victory ,
545 Mars and Venus will return to reclaim their ancient throune.  Know then the

564 	continue the events of the Brazil entry, and proceed to another
565 	notch in the plot. But, the entry is longer than the blank
566 	space on this disk. I have waited two nights but the disk isn't
567 	passing very quickly. Could you just advance the disk regardless
568 	of the last few lines? I will try to cut the entry down to fit
569 	the available space and check back tonight.

579  was not a large apartment. A central room, a bathroom, and a long
580 pane of glass for a window that showed the street. It was second floor and the
581 windows opened just slightly. The breeze was pleasant but the idea of flinging
582 out the window was better. Logistics was a rudimentary science meant for the
583 optimistic and a second story window was not of suicidal variety.
584  
585 	Newspapers lined the floor in a patchwork reminiscent of quilts made
586 from old scraps of cloth. Each article was cut from unlike papers. Each print
587 was distinct and held to the patchwork metaphor. Trust me on this one.
588  
589 	It was an old lady who sat in the center of the room. The view from
590 behind her eyes was that of a youth in pain. Her eyes squinted while memories
591 of her smarting knees ran through her mind. Her memories reverted to ones of
592 her son every few minutes. Contrasts of their times as children would come.
593  
594 	Questioning why was the dominant idea. Her son had died at the hands
595 of an American gun ship in the jungles of Panama and she just wanted to know
596 why that was. No answer was in the war stories on the news, no answer was in
597 the articles at her feet, and only relief would come from flinging herself out
598 the ajar window.
