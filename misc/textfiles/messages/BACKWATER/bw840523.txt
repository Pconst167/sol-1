25    The grey mass looming in the mist was definitely not an ordinary 
26 castle, it seems to be a cross between an regular midieval castle
27 and a more modern one built in the days of cannons with the smooth
28 angled sides. Somthing odd about the stone as well, an odd sheen,
29 along a near wall there were melt marks I recognized as being from a
30 photon weapon of some sort, but why it did not cut the stone like 
31 butter puzzles me even more.
32    On the second try the molecular grappling hook anchored itself into 
33 railing on the wall above, sinking into the solid material slower than 
34 it should. A quick twist of the end  of a 6" rod in my hand and I rise 
35 quickly up the wall.
36    On removing the hook and folding it onto the end of the spider-rod 
37 I notice the wall where the hook had been fastened, Crynalloy! But the
38 whole castle! I put the spider-rod and the .45 back into respective 
39 pockets on the inside of my jacket and removed a more ominous looking
40 item.
41    The "mechanical pencil" took care of the lock of the door, and after
42 stowing the laser again in a pocket I decended into the castle...

81    Well, all the people in here certainly a strange lot, but what can one expectfrom peasantry.  Actually I found this very
82 interesting. The host computer here must be 120 characters wide,  because it isreally messing up my screen. If anyone would 
83 like to tell me how to get a nice entry in, I'd be most gracious.  Lastly, ioperator, or someone with knowledge would like 
84 to leave either a message or a name I can contact to get information about the ssoftware runing the system, I would be again
85 most pleased.  And heck, I'm royalty!

120 Billy-Bob Bullyboy was a bit puzzled. His employer was paying him well to off these characters, but the conditions
121 of the contract were odd. He was picked up at his home by some strangely blank types who blindfolded him and
122 didn't let him see again until he was near the job. Oh, well, a job's a job, and a guy can't get too picky in 
123 today's economy, what with King Eleshaar's huge deficit and all...
124 His musing was interrupted by the arrival of his first customer. Now, if he just started the car without noticing 
125 the little trick he'd gimmicked up. Replacing the nitrous in the injection system with hydrogen should clean out 
126 the whole group here. Too bad about the Corwin guy, looks like he's too close to miss.
127 Yeah. One of 'em's getting in the car now.... .... ..... Whahsup? No explosion. Hmm, that's never happened before.
128 Oh, well, gotta keep trying to fill the contract. Maybe something simpler...

144 GREETINGS FOR LORD CHARLES MORBY, THE EARL OF BLACKPOOL...
145   You may rise.  Groveling is unnecessary, but flattery on the other hand...
146 Yee gads, this board fills up fast.  Well, anyone who wants to converse with
147 me can, I would be appreciative.  
148   Although I discovered about the "MA 80" command, thanx for mentioning it.

192      I  had  been fighting my way up the mountain for  some  time 
193 now,  and still I have not found a trace of Emer.  Yet I know she 
194 has  come this way as surly as a compass always points  north,  I 
195 can feel her presence.  The trees had turned to small shrubs, and 
196 soon  there would be nothing but mosses covering the ground as  I 
197 continue  ever upward.   The air had changed from the cosy warmth 
198 of  the  valley  to bitter cold lonelyness that  even  a  roaring 
199 campfire could not fully drive away.   There is a certain feeling 
200 here of being above the world, yet still it is lonely and barren, 
201 and  the  cold  bites deeply.   The power,  the  independance  of 
202 thought and action,  all this and I should be happy,  so why does 
203 the  cold bite so deeply?   Still I move on,  ever searching  and 
204 hopeing  to  come  upon Emer.   Why does she run  hiding  in  the 
205 shadows?   Does she fear my presence?   Once again I see a shadow 
206 flit from one outcropping of rock to another.   My senses tell me 
207 it is Emer.   I call out to her,  but she does not  answer.   Why 
208 does  she fear me so?   Is she afraid I will hurt her,  or is  it 
209 this  dark cloud that has been following me these last few years?  
210 I  sit back against a small depression in the cliff  wall  behind 
211 me,  warming my hands over the small fire I had built. Drawing my 
212 cloak about me,  I watch the sun set behind the clouds in the sky 
213 as a light snow begins to fall.    Ahh Emer, how I wish you would 
214 share my campfire.                                      
215                           *O* Tarn *O*

228 As they approached L'homme's car, the bard dragged the others into a 
229 doorway. "Look, isn't that someone messing with your car?" 
230 After some discussion they decided to act as if nothing was wrong. After
231 all, no "tech" devices would cause any trouble until they were quite a ways from
232 Amber. And Corwin & voyeur planned to use magic to get the car started on its
233 way.
234 Corwin bade them farewell as they drove off. A few lines away they stopped
235 the car so they could check it out while the bard attached his equipment. (It
236 always helps to be able to check things when hooking them up & since they didn't
237 work in Amber....)
238 "Hey, isn't a nitrous oxide tank supposed to be orange with a red band? 
239 This tank has a blue band!"
240 Bard looked up from where he was wiring a lap-sized console to the stereo.
241 "Hydrogen is orange with a blue band." he said turning back to his work.

251 Staring up at PAM from her chair, I realize my 
252 intrusion has been poorly taken. Fear grips me as I 
253 wait for the expected blow to come. As I sit there 
254 bound by my fear, the house and PAM begin to fade, 
255 and I find I am once again adrift on my makeshift 
256 raft still suffering from the ragging fever that 
257 caused the dream. I am drenched in sweat, yet my body 
258 shivers from the cold sea wind. I reach over to grasp 
259 my cup and dipping it in the small barrel I use to 
260 capture rain water in for drinking, I drink the 
261 slightly salty tasting water. As a wave raises the 
262 raft, I spy a dark speck on the horizon. Could it 
263 be?... But before I can see anymore of it another 
264 wave comes crashing down throwing my raft into 
265 another valley between the waves away from the speck. 
266 When next I get a chance to look, it is gone....

315 For a long time now the tunnel the orcs pulling them though had been rising
316 and circling around in a spiral. Suddenly it leveled off and emerged from
317 a cave mouth onto a ledge which curled around slightly and ended on the
318 lip of an enormous extinct volcano. As soon as they had reached level ground
319 the orcs collapsed with a few sideways glances at Greeneyes who had been
320 pacing alongside them. Apprentice, I think it must be time to change vehicles
321 again, Whisper said. Whats that over there on the edge of the slope. On 
322 closer examination the odd object apeared to be a toboggan. What I don't
323 understand is why it seems to made out of asbestos. What do you think?
324 Oh well, no matter we might as well get in. I'm sure we'll find out soon
325 enough. Do you think we should tip the orcs or will not being eaten by 
326 Greeneyes be tip enough? As the apprentice, Greeneyes and Whisper gingerly
327 seat themselves in the toboggin a large ruby set into the front of the 
328 machine glows and a voice speaks out of thin air. "Please make sure to 
329 stay within the red outline when it forms. Anything outside of it when the
330 journey commences will remain behind. This does mean fingers!" Crouching
331 down the party complies assiduously with the request, paying special
332 attention to possibly wandering tails. Seconds later the red outline 
333 vanishes, an incautious nudge establishes that some form of barrier has
334 replaced it, and with a dropping sensation the surrounding terrain
335 suddenly becomes that of a live volcano. With a woosh the toboggin falls
336 away down the slope in a spray of white hot lava. Gods, I hope this thing
337 is air conditioned, is all Whisper has time to say before a lava bomb 
338 bounces of the top of the toboggin. Greeneyes takes up most of their
339 attention after that. A five and half foot panicked cat certainly can
340 command a lot of attention can't she. Finally five minutes or five hours
341 later, who's timing this I'm busy, the apparently frail and now much hotter
342 craft shoots through a cut between to large rocks sails into the air.
343 Nice kitty, nice kitty, Whisper is heard to day from beneath five hundred
344 pounds of very pretty animal. With a loud Bamph the volcano vanishes
345 and sky blue wings sprout from the sides of the sled. After circling twice
346 it settles into a long glide. Where are we now Apprentice, can you see
347 a half smothered Whisper manages to gasp. I think we've finally made it
348 Whisper, that looks like the Inn down there next to that stream. If you 
349 think I'm ever going to take another one of your potions again though,
350 you've got three more thinks coming. About this time the ?glider slides
351 to rest not more than ten feet from the door of the Inn and promptly 
352 disintegrates in an odor of moldy cheese.

360 Tarn: I think she's Really gone.  Maybe you should turn your hand to
361 something more profitable (and less gloomy).
362 ::::::::
363 Grand Dragonmaster:  What is it that you are interested in?  Disorganized fantasy
364 adventures don't seem to catch your eye, maybe mystery, intrigue, James Bond/McKane/Ninja/Natasha
365 spy stories are more what you have in mind?  I'm afraid I can't help you there.

367 As the bard, L'homme, voyeur and Lord Corwin approached the plaza where
368 the car was parked, Corwin was lecturing voyeur on the fine points of manipulating 
369 Shadow.  Voyeur had finally decided that maybe he Did have the idea, when the bard
370 pulled them all over into an alcove, and brought their attention to L'homme's car,
371 where someone was being casual while trying not to seem too casual.  It was decided
372 to ignore it for the time being, since 'magic' would be operating the car for the
373 first portion of the trip, and when they stopped to activate the mechanical
374 aspects, they could check for traps.  Having decided this, they continued nonchalantly
375 to the car, where they made their farewells to Corwin.  The Lord of Amber
376 gave them their initial impetus, which voyeur, with his new-found talents, maintained;
377 shifting Shadow, making each reality a little less like Amber and a little more
378 like Innisfall.  Finally, the weakened influence of Amber, coupled with voyeur's
379 strain from the unaccustomed effort, caused him to call a halt.
380 "It's time to hook up your technical gadgets, bard. I've taken us as far as I can."
381 While voyeur rested and the bard performed the rites necessary to make the car
382 run 'normally', L'homme inspected his car.  He finally discovered that Hydrogen
383 had been substituted for the Nitrous Oxide.  Fortunately, he had a spare tank
384 of NO.  Making sure that the hydrogen tank was Tightly sealed, he put it
385 in the car.  "Never can tell when it might come in handy.  We might have
386 to inflate a balloon, fly over the Inn and drop bacteriological weapons on the Innvaders."

389    GREETINGS FROM LORD CHARLES MORBY, THE EARL OF BLACKPOOL...
390    Tally hoe!  Tally hoe!  Has anyone seen a fox?  Do you peasants even know
391 what a fox looks like?
392   Peasants : ( in unison )  The're cute, with dark eyes and big fangs!
393   Attention all disident peasants...rebelion will not be tolerated.  Ye gads
394 I give some mud, and some glop for the table, and look how ingrateful you lot
395 are.  I suppose Penal Reform and the ERA will be popular next.  How about a
396 public execution... I know of some jerks... executions always kept the 
397 peasantry happy.  That and catholicism.  It seems that you peasants just
398 don't appreciate a good thing when you see it.  I assume that all references
399 to invaders are pointing at his holliness ( me )?  Bacterialogical warefare,
400 don't make chuckle.
401    And your sure nodody has seen a fox?
402 Lord Morby - The Earl of Blackpool 
403   
404 Oh my.. I forgot the MA 80 command... I suppose this readout will look very 
405 silly.
406 *()#@*%)@#%*!)%*^$)#^*)#$^*)#*^)!*^)#*^)!*^)#%(_^*)^*!)^*&)%(&_(&_#(!&_(!(@&_&(
407 As Bard, voyeur, and myself walked to the car, I kept on thinking how out of
408 place I was here in amber. My magic skills, save a couple of card tricks, and
409 making of room full of people vanish when I start telling jokes, were nil.
410 My experience was in automobiles, 20th century computers, and sinking 20
411 footers with a hand in my face, none of which helped me much here. After
412 thanking Lord Corwin for his help with the car, we sped off into the distance.
413 It seemed strange to be moving in the car, but not have the usual low roar
414 of the engine keeping me company. And my stereo wasn't picking up any of
415 my usual radio stations... Finally, the power that allowed the car and its
416 passengers to begin their voyage back, faded. I didn't quite understand
417 how it worked, but who was I to question it. We finally came to a stop in the
418 middle of nowhere, which wasn't any place in particular, but seemed safe for
419 the moment. It was here I discovered what that strange fellow in amber was
420 doing to my car. Bard confirmed my suspicion - Hydrogen tank in the NO system.
421 I replaced the H2 tank with my spare NO tank, and set about trying to get the
422 car started, this time 92 octane premium leaded, not mystical magical fuel...
423 Bard was tinkering with the electrical system of the car, trying to hook up
424 some of his instruments, and voyeur was still a little dizzy from the thing
425 he called 'Shadow'. Again I didn't understand what shadow was, but I offered
426 him some mint cookies in the hopes they would make him feel better.
427 Considering all the car had been through, it didn't seem to be in that bad of
428 condidtion. I warned Bard I was hooking up the battery again, and after some
429 tinkering with manual choke and a slightly sticky float, I finally got the
430 engine to roar to life! Ah yes...this is sounding more like home all the
431 time. I disconnected the battery again to allow Bard to continue working on
432 the system with out getting electrocuted, and set about doing mundane engine
433 things with wd-40 can in hand. "We are ready to take off as soon as you are
434 done Bard.", I called out to him. "Balloon assualts voyeur? That sounds like
435 a bad NBC mini-series I saw on TV two days before my eventfull drive to Tek."

494   GREETINGS FROM LORD CHARLES MORBY, THE EARL OF BLACKPOOL...
495   I'm by no means one and the same with the Digital Man.  Besides that his user
496 name is somewhat silly ( mine also, but I like it ), he can't type worth a damn.
497   I belive that the answer that the answer to the antimatter - matter ratio
498 question is one to one.  I'm most likely wrong though.  
499   If writing short stories is the thing to do, I suppose I can accomidate the
500 peasantry.  But I'd much rather just fill up space with humor and such.  And
501 about the fox...
502        Tally hoe! Tally hoe!      Lord Morby
503 
504   Three ending notes: 1) Attention Digital Man- learn how to capitalize!
505                       2) For gods sake, will you peasantry try to get my 
506                          name right.
507                       3) Star Trek Question - what is Sulu's first name.
508                          Hint.. it isn't Pavel.

510 Man in Gray: the bard is with me and L'homme.  apprentice is with
511 Whisper and Green Eyes.
512 Interesting theory on /pcs.  But what about Digital Man, Lord Morby, 
513 the other 'royalty' recently appearing (probably in response to L. Morby),
514 and Quizmaster? (There are probably more, but I can't recall their names
515 off hand).  Or are they too new to fit into your 'calulations'?
516 In any case, keep up the good work.  Such information, if validated, could
517 on occasion be useful
518 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::O O:::::::voyeur:::::::::O O::::::::::::::::
519 p.s. to DUNT: I just found your note.  Definitely not a good place
520 to leave something important.

522 To who asked: I usually work on Saturdays and can't attend PorSFiS. I have
523 attended, however, and go whenever I'm off work.
524 On the subject of Edlin: I just got a copy of PC-WRITE 3.0. It's better then
525 Word Star and public domain. The help section is much better then 2.0. Leave
526 a mesage if anyone wants a copy.

547 LS LIKE BARNICLES AND CORAL) AND ONE FOR ALL MOBILE FORMS; MOST ANIMALS AS SUCH,
548   SCIENTIENTS SUCH AS OURSELVES, (WELL SOME OF US ANYWAY, AT LEAST I HOPE) AND 
549 SELF MOBILE MECHANICAL DEVICES.
550 
551     2:  USE OF THERE AND THAIR.  i SEE NO NEED FOR MORE THAN TWO FORMS FOR ONLY 
552 TWO DESTINCT FUNCTIONS.  I WILL (ATTEMPT TO) USE THERE FOR ALL INDICATIONS OF 
553 PLACE AND THAIR FOR ALL INSTANCES OF MULTIPLE POSSESSION!

562   The halls were lit with wooden torches with chemophosphorescent tips, an odd
563 mix of technologies, the style seemed oddly familair. Though the traps in the
564 castle had been very sophisticated technologically, they were easily foiled
565 with simple spells even a novice could have done, that novice would not have
566 detected them in time however. Soon I was facing a large metal door.
567   As the laser silently cut through the locking mechanism I listened to the
568 sound of machinery and electronics behind the door. I could hear one person
569 typing somthing into a computer terminal. Unfortunately the door was not as 
570 silent as the laser and the person whirled with a weapon in hand, to face 
571 the cold, blunt end of the .45. "You!" the person in the chair exclaimed.
572   "Croll, I should have known it was you, who are you working for this time?"
573   "Do you think I would tell you?"
574   "No, but you will anyway, one way or another. You see, your employer is
575 trying to take possesion of somthing a number of people care for quite dearly
576 and are not willing to part with."
577   "I could care less about your little Inn," declared Croll.
578   "Obviously, who is your employer and where can he/she/it be found?"
579   "Never!" and with that Croll whirled an struck somthing on the control
580 panel, just before my bullet entered his brain.
