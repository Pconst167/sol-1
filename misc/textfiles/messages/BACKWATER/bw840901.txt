21   Knucking sleep out of his eyes, the piper started down the rough-hewn
22 steps to the inn's common room.  At the landing where the stairs bent, he
23 paused to inspect the room.  The early morning sun sent bright beams 
24 slanting across the vacant space lately filled with noise, merriment,
25 and discussion.  Leaning on the baulstrade of peeled poles, the piper
26 wondered what had happened to many of his old companions.
27   Where had the bard gone?  Many days had passed since the room had
28 resounded to his lively songs.  The apprentice had not shown up to regale
29 the inngoers with tales of magic and sorcery, LeRoy McCane had mysteriously
30 dissappeared (died of WHAT???) L'Homme was gone a-questing, MiG seemed to
31 have gotten entrapped in some arcane battle for control of the world.
32   Pam was still gone -- he had met her but breifly when he had come back
33 to the inn -- and still farther back before the inn had even taken shape
34 many members of this alternate reality had vanished.  Who still remembers
35 the sysop of the Damash Bulletin Board?  Ah well ... 
36   He straightened up and continued down the stairs.
37 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

39 nostalgia)

43 M.M. - I am still thinking.  Perhaps we are not taught that knowledge

46 Archives - I have RDCPM, and can provide my own 8 inch disks.  How many do

56 So many people to respond to, will I ever answer them all?
57 Mikey : We could arrange a time for the 20may83 file to be posted on drive B. I could then download it, and that would
58         be that. If we can arrange a time, I am sure you could bump whoever was hogging- I mean using the system at
59         that time. As for PCS, I will bring $12 for the 3 new disks. If Aaron has payed you, I guess that's about all
60         I was holding over him as far as blackmail goes. He still has to call me and let me know when he can pick the
61         disks up though. There is still time to milk some more money out of him. We shall see...
62 Alex : September the 8th sounds great. I will make sure everyone finds out. I can bring my old wooden set, since every-
63        one knows that vile orange liquid doesn't adhere to wood as well as plastic, since it has more in common with
64        plastic than it has with wood. Perhaps you missed my last entry on Global Economic disaster. If you do not with
65        to pursue the subject, that is OK with me. Until the 8th then, and may the best dice win. I will warn you that
66        I have forsaken science and enrolled in Madam Rosa's dice rolling school. She teaches dice techniques that will
67        garner 400's at Yahtzee everytime. Back Gammon, no problem with sucessive double 6's, and Risk, well why don't
68        we just wait until the 8th to see.
69 Laz  : We don't need another set of 8 inch disks floating around. If you can read the IBM SS/SD standard format CPM 
70        disks, then there should be no problem. I assume you can copy from those 8"ers to you own storage device?
71 To Old Timers of BW : I have been reading some of the old files, and there were indeed several fine debates and dis-
72 cussions occupying BW's disks. There seemed to be much more dry wit and humor, and not as many snide remarks made by
73 passersby. But that is not to say that the past was much much better than the present. It was certainly different, and
74 the content was more pleasing to read for those who enjoy a good reasonably educated discussion.

93 Hum, I must be slipping. You sound like a Timothy L. deciple, are you?
94 Alex:September 8th? I can make it but I must leave early. My motorola rep invited
95 me to a 68020 seminar for wednessday so I will not be home. 
96 All Riskers:Last night I was experimanting with random dice rolling. I rolled
97 50 rolls with a partner and using slighly madified risk rolling scores found them
98 to be compleatly random. When a dice cup was involved, they either bent twords my
99 partner or myself with no reasonable reason to do so. Other then eating lemon cake
100 batter with our fingers and it being late at night the conditions closly matched 
101 a risk game. That proven, I slaughtered both of the other players in a quick
102 game of risk. I kept rolling 4-5-6 combinations and they were into 3-4-5
103 combinations. Anyone else care to try finding out why this happens? It
104 kinda bugs me if you know what I mean.

109 A proposal for a new discussion topic:
110 
111      A solution to the vaguries of present software copyright laws and a draft 
112 proposal of a new, universal software copyright notice.   Fantasy is fun,
113 political discussions <arousing!>.  However, I have noticed little in the
114 way of constructive problem solving going on here for quite some time.
115 Many of us are directly involved with the copyright question, and all of us
116 are affected by it in some way or other.  Any takers?

162 So, nobody wants to talk about the "Future" here on BWMS?  The reason why
163 a discussion never gets off the ground is that everyone wants to talk about
164 something different than what is being brought up.  Thats fine but there are
165 always three/four topics on the air.  People that try to involve themselves
166 into all of them just get everyone else messed up so they will bring up a 
167 new topic.  A debate would be nice but BWMS would always have the pranksters
168 that would call up and leave total junk, tieing up line time.  Oh well, 
169 I guess that it's not going to change one little bit.  This message will
170 go into one ear and right out the other.     IS ANYONE AWAKE?   .  It
171 would be nice to have EVERYONE onto the same topic.  Maybe if the system
172 operator could choose from one that is already up and post his choice.
173 At least that would at least suggest a universal topic.
174 But, what about the topic of future advances and technology in that time?
175 Oh well, in one ear and out the other.

179 It is time once again for SPELL CHECK. As part of an ongoing research project
180 into the American education system, SPELL CHECK roams the country searching
181 for subjects to test. The Back Water Message System was chosen because of
182 its popularity and unusual clientele.
183 
184 The results of our test can be interpreted as follows:
185 
186         A typo is any type of error our testers deem was caused by a typing
187 error, rather than by a lack of spelling knowledge.
188         A misspell is any type of error our testers deem was caused by a
189 lack of spelling knowledge on the writer's part.
190 
191 Our results show an interesting statistic. There are many poor typists as
192 well as many poor spellers out there. Slang terms, non-normal vernacular,
193 and colloquial terms are not included in the testing.

222 A few notes in summary. A (*) preceding a name signifies that person had
223 no typos or spelling errors in his messages. Our testers gave no weighting
224 to the amount of writing done by the subjects, therefor several of the
225 subjects who had perfect scores did so with a minimum amount of writing (three
226 lines), and many who had several errors did so with a large amount of writing.
227 An improved scoring method will be utilized for the next testing round.

233 Spell Check: Let he who is without syntax error cast the first stone. You might give consideration to unknownguy's
234 high-falutin words, too. Anyone can log on and enter 19,000 three letter words, and not have spelling errors. If I
235 didn't know better (and I don't), I'd think I don't know who were co-conspirators in this "spell check". (Migguy
236 , a 680what seminar?).
237 (snicker). Anyway, I was reading about someones entry about bickering. Reminds me of when I was in Mexico City. I got
238 on this bus, and the driver was smoking this big blck cigar. Well, this lady got on carrying a poodle.(Fifi, what 
239 else). Anyway, they started arguing. The smoke was causing poor Fifi to sneeze. The lady(?) demanded that the driver
240 throw his cigar out the window. They argued heatedly for a while, and then the driver said, " Lady, I'll throw it 
241 out if you'll throw that damn mutt out. The woman was so incensed, that she did. She threw the doggie out the window.
242 (sorry) The bus driver had to comply, of course, an threw the stogie out his window----. Well, the lady was, of course
243 aghast at what she had done, but it was to late, th bus was going sixty MPH. In a little while, the bus came to the
244 rest stop at the end of the line. I looked out my window, and what did I see? That little dog, running like heck to
245 catch up with the bus!!. You'd never guess what he was carrying in his mouth!
246 WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE OR WHAT. THE DOG WAS CARRYING THE BUS DRIVERS CIGAR, RIGHT?
247 To above: No, not the bus drivers cigar. It was that brick.

307 When I read the joke a couple of years ago, the lady got ticked
308 at the bus driver and threw his cigar out the window, which
309 got the bus driver mad and he threw the dog out the window.
310 Also, I might point out that you waited so long between jokes
311 that you are going to get a lot of people saying 'What brick'?
312 It is important that you use proper timing to make a joke effective.

335 To anyone who wants a change of discusion:
336 
337 Has anybody read the article about the KKK in yesterday's Oregonian?
338 I think that the KKK should think about what they are doing. They 
339 terrify the Indians; did they ever think of who was here first? They
340 beat up blacks; did the blacks have a choice on whether to come here
341 or not? They leave hate mail for other immagrants; frankly I would be 
342 honored that so many have left there homeland to start what they hope
343 is a better life here in my country.
344 I wonder how many KKK members are true americans. Mabey I should clear
345 up my definition of a true American. A true American is a native Indian
346 because he and his ancestors were here first. They did not invite us to
347 come in and take there land. Just think guys, the English were not even
348 the first on this continent. An explorer by the name of Liegh Ericksen
349 was the first here. He didn't stay long and didn't leave much of a sign
350 that he was here so when Spain came over they thought they were first.
351 They soon found out otherwise when the Indians decided to introduce 
352 themselves. What did Spain do? They attacked and robbed the Indians of 
353 all valuable items.
354 
355                                  Have a nice day,

398 Hi All,
399 Question:  How do you know that car up ahead isn't filled with
400 communists?  Red hearted people just waiting to take over all the BBS's
401 Here's your answer:
402 Edgar J. Hoover's 8 Ways to Spot Cars Carrying Communists
403 ---------------------------------------------------------
404 1.  Driving alternatly at high and low rates of speed.
405 2.  Entering a heaviltraled inter
406 section on a yellow light.
407 3.  Turning coners at high rates of speed and stoping apprutly.
408 (Sounds like I'm a communist so far.)
409 4.  Stoping on one-way streets and walking opposite the trafic direction.
410 5.  Cuting into a side alley and extinguishing car's lights.
411 6.  Driving in rural areas, walking accross fields and being picked up by
412 another car.
413 7.  Waiting until the last minute to make a left turn in front of oncoming
414 traffic.
415 8.  Stopping at every gas station on the freeway, always looking, and
416 then going on.
417 Yep, there they are.  Watch for them.

424 Dear Lord, I am a car driving communist.
425 Spell Check:Consider my systems TOTAL cost was less then 100 bucks. I have
426 no spell checker program to run, no 80 column screen to line up with.
427 And better things to do with my time then worry about my spelling.
428 If you do not have the brains to understand what I wrote, and most folks do,
429 I will write just for you in a simple 3 line message of no meaning.
430 Alex:I have repeted the famed dice cup experiment, same results. 5 smaplings of
431 50 rolls each. I eagarly await a one/one session...

434 Migguy: how much you spend on a computer has nothin much to do with your spelling. I didn't spend
435 much on this system, but you don't see me making errors. (nyuck nyuck). 
436 All I got so far was #9, Poached eggs on toast. My printer stripped a gear, so I can't down load it to
437 work on. Here is another one.

443 of small willpower from cheating, I have coded the answers using a VERY complex cypher.

454 P.S. to  A. User - I don't give a ____ about your terminal tests.  They waste
455 a lot of space with no possible benefit to anyone.  Do us all a favor and
456 delete your tests after you have spewed them all over the board.
457 ????????????????????????????????? QUIZMASTER ???????????????????????????????
458 .............................................................................
459 Quizmaster- 
460    Yes this is true. The intent was not to cause you or anyone else a problem.  It seems to me though that you could 
461 have spared me the vulgarity and simply stated that you didn't like the 30 lines that I used for the tests. It would 
462 seem to me that if you have a problem with 30 lines that the massive waste of 
463 blank lines that I have seem on BWMS probably gives you a corallary! But thank 
464 you. I promise to be a good little no-excess-line st 
465 
466 aler in the future.
467 
468 Please do the same.

476   FROM PROMETHEUS: THE ILL FATED
477 
478   FOR THOSE WHO WONDER; I AM NOT A. USER. MY TESTS ARE RARE AND DO NOT TAKE UP LARGE AMOUNTS OF SPACE.
479   I TRY NOT TO DO THAT, ALL I DO IS FIND A CARRIER, ANY CARRIER AND TEST THE LOWERCASE SENDING, DUPLEX, AND CARRIER DETECT
480 SECTIONS OF MY TERMINAL.
481   I DO HOWEVER WANT VIP TERMINAL FOR MY COLOR COMPUTER SO I CAN FINALLY DOWNLOAD! IF ANYONE HAS ANY HELP THEY COULD GIVE ME IT
482 WOULD BE STRONGLY APPRECIATED! I AM IN SUDDEA DOWNLOAD ANY DOWNLOAD! GIVE ME DOWNLOAD OR GIVE ME VIC!
483 00
484   DICE CUP EXPIRIMENTERS; I DID A TEST OF THE PHEMOMENA AND DID ONE HUNDRED THROWS OF THREE DICE AND FIFTY OF TWO.
485 
486   THE AVERAGES WERE; TWO FOR THE ATTACK DICE, AND 4 FOR VICTIM'S DICE. I WANNA TRY IT IN A GAME SITUATION,TOO.
487   BUT UNTILL THEN I AM TRYING TO FIND ANY MAFIA OR DENTAL ASSOC. TIES TO IT.
488 
489   JOKEMASTER; YOU WOULDN't HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LITTLE JOKE ON BIT BUCKRECENTLY, OR WOULD YOU?
490 
491   QUIZMASTER; I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN QUIZMASTER FORM AROUND FOR A LON TIME. WHY NOT?
492   AND BY THE WAY, WHAT ARE, ER, WHAT IS THIS LATEST QUIZ?
493 
494 
495   CUSTOMER QUESTIONERS; LOOKING BACK THROUGH MY DICTIONARIES IT SEEMS THAT THE INFORMAL USE OF ' CUSTOMER ' MEANS ANYONE WITH
496 WHICH ONE MUST DEAL WITH. BUI DON'T BELEIVE THAT WAS HOW SPELL CHECK MEANT IT.
497 
498   THEN AGAIN IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME WELL; WHEN I WAS IN PORTLAND SPELLING COMPETITIONS (STEPPING STONE TO THE COUNTY, STATE
499 AND FINALLCOMPETITION ) IF YOU MISTAKENLY SPELLED THE WORD WRONG YOU COULD CLAIM THAT IT WAS THE BRITTISH SPELLING
500 AND THEY WOULD LET YOU CONTINUE THE COMPETITION UNHINDERED.
501 
502   I SAND BY THE WAY; I KNOW NIECHE (SP?) AND IT ISN'T LYSIAS. SORRY ALL.
503 
504 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
505 SORRY FOR ALL THE TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS BUT HALF AN HOUEDIT AND RE-EDIT HAS DONE IT NO GOOD, I REALLY AM SORRY. PROMETHEUS.
506 ...............................................................................
507 Prometheus from A. User -
508     I don't believe that any apologies are nessecary. My opionion is that one
509 of the purposes of PUBLIC bbs is for testing, trying out new modes ect.. I
510 am trying out a new software/hardware system tonight and it seems to me 
511 that people that have problems with the experiments and testing have lost
512 the true spirit of what personal computing is about. To me that is a test,
513 a trial, an adventure that doesn't always work, but still MUST be tested.
514 The PUBLIC bbs are a trial base much like ham radio. It is a tool to be used
515 for the test, not to the detriment to anyone, but as a basis for improving
516 thpersonal computing. If the room that I utilized on the disk to night was
517 wasted by some peoples standards, well so much for that, it was not intended
518 to infringe on anyone. But people that can not relate to the process of trail of new systems really iritate me. I believe that
519 you Prometheus have no reason to apologize for what you are doing ... keep
520 it up  ... A. User  aka  Paul Abbus.
521 ................................................................................
522 this software keeps injecting about 10 lines of blanks for some reason ... I'll
523 work on it    P.A.

HELLO< I wish to appologize for my

ignorant vandalism, I assure you it was
542 
entirely unintentional.  I am a new user

and was not familiar with your system.
544 
I believe I now know how to read and
545 
enter messages onto your system.
546 
Suggestions to owner/operator:
547 
     A.  A special command to help newcommers
548 
     B.  A command to prevent your computer from echoing back to ..

551 
To MM: Perhaps power is as simple as the knowledge that you already have
552 
        unlimited amounts of it if you just realize it?
553 
To Spelcheck: OK for you to check my spelling, If you tell me what wo
554 
were mispelled so I will know better.  Critisism without even correct
555 
is wnot criticism at it's best.
556 
557 
Sorry again about my inadvertant destruction of some of the fine messag
558 
on this system.  Thank you.
