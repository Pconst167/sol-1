22 Tanya: Frank was a fictional character that one of the writers here (I say not
23 who) used to spark interest during one of Backwater's duller moments/weeks.
24 Despite some name-calling, a reasonably intelligent conversation developed.
25 From what I gather on drive B, that person is not the Frank I recall.
26 nelsons: I sent another message today (11/4/85) to 'psu-cs!nelsons', and got
27 the same 'Message sent to 1 external user(s) successfully'.  Perhaps it is
28 going somewhere else?  Is there a confused user over there with a plethora
29 of misguided messages?

32 one of the 'better writers'. 68020

34     At his request, Emu and Bard joined hands with Cragmore to form the
35 potent semi-circle.  Cragmore started the process, leading with quiet
36 instructions to relax; to breathe deeply, quietly; to concentrate upon
37 the center of the open circle...
38     The collective conciousness that formed of Bard, Cragmore and Emu
39 quickly gained strength.  With Cragmore's direction, they sought out 
40 Trainor's torchered mind.  All standard psi training forbids the
41 unauthorized entry of one mind into another's, and Emu had never
42 progressed past the second level of training.  Even so, all of Emu's
43 training screamed against the planned intrusion.  Cragmore recognized
44 this hesitance in Emu's mind and quickly assured Emu that this was the
45 inevitable exception to the rule.
46     Together, the three minds entered Trainor's mind.  Bard, with almost
47 no training, was at first taken aback at the utter confusion and disarray
48 that he could sense in the raging conciousness in that mind.  Even Cragmore
49 was surprised at the emencity of the job that lay ahead of them, but that
50 didn't at all dissuade him from continuing.  They quieted emotions.  They
51 relaxed motor control.  They cooled the blind rage and mentally massaged
52 Trainor into a deep slumber.
53     Once the physical body was out of danger and the upper brain functions
54 put to sleep, the three went to work on the subconsious.  They quickly 
55 found the red, aching rips in the ego, no longer hidden under layers
56 of time and guilt.  In the silent blue light of Trainor's intelect, they
57 worked.  They first mended the rent fabric of Trainor's subconsious
58 reason.  A short corrected there, a new connection here, a suggestion
59 over there, and they pulled back a little.
60     Next were Trainor's memories.  The most recent were softened, and
61 knowledge of the intrusion was added.  As a final touch, Cragmore touched
62 the cell grouping that held several of Trainor's early, forgotten
63 childhood scenes.  Now they could retreat.
64 
65     "Trainor should sleep for an hour or so, now, and I suspect that he'll
66 dream of his fourth birthday party," Cragmore answered Emu's and Bard's
67 questioning looks.  "We cooled the anger, yet left the memories that it
68 ingrained.  Trainor has to know what is within his own mind.  That is also
69 why we gave him knowledge of our intrusion.  I think that he is intelligent
70 enough to understand why we did it, and will forgive the indescretion of
71 our intrusion."
72     Emu glanced at the glow coming from the stateroom.  "What about
73 them?" he asked.
74     Bard echoed these sentiments.  "Can we find out what is happening within
75 that room while we wait for Trainor to wake up?  Maybe we can get things
76 straightened out before he does."
77     "Well, it's worth a try," answered Cragmore.  "Join hands again.  This
78 time though, we'll have to put much more energy into out(ch /out/our )
79 (bah! enter only...) our efforts if we plan to break through the barrier.
80 The risk we take is in injuring the mind that is holding it up.  We must
81 proceed with extreme caution.  Concentrate..."
82    "Whoa!"  Emu nearly jumped out of his skin in surprise as the barrier
83 came down just as they touched it.
84     "Seems like they're expecting us," commented Bard.  At that, the physical
85 door opened to reveal Tayree and 'Zeb', who both immediately went to Trainor's
86 reclined body.
87     "We 'watched' you touch him," said Tayree.  "He will be more relaxed
88 now.  thankyou, all three.  Now, I'd like to introduce you to someone very
89 special.  Cragmore, Emu, Bard, meet Aedem."

94    The outside pressures shifted again but this time the walls didn't groan. They screamed. James thought their time
95 was up as he and Tariya were thrown together violently. But the collapse stopped when the sphere was about half its
96 previous size. The increased air pressure tried to push his eardrums in. Why was he suddenly thinking about air
97 pressure?
98    Tariya clung to him bitterly and he felt her warmth and softness. It made him feel all the worse about what he had
99 to do. She whispered hoarsely, "Please. Do it now, while there's still time!"
100    James felt his heart tear in two. He didn't want to die, but neither did he want to do this. He was backed into a
101 corner with no way out. What ABOUT air pressure?
102    Tariya's heart pounded against his chest. "I'm scared." she whispered against his neck.
103    "So am I, babe." James muttered. Air pressure, time pressure, what was he trying to see?
104    Then it clicked into place.
105    A flash of light filled the chamber and the blade was in his hand again. Tariya saw it and squeezed her eyes shut.
106 It wouldn't be so bad if she didn't see it coming. James thought long and hard for a moment, calculating. He held the
107 sword away from them and swung it in circles. It made a humming noise as it moved though the air.
108    "Okay." he whispered, finally. Tariya tensed up, ready for the blow. The blade moved like a blur.
109    What happened next took place far too quickly for the normal human mind to follow. First, the tip of the sword
110 described a circle against the wall of the bubble. The edge left behind it a glowing blue line. Then they were both
111 surrounded by a cocoon of pure telekinetic force, to absorb shocks. The walls of the bubble trembled perilously.
112    The blue lined circle flared up in brightness. Gravity vanished as the wall inside the circle fell away. Then it
113 all happened at once.
114    In the zero-gee James dropped the sword and grabbed Tariya as tightly as he could. He kicked up and pushed against
115 the opposite wall with his feet, using all the power he could divert to his legs. They were propelled like a jet
116 towards the hole as the walls slammed inwards on themselves.
117    Air pressure blasted them headfirst through the warpgate just barely ahead of the collapse. They flew like bullets
118 and James watched as the 'gate swallowed himself millimeters behind his heels. Another fraction of a second could have
119 cost him both his feet.
120    James caught a glimpse of sunlight and blue sky as they flew almost three hundred yards from the point where they
121 entered this world. They slammed into the sandy ground, leaving a respectable crater. If not for that telekinetic
122 cocoon, they would have made a splat instead. They bounced twice more before coming to a stop.
123    Because of the cocoon, Tariya had noticed none of this, just a general disorientation. She let go of the
124 semiconcious James and sat up, blinking in amazement at the surroundings. They were on a beach. Behind the beach was a
125 thick deciduous forest. The sunlight was blinding but it would soon get better because one of the suns was
126 setting.

135     prior to meating Dreamtoucher, person had known only iron clad self
136 disiplan.  freedom was an intriguingly alien concept a gift from the elven
137 dreamshaper.  a subtle paradox to contemplate in moments of solitude.
138     person had ben watching the shadow of a rock, waiting for it to move, 
139 and contemplating that very alien puzzle when the frayed edges of that dessert
140 realm had begun to unravel.
141     The elven mystic, though unusualy centered and well ordered for his people
142 was ill at ease.  The long months of dessert sand weighed heavily.  And if
143 Dreamtoucher's mind was agitated, Snowrunner's was positivly churning.
144     person's detatchment did not prevent awairness of empending oblivion.
145     if the dark fallower who lurked in the cobble's shadow were to escape now;
146 it would be availed but little.
147     person's duty done, it was with a sense of snug compfort the merging into
148 dreamtoucher's physical prescence through the pours of his right forearm.
149     Snowrunner leapt to her feet, nose keen as if on the trail of a new scent.
150     Dreamtoucher settled himself astride her sturdy canoid forquarters.
151     A single thought, shaired by three perceptions; *NOW*
152     Reality became a mist of swrling psicodelic clouds experienced in more
153 dementions than the awairness usualy acknowledges.
154     Like the wind itself they ran.  Three minds as one on sturdy wolvish feet.
155     The mists thinned and through them trees began to appear.  Soon the mists
156 vanished entirely as the forrest flew past on eather side.  The scent of pine
157 wafted on air of crystal clarity.  Like a transparent sweet toned bell the
158 lungs drank air of exotic purity.
159     the feeling was one person would not soon forget.  so many wonderful days
160 were likewise passed learning the ways of an independent spirit.  too many to
161 recount every new page of expirence as it unfolded.
162     Though the days were long and sweet on the world of two moons, Dreamtoucher
163 never forgot the strainge new friends he had met at a place called INN.
164     Seasons came around, and came around again.  More and more he thought of
165 INNisfall and INNkeeper Mikey, the magicly always burning hearth-fire, the
166 aile, the chear, the stories told.
167     The day came when hearts were full, perhaps too full.  Dreamtoucher's 
168 thought was *NOW* and person knew just what that implied.
169     "perhaps, young rabbit, well speak again of those days, and at greater 
170 length.  sufficeth for now that all things end yet in ending begin again, not
171 in endless repatition, but each time new, unique, never to be repeated quite
172 the same.  sufficth to say; 'we are here'."

193 
194      I hardly noticed the traffic jam on the 205 bridge as I drove back to Portland. My mind was elsewhere.
195      The cops were directing traffic around the two lanes on the outside, where the hole was. I had an excellent view of
196 it as I drove by. Twelve feet of concrete barrier had been sheared off and, presumably, lay on the bottom of the
197 Columbia. They would probably close the bridge soon to fix it and everybody would be stuck using I-5 again. Once I got
198 past the congestion traffic returned to normal and I could drive normally again. That was fine by me. I wanted as far
199 from that hole as possible. I didn't need the reminder.
200      Ten o'clock last night. I was on my CB as usual, talking with Roy. Jennifer was at her house in Vancouver but her
201 radio wasn't on. Roy was in his truck, heading for his place in Portland.
202      Roy and Jen and I, we were a team. On the CB, which may not mean a whole lot to most folks but it did to us. There
203 was something about the location of our three base stations that made it virtually impossible for any signal to come
204 between us. For the last year or so, we all three of us took advantage of this situation to plant ourselves on channels
205 and carry on conversations over top of whoever was on the channel at the time. Rarely could they talk when we talked.
206 The results were usually quite hilarius, at least to us.
207      Our activities weren't restricted to radio, though. Roy and I had been best friends for years. He and Jen, however,
208 were considerably closer than that. Which made what happened all the harder.
209      Roy was his usual cheerful self on the radio: "Hey, guy, where are ya?"
210      "This is station 503 located in Salem, Oregon." It was amazing how many people actually believed me when I said
211 that. "I'm sitting here at my desk as usual, you dipstick! Where the **** are YOU?!"
212      "Just about to hit the bridge. And watch your language!" He laughed. "You're gonna burn up my reciever!"
213      "I should be so lucky. Where's Lady Couger?"
214      "I think I left her too exhausted to talk. I know I almost am. You know, this bridge goes by fast at ninety."
215      "It usually does until you get pulled over. You sure that thing is safe at ninety?"
216      "Sure it is. Hey, are we still going shooting tomorrow? I wanna try out those .44 hotloads I made the other
217 night."
218      "Sure, as long as I can get something solid between us in case you blow the gun up. You came close enough last
219 time."
220      "No prob. I'll bring my portable bullet-proof shield. Hey, I think I... HOLY-"
221      His signal was cut off just that quickly. At first I was startled, but then I remembered when he had pulled this
222 trick before. I wasn't falling for it again. About every minute or so I called his name and waited for a reply.
223      After forty minutes I started to worry. Just a little.
224      I turned on my AM for some music while I sat there waiting. On the hour they played the news.
225      "...a Ford pickup truck smashed through the safety barrier on the I-205 bridge about an hour ago. The vehicle fell
226 one hundred and sixty feet to the water. The police are attempting to retrieve the wreckage. A police spokesman said the
227 vehicle must have been travelling at least eighty miles an hour when it struck..."

235 Gee whiz, I almost hate to enter in another chapter from my story. This disk
236 is full of nothing but...
237 But I need to get it in, so sorry all you story-haters, it looks like Backwater
238 is turning into a true-blue story board!
239 
240 The Bear leaped about a half dozen steps, and then slammed into the wall to his
241 left. There was a small indentation where he jumped, and he turned his back
242 toward the entrance to the dragon's grotto, hunching forward to protect himself
243 from the flames. His body seared with pain, his clothes and skin crackled with
244 every movement. His hair stank, and his vision was blurred from the heat.
245 
246 Despite his agony, his mind worked quickly. He protected every bare spot of
247 skin. He held his sword horizontally, sticking out into the tunnel. His buried
248 his face in his arms.
249 
250 And the fire came.
251 
252 The force was even greater than the last. It swept by him, shoving him into the
253 wall. His sword again grew hot, and glowed red. But the Bear was more protected
254 this time. Even though the heat hurt like never before- like a raw burn held 
255 under boiling water- he coiled his legs underneath him, and worked his hands
256 quickly. Soon the sword was too hot to hold, and he dropped it. It fell with a
257 loud clang! And soon the fire subsided. 
258 As soon as the flames died, the Bear jumped from his crouched position, and
259 looked toward the small opening beyond while he unraveled a thin cord from his
260 hands. He bent down quickly and grabbed a small stone from the ground.
261 
262 And then the inevitable eye came. It's original green was gone. It gleamed red
263 like the gates of hell. Anger, hunger, and an evil determination to kill like
264 the Bear had never seen seemed to jump  from its look. And it saw Bear standing
265 in the tunnel. Standing defiant and proud, sword at his feet, a small rope 
266 dangling from his hand. The eyelids folded back, and the dragon roared with
267 rage.
268 
269 Before the dragon of Fendarr pulled back its head for another mighty blow, the
270 Bear swung his sling 'round his head three times. The stone lay in the middle
271 of the rope. He hurled the stone as fiercely as he could, ignoring the scream-
272 ing of his muscles. The rock flew through the air toward the end of the
273 tunnel.
274 
275 It landed directly in the dragon's eye with a loud 'squish!', quickly followed
276 by a tremendous scream that knocked Bear off his feet. He quickly righted him-
277 self, and dashed, and then crawled, toward the entrance to the grotto where the
278 dragon of Fendarr shrieked in pain and surprise, thrashing its body and 
279 gigantic tail all around the huge room...

286      In defense of lefties, a service station attendant once told me that
287 all left-handed people are geniuses.... of course he was left-handed.  Now,
288 I wouldn't go that far, but reflect on the lefties you know.... they're all
289 a little different, right?  Well, maybe a lot different.  But if you had to
290 cope in a world set up for right handers, you might be different too.
291 Scissors that don't fit your hand, notebooks with the little wire thingies
292 on the wrong side, and even in grade school... desks built only for writing
293 with the right hand.  With all those obstacles, lefties are forces to 
294 become a little more resourceful than the normal human being.
295      As for the self-love crack, I must protest.  Honest, when I lock myself
296 in the bathroom, I'm only meditating.

356 Emu: It's "torture", a "torcher" is someone who uses a torch.... Of course
357 you could use a torcher to torture (yech!)

360      "You ARE here, yes.  And I am joyful at your presence.  Thank the
361 StarGods that I have the privelidge to be here at the Inn."
362      Sending is confusing, and I haven't quite gotten the hang of it, and so my
363 little message didn't exactly come out quite right....or so I gathered by the puzzled look of the elven mystic.
364      "Er...Zephyr...." and he repeated the "lost inn the translation" message.
365      "You...here,-es.  Am thank-"
366      Whoops.
367      Sometimes even the most ambitious attempts can foul up.  Murphy's Law:
368 Anything that can go wrong will probably do so if it finds that it will cause
369 you considerable embarrasment.
370      "Forgive me, Dreamtoucher..I-"
371      .....and I sensed it again.  A presence.  Whirling about above my head
372 ...yet not there at all.  Sight, smell,
373 and all my senses saidt otherwise, but the fact remained that there was some
374 other *PERSON* here besides Dreamtoucher
375 and his wolfian companion!

377 Frank, oh Frank why don't you come out of hiding and set the story straight. Tell us all how as a little test in
378 humanity you threw at the good users of Backwater the most perverse biographies ever told. Relate those details,
379 those juicy details of what you did and how you did it and who you did it with. Perhaps you expected compassion
380 for your problems? Instead you got offers of free surgery, without the added cost of anesthesia. Everyone was
381 so willing to help you solve your little problems, of course what they thought as help you might think of as
382 something entirely different. Frank, your messages caused us all to think a bit and examine our own morals. A
383 sense of introspection swept over the system as you continued to provoke attacks with your continual defense of
384 your particular perversions. Then suddenly you went away, but not before you took a parting shot at all the
385 people who reacted with such violence towards your leanings. One last parting shot, not unlike that famous
386 sportscaster who never played the game. Everyone deserved it. Hardly a person understood what you were trying
387 to do. No, you did more than try, you succeeded. You managed to lift the facade that we all wear and expose
388 our true feelings on a very delicate subject. You did something that all the wit and story and conversation that
389 had gone on before failed to accomplish. Congratulations Frank. You did well, but people forget. Maybe it is
390 time to remind them.

392 FYI

394 Hey thar Emu, don't let these nit-picks get you down. Leonard is just jealous
395 he didn't think of torching someone first. Remember, those who protest too
396 much often find great solace in the missteps of others.

407 I wish none of this had happened.  Through my unbridled anger 
408 and my own stupidity I've lost the best friend I have.  Maybe 
409 I was wrong, maybe I shouldn't have said anything.  But it is 
410 too late now.  Now I can only wonder at the results of my 
411 foolish actions.  All of the happy times destroyed.  Is there 
412 nothing left my friend?  Is this the end?  To be left alone 
413 with only the ring of my own anguished screem echoing in my 
414 ears?  The house is empty, and even the carpet doesn't muffle 
415 the sound of my ploding step.  The walls only stare back at me 
416 in their indifference.  I wish I could reverse time, to undo 
417 the damage.  Where are you my friend, where have you gone?

422    The young man sat motionless on the straw mat, staring into
423 
424 space, staring into the past. Across the stone floor a rat glared
425 
426 at him, baleful,red eyed,unseen. And the hours passed. Dawn.
427 
428    The stillness is punctuated by the shrill cry of Bluejays, and far
429 
430 away, the laughter of children at play.
431 
432    The young man hears not the sounds drifting through the barred
433 
434 window high above him. So deep is his reverie that he feels neither the
435 
436 welts on his back or the shackles upon his feet.
437 
438    How did you know?...
439 
440 In the blackness that surrounds him, he sees not the distant mountains 
441 
442 shining blue as the Arian sun melts their winter coat... the Crocuses
443 
444 dotting the fields with splashes of purple and gold. 
445 
446    Far beyond the despair that tears at every fiber of his being is the
447 
448 promise of new life,beyond his knowing was the dream of the people
449 
450 his people. For them, there would be no new life. He had failed. 
451 
452    The young man shuddered inside as the memories flooded his mind again
453 
454 and again, from the time his father had given him the map, and then
455 
456 gone away again, the village elders, and their teachings, the ring
457 
458 they had given him, and the long journey to the mountains, the 
459 
460 pasageway to the valley beyond, and the secret of the Vernal Equinox.
461 
462    Tears welled up in his eyes as he remembered his companion who had drowned
463 
464 and the mysterious rescue from the storm...
465 
466    Why would they not believe him?...
467 
468 The crash of a door thrown open brought him back
469 
470 and the young man was once again filled with fear. What would they do to him thi
471 
472    There must be a way to escape...

484   The piper sat, back to the wall next to the door opening, holding his torn-
485 open wound, stauching the blood with direct pressure.  As the group around
486 Trainor began their psychic surgery, the silence was broken only by the 
487 thick sound of half-congealed blood dropping and staining the richly inlaid
488 floor of the corridor.  The pain and loss of blood had weakened him, leaving
489 him light-headed and filled with lassitude.  He relaxed and watched the scene
490 with half-lidded eyes.
491   Life has shown that a dimunition of physical prowess sometimes leads to 
492 the sharpening of the non-physical senses.  Many of the noted psycic exp-
493 lorers have been frail or physically ill -- as though the mind compensates
494 for the bodily weakness and becomes pernaturally sensitive.  Feeling, at
495 once, separate from and an integral part of the unfolding scene, the piper
496 watched the unfolding drama in front of him, a silent spectator at a living
497 play, a voiceless critic at the drama of life.

509 To amplify the amplification on the wasted space... not only did you waste all
510 sorts of space with the double spacing, but your writing style is full of fancy
511 words and style, and little substance. Which often seems to be the case with
512 people who are trying to cover up the fact that they are saying nothing.
513 
514 Bluster 'em with b.s. as they say. Oh, and one more, double extra space was
515 wasted because of goofballs like me and the folks above who then have to com-

521 Stupidity no. 324: People who put down Commodore. Hey, they're cheap, they can

524 mouths are stuffed with Big Macs.
525 Hey, it may not be gourmet... but they have their place!

527 So why don't you let those poor folks who can't fork out $5,000 for a little
528 quicker machine enjoy theirs! Volkswagens, McDonalds, K-Mart, Commodore---
529 they all make more money than anyone else because they fill a *need*. Besides,

537 One more on the lefty question:
538 I was the one who made the crazy comments about lefties being rapists, etc.
539 Why? No, I'm not dumb enough to believe it, but it was simply to illustrate
540 how one insane voice gets heard over and over again by the people who shout
541 their objections... despite the obvious insanity in the original comment!
542 
543 I once entered a matchmaker BBS, you know, the X-rated kind people use for 2
544 weeks and then get bored with. Anyway, I made some public comment that all
545 homosexuals should be shot, etc. The result was that a bored, very few 
546 messages left system was suddenly flooded with comments... adding a great deal
547 of publicity to the original comments!
548 
549 The same goes for those stupid BBS busters- as soon as they do their thing
550 everyone writes about it and they get all the attention they crave!
551 
552 And how 'bout the KKK, white supremecy groups, terrorists,  etc. If we, and
553 especially the media, but people as a whole ignore such infantile attention-
554 getters, wouldn't that take all the wind out of their sails?
555 
556 So next time, remember. When an idiotic, short-sighted, prejudicial comment is
557 made... just ignore it! The commenter will be so blustered he/she will rarely 
558 try it again!

606 To person above talking about publicity. Yes, that is very true,
607 the current problem of that sort is with the AIDS thing. The hystaria
608 that is going on about that is largely the result of a very irresponisble
609 media. They are simply unwilling to talk about the real problem. They
610 are looking so despiritly for the cause of the problem other than the
611 real one that exists. To put it in perpective, The chances over your life
612 of being struck by lightning are 100,000 to 1 the chance of contacting
613 AIDS is 1 million to 1. And if you understand the aspect of AIDS, for
614 most people it is even less of a chance. The reason why is that AIDS
615 simply cannot exist outside of the body fluids (blood) it self destructs.
616 A cover story on the lastest Discover magazine says it very well,
617 AIDS is the fatal risk of anal intercourse. The story goes on to reasonably
618 coverage of the subject at hand. If your interested in the subject, 
619 it might be worthwhile picking up a copy.
620 """"""""""""""""""""""""""" fred """""""""""""""""""""""""""""
621 The thing with AIDS tho, is that the numbers are growing, and are perhaps larger
622 than your figures would indicate. If as many people were hit by lightning as
623 are now contacting AIDS, the numbers growing at the same rate, you can bet your
624 buns there'd be all sorts of hype of that as well.
625 But take note... first VD... naw, that won't stop our fornication. Okay, how 
626 about something permanent? Herpes! That oughta stop 'em. No, I like my lust too
627 much... it's worth the risk.
628 Okay fine... how 'bout risk of death! Well....
