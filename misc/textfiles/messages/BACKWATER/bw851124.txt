5 GENERAL DISCLAIMER: BWMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION
6                     PLACED ON THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be
12 periodically purged of messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
13 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out of the
14 ENTER mode. The message is automatically stored. If after entering the
15 message you find you made a mistake, use the replace command to replace
16 the line. To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
17 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.

20 *********************************************************************
21 Kristi:    It was passed on to me that you had entered a message here 
22 and that it disappeared, and that you thought that maybe I had erased
23 it for some reason. Fear not! it was not me. You are more than welcome 
24 here! There are a number of possiblities as to what might have happened.
25 So, I'll pass on some hints about catches and just plain weird things
26 about the system here.
27 First, as you've found out, the spaces in the commands are important.
28 When you are entering, always finish each line with a carriage return.
29 To get out of the enter mode, do a control C. If you do a control C
30 in the middle of a line (before the carraige return) the line will be
31 thrown away. So always do the CR, then the control C (unless you don't
32 want the line to be stored). 
33 There is a bug in the FI and FA commands such that if a line has exactly 
34 128 characters in it, the FI and FA commands will always show the lines
35 with 128 characters in them. Thus try not to use 128 margins. (Anything 
36 less is fine.) The FI command always starts at line one. To find the 
37 next occurance after it stops, type the command EXACTLY as you did 
38 before. If you type something else it will start all over again at the
39 top of the disk. And of course, turn the line numbers on first so that
40 you will know where the line is. Because of the problem, most people use
41 the FA command. 
42 One other bug is that if you enter the very last message on the disk, 
43 (the system responds with *File full* and dumps you back to the command
44 prompt > ) you MUST type OFF or the message will not be saved. 
45 It is a good idea to get in the habit of typing OFF before you leave just
46 to be sure. 
47 Don't hangup in the middle of a message, or it will be lost. Do a 
48 conntrol C first so that you are back to the command prompt. There is 
49 no BYE command like on other systems, so just type OFF, and hangup.
50 Finally, sometimes I leave the system in all allowed (as opposed to 
51 enter only), usually as a result of forgeting to put it in enter only 
52 after putting in a new disk. The reason for enter only is because there
53 are some out there who are destructive, or just don't care about other
54 people, and vandlise the entries left. So if you see something disapear
55 during all allowed, don't be surprised. If it disapears during enter only,
56 it was me. I have not deleted nor modified anything you have put on here 
57 to date, so don't worry in that regard. 
58 
59 Hope this helps, have fun, enjoy the system, and I'll look forward to
60 your entries!

94 					The Chase
95 
96 	The moon peered suddenly from behind a cloud, casting eerie shadows on
97 the ground below. A moonless night, the weatherman had said. So much for his
98 'predicted forecase.' The house on the hill loomed over the surrounding
99 countryside like a vigilant guard, seemingly aware of everything. Nothing
100 escaped its view, there was no safe hidden approach. Why does the moon have to
101 be out tonight? At least the cover of darkness would offer some concealment.
102 But no! If I didn't have bad luck I'd have no luck at all. So the song goes.
103 Gawd I hate country music.
104 
105 	A tightened cloak and a quicker pace add little solace to the
106 journey up the hill, to the house, and what lay inside. It all started on a
107 harmless dare. I'll bet you ANYTHING you can't go up to the Gould House on
108 the hill and stay the night. You are TOO chicken. Squak! Squak! Squak!
109 Children can be so cruel, especially when they are 18 years old. So it's off
110 to see the Goulds, and come what may, try to collect on a dare.
111 
112 	The old Gould House had been abondoned many years ago. No one lived
113 there, but who can say for sure about the spirits that remained. It was
114 a constant source of ghost story material, never an overnight stay at a
115 friend's house went by without at least one tale of horror centering on the
116 local spook central. Childhoods went by, and still the house remained, a silent
117 sentinel overlooking the town, offering nothing but scares to children and
118 worried looks to parents. What if my little Johnny should decide to visit the
119 house by himself one night? It should be torn down. That would be the end of
120 it! But the house remains, as does the talk. Sure it's an eyesore, but don't
121 ask ME to put up the money for its demolition.

145          "Well?"
146          "It's true, they have it."
147          "And?"
148 
         "And we've got to recover it, soon."
149          "Yes...how then?"
150          "I think we'll have to call on mercenaries."
151          "What's wrong with one of the guards?"
152          "Well, I don't think they can do it."
153          "Umm...which one then?"
154          "A group.  Headed by Mitch Ryder."
155          "Talis-men?"
156          "Yes."
157 
         "Brock!  Bring me the Net!  I hope your right."
158          "So do I."
159  
160          "Three...two...one...now!" and a destroying beam of light shot
161          from the point of the "Turnstyle", ruining the boulder that acted
162          as a target.  There was nothing like filling time with some
163          practice, and Mitch never got enough.
164                   Recently, he had been actually missing some of his
165          stationary targets.  So he had ordered his group to drill and
166          drill, so as to make sure that this laxity did not catch; they
167          couldn't afford it.
168                   And the Net reciever buzzed in it's high-tune to let
169          him know that someone had something to say.
170                   "Mitch?" came the voice of the radio operator, Lok,
171          back at base,"There's a call for you on two-nine-one-point-four
172          from a Mr. Enas of Enas Gallary.  He says it's vital."
173                   "Okay, patch him through."  An audible click and the
174          open ambience.  A voice, powerfull, filled the cockpit of his
175          ship.
176                   "Mr. Ryder?  Mitch Ryder?"
177                   "Yes.  Who is this?"
178 
                  "My name is Gallen Enas, President of Enas Gallary.
179           We want to hire your services."
180                   Good.  "What for?" still calm and collected.
181                   "There has been a robbery, a robbery of our most valued
182           piece."
183                   "What piece?  And why not take this to Imperial Patrol?"
184                   "The Star of Elsior has been stolen, and the Imperial
185           Patrol have no juristiction where it has been taken."
186                   Ummm.  "Where, has it been taken?"
187                   "Ursa Minor, third belt."
188                   Great.  The third belt of Ursa Minor, only the hottest
189           spot for an outworlder.  "How much?"
190                   "Your standard fee."
191                   "No chance."
192                   "Twice your standard fee."
193                   Chance.  Hmmm.  "We would want the money ahead of time,
194           plus coverage for needed special equipment."
195                   "How soon do you want it?"
196 
                  He reached.  "Today."
197                   "It shall be done.  Report here for more information."
198 
                  Mitch switched off the Net.  This looked good.  A few
199           dead outworlders, and a priceless piece returned to a stuffy art
200           gallary.  Mitch dipped low and took-out a second boulder.

210 [*=*] I'd like to rent a safe deposit box, please.    The young woman with
211 the long blonde hair looked up to see a powerfully built man looking at her. "Oh, yes, sir, uh, what
212 size did you want, we have..." The man interrupted her. "I'd like to have a look at the vault, I can
213 decide there". It was not a question, and the girl got up from her desk. " Please come with me..."
214    Delta Five looked around quickly, and found what he had come for. It was a small size box, as he
215 had expected. He then selected a larger box, a few rows below. "I think this size, is this one rented?"
216 The blonde woman looked at him inquisitively, perhaps sensing something. Well, yes, you may rentis
217 one..."Delta followed her back to her desk, where the necessary papers were signed. He paid cash, as
218 he always did. The woman loked at him again, puzzeled, and said "did you want to use the box now?" 
219 "yes, I'd like to". "I can find the way back" He enered the vault, and working with the speed of ex-
220 perience, and of near desperation, he removed from under his jacket, a steel plate six inches square.
221 Through the plate, were two steel pins,set in snug fitting bushings. One was fixed in place, and te
222 other could be moved back and forth in a slot. At each end were small magnets. Quickly, he made a 
223 few mental calculations, and just then, the blonde woman entered the vault, carrying a ring of keys.
224 "Sir, It takes two keys..." Delta feigned ignorance and stood there, waiting. "Oh, yes, of course"
225 The box was opened, and the woman started to leave. "Will you need a booth?" "SIR. Will you need a
226 private booth---" "Delta scowled at her. "No, that won't be necessary" His tone implied that he wanted
227 
228 to be left alone, and the woman returned to her desk. Now. He placed the plate on the small box so 
229 that one of the pins was directly over one lock, an moved the second pin over the other lock. Reaching
230 into his pocket, he took out a fistful of the old coins he had bought, and laid them in the box that
231 he had just rented. Pulling that box out so that it was about to fall, he removed the hammer from 
232 his belt, and using it endwise, smashed the head aginst the two pins. Both locks were ripped from the
233 door of the box. As he stuffed the hammer back in
234 his belt, he pulled the newly rented box the rest of the way out, and it crashed to the floor. Every
235 second counted now. He opened the door of the littl box, and removed the contents-a large manila n
236 velope folded in thirds, and placed it in an inside jacket pocket. Then he closed the smaller box, 
237 and, cursing, dropped to his knees, and started to pick up the coins that were all over the floor.
238 The blonde woman hurried into the vault-"what is going on here, what was that noise..." Delta cut 
239 her off. "I dropped the damned box, if it's any of your business..." "Listen, I work here, and any
240 thing that happens here IS my business", she retorted. "Well, I dropped the damn box, like I said. 
241 He had finished picking up the coins. "Will you please lock this thing now?" The woman complied. 
242 Delta looked at her, and his features softened a little..."I'm sorry, miss, these coins belonged to
243 my son. He was killed in a motorcycle accident last week, and I've,..I'm just..." The woman looked
244 at the floor, ashamed. "I'm sorry, Sir, Please forgive me..."I guess I'd better go", and then he was
245 gone. As was the contents of a safe deposit box rented by two men who had once been his friends, then
246 his enemies, and who were now dead. Delta Five was on his way to Switzerland...
247 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
248 Bear walked for what seemed like hours. He was tired and hungry, and unnerved
249 by the silent marchers around him. His thoughts wandered to better times,
250 worlds with sun... light, wind, his Ladyship-- suddenly he was shaken from
251 his thoughts with a yank on the ropes which bound his hands. He had no time to
252 look about him, but found himself hurled into a small room. He landed with a
253 thud against the far wall, and the door slammed shut behind him.
254 
255 Complete darkness. Complete silence.
256 
257 He lay in the room for a moment, and then began working his hands free from
258 the rope. He was loose in short order, having pulled at them during the
259 entire journey. His eyes were adjusting as much as possible, but where there
260 was no light, little vision could be had. His hands searched the room, noting
261 its size, the height of its ceiling.
262 
263 It all appeared to made of soft clay, save the door. He felt the ceiling
264 again. The clay crumbled around his hands as he touched it. In a primitive
265 frenzy, he began gouging the soft material. For no special reason he could
266 think of, he dug upwards with his strong hands. The ceiling was low, so at 
267 first he could dig flatfooted. Up he clawed, until he was reaching on his
268 tiptoes.
269 
270 He gave one final reach with his hand, and just then, felt something solid
271 touch his finger. Puzzled, he swiped at it again, ignoring the falling clay
272 around him and on his face. Again, something hard. Wooden perhaps. He reached 
273 up with all his height, and clawed with a frenzy...
274 
275 00000000000000000000000 THE BEAR 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
276 
277 ...It was a quiet night at the Inn. The patrons sat at their cozy tables,
278 speaking in hushed whispers. The cold wind rattled the huge doors, the fire
279 crackled, and the bartender wiped some glasses dry. An odd feeling came over 
280 him despite the apparent calmness. He couldn't quite put a finger on it---
281 
282 There was a faint sound underneath the floor in front of the bar. Damn! Rats
283 again! he thought. He peered over the edge of the bar to get a better look.
284 
285 The beer glass fell with a loud crash, everyone in the Inn gave the barkeeper
286 a startled look. But his own face was even more startled. "Look!" was all he
287 could cry, pointing at the wooden floor in front of him.
288 
289 Everyone looked down at the floor. An audible gasp could be heard from the
290 entire group.
291 
292 One of the floorboards was shaking, rising up from its mooring. Underneath,
293 on one side, poked a small, round, dirty thing, not unlike a worm. The board
294 shook some more, and then creaked against the strain of the nails holding
295 it. With a sudden crash and a flying of dirt and dust, the board flew from the
296 floor and landed about six feet away. Another board screamed, and flew in
297 the opposite direction.
298 
299 The patrons could only stare in amazement. Hands poked through the ever-widen-
300 ing hole, and two more boards flew into the air. In the hole was complete
301 darkness.
302 
303 The hands grasped either edge, and a grunt was heard.
304 
305 A filthy, sweaty, squinting face peered out of the hole. Then an entire body,
306 lifted up by his hands on either side. The man lifted himself up, and sat on
307 one side of the hole. He wiped his forehead and squinted around himself.
308 
309 "Where the hell am I?" he asked suddenly.
310 The barkeep could only shake his head.  "Backwater Inn. But who the hell are
311 you?"
312 
313 Before he could finish the question the man grinned a huge grinned and
314 looked around like a young boy who had been promised an entire candy store.
315 "My name is Bear. And I'll be a pigeon's butt if I haven't found what I've
316 been lookin' for."
317 
318 The Bear just sat there and grinned at everybody. "Give me a beer, bartender.
319 And, uh, you got a phone anywhere?"
320 
321 000000000000000000000000 THE BEAR 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
322 
323 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
324  
325      The glowing sphere quivered in his hands, engulfing them with tenta-
326 cles of an eerie light. Betraying no emotion he slowly, ever so slowly 
327    set them on the oaken table in front of him. Seeing it "slither" onto 
328 the the tabletop, yielded it a slight smile, which was quickly wiped off
329 
    frowned sharply,  it shrank, gripping the table and mentally squealing.
330   Sensing it's pain he offered it a tear,  changing it to a cheery hue of 
331  purple. 
332                  
333        An involuntary grin crashed through his teeth an threw itself 
334   at his lips.  Instantly the thing grew twice its original size, now 
335    a  happy  blue.  a  giggle kicked his  mouth,  muscles  erupted along   
336  it's  tentacles length.  Fingers grew through it's stub,  growing  long 
337 razor  sharp  nails.  White,  pointed teeth ripped out it's  previously 
338 oothless mouth. It began to pulse black.
339        
340    He felt it sinking it's newly found fangs into his soft skin. Pain
341  shot through his body,  enveloping every nerve,  every precious part of 
342   his  whole,  soul and all.  He laughed like a madman,  remembering  his 
343  little  3 year old brother falling to the bloodied ground  after  being 
344 it by a cadillac, black cadillac. He laughed as his whole was slowly, 
345    painfully sucked from beneath him.  
346   
347    Then he was no more.
348       
349

                    Computer Etiquette, By Mel North
368 
                    ________________________________
369 
        The following are a few points of general BBS etiquette. If you
370 
    wish to maintain your welcome on whatever system you happen to call,
371 
    it w be to your advantage to observe these few rules. (Sysops -
372 
    feel free to download this & display it on your BBS)
373 
        1.  Don't habitually hang up on a system. Every Sysop is aware
374 
    that accidental disconnections happen once in a while but we do tend
375 
    to get annoyed with people who hang up every single time they call
376 
    because they are either too lazy to terminate properly or they labor
377 
    under the mistaken assumption that the 10 seconds they save online
378 
    is going to nificantly alter their phone bill.  "Call Waiting" is
379 
    not an acceptable excuse for long. If you have it and intend to use
380 
    the line to call BBS systems, you should either have it disconnected
381 
    or find some other way to circumvent it.  
382 
        2.  Don't do dumb things like leave yourself a message that says 
383 
    "Just testing to see if this thing works". Where do you think all 
384 
    those other messages came from if it didn't work? Also, don't leave 
385 
    whiney messages that say "Please leave me a mess-age". If ever there
386 
    was a person to ignore, it's the one who begs someone to leave him a
387 
    message.  If you want to get messages, start by reading the ones
388 
    that are already online and getting involved in the conversations
389 
    that exist.
390 
        3.  Don't use the local equivalent of a chat command unless you
391 
    really have some clear cut notion of what you want to say and why.
392 
    almost any Sysop is more than happy to answer questions or offer
393 
    help concerning his system. Unfortunately, because about 85% of the
394 
    people who call want to chat and about 99% of those people have
395 
    absolutely nothing to say besides "How old are you?" or something
396 
    equally irrelevent, fewer Sysops even bother answering their pagers
397 
    every day.
398 
        4.  When you are offered a place to leave comments when exiting
399 
    a system, don't try to use this area to ask the Sysop questions. It
400 
    is very rude to the other callers to expect the Sysop to carry on a
401 
    half visible conversation with someone. If you have a question or
402 
    statement to make and expect the Sysop to respond to it, it should
403 
    always be made in the section where all the other messages are kept.
404 
    This allows the Sysop to help many people with the same problem with
405 
    the least amount of effort on his part.
406 
        5.  Before you log on with your favorite psuedonym, make sure
407 
    that handles are allowed. Most Sysops don't want people using
408 
    handles on the system. There is not enough room for them, they get
409 
    silly games of one-upmanship started, it is much nicer to deal with
410 
    a person on a personal basis, and last but not least, everyone
411 
    should be willing to take full responsibility for his actions or
412 
    comments instead of slinging mud from behind a phoney name.
413 
        Also when signing on, why not sign on just like you would
414 
    introduce yourself in your own society? How many of you usually 
415 
    introduce yourselves as Joe W Smutz the 3rd or 4th?
416 
        6.  Take the time to log on properly. There is no such place as
417 
    RIV, HB, ANA or any of a thousand other abbreviations people use
418 
    instead of their proper city.  You may think that everyone knows
419 
    what RIV is supposed to mean, but every BBS has people calling from
420 
    all around the country and I assure you that someone from Podunk,
421 
    Iowa has no idea what you're talking about.
422 
      .  Don't go out of your way to make rude observations like
423 
    "Gee, this system is slow". Every BBS is a tradeoff of features. You
424 
    can generally assume that if someone is running a particular brand
425 
    of software, that he is either happy with it or he'll decide to find
426 
    another system he likes better. It does nobody any good when you
427 
    make comments about something that you perceive to be a flaw when it
428 
    is running the way the Sysop wants it to. Constructive criticism is
429 
    somewhat more welcome. If you have an alternative method that seems
430 
    to make good sense then run it up the flagpole.
431 
        8.  When leaving messages, stop and ask yourself whether it is
432 
    necessary to make it private. Unless there is some particular reason
433 
    that everyone shouldn't know what you're saying, don't make it 
434 
    private.  We don't call them PUBLIC bulletin boards for nothing, 
435 
    folks. It's very irritating to other callers when there are huge 
436 
    blank spots in the messages that they can't read and it stifles 
437 
    interaction between callers.  
438 
        9.  If your favorite BBS has a time limit, observe it. If it 
439 
    doesn't, set a limit for yourself and abide by it instead. Don't tie 
440 
    up a system untitem as a new user and run right to the other numbers 
441 
    list.  There is probably very little that's more annoying to any 
442 
    Sysop than to have his board completely passed over by you on your 
443 
    way to another board.  
444 
        11.  Have the common courtesy to pay attention to what passes in 
445 
    front of your face. When a BBS displays your name and asks "Is this 
446 
    you?", don't say yes when you can see perfectly well that it is 
447 
    mispelled. Also, don't start asking questions about simple operation 
448 
    of a system until you have thouroghly read all of the instructions 
449 
    that are available to you. I assure you that it isn't any fun to 
450 
    answer a question for the thousandth time when the answer is 
451 
    pnently displayed in the system bulletins or instructions. Use 
452 
    some common sense when you ask your questions. The person who said 
453 
    "There's no such thing as a stupid question" obviously never
454 
    operated a BBS.  
455 
        12. Don't be personally abusive. It doesn't matter whether you 
456 
    like a Sysop or think he's a jerk. The fact remains that he has a 
457 
    large investment in making his computer available, usually out of 
458 
    the goodness of his heart. If you don't like a Sysop or his system, 
459 
    just remember that you can change the channel any time you want. 
460 
    Besides, whether you are aware of it or not, if you make yourself 
461 
    enough of an annoyance to any Sysop, he can take the time to trace 
462 
    you down and make your life, or that of your parents, miserable.  
463 
        13. Keep firmly in mind that you are a guest on any BBS you 
464 
    happen to call.  Don't think of logging on as one of your basic 
465 
    human rights.  Every person that has ever put a computer system 
466 
    online for the use of other people has spent a lot of time and money 
467 
    to do so. While he doesn't expect nonstop pats on the back, it seems 
468 
    reasonable that he should at least be able to expect fair treatment 
469 
    from his callers. This includes following any of the rules for 
470 
    system use he has laid out without grumping about it. Every Sysop 
471 
    has his own idea of how he wants his system to be run. It is really 
472 
    none of your business why he wants to run it the way he does. Your 
473 
    business is to either abide by what he says, or call some other BBS 
474 
    where you feel that you can obey the rules.
475 

476   Try this rad new BBS, White Plum Mountain at
477 246-8617. It's more than just a boaring old BBS.
478 Check it out and see, or miss out on the fun!!

485 To whoever got that from BIX and put it here:  It's really out of place.  It's
486 all very good advice, I can tell you from experience it's correct, but it
487 really belongs elsewhere.  Also, it used up so many uneccesary lines.

495 White Plum Mountain? Oh well... PEN NAME is right, in my unasked opinion.
496 [*=*] I have been saving all McKane entries starting 22 Nov. If anyone
497 is interested in a hardcopy, I'll supply the disk if you have a line
498 printer, please advise. Delta Five.
499 ??????? Dorun Rubicon.
500 Lurking, lurking, oh such fun...  SOLI...
501 Pen Name: If by 'extra spaces' you meant the 'blank lines' in your upload
502 what is happening is that you are sending linefeed characters which are 
503 getting stored & redisplayed to you. The person who uploaded that stuff
504 from BIX was doing a straight 'dump' of what he downloaded as he was 
505 sending lf's too! (this is something that the 'old-timers' here know &
506 hate! If someone is going to expect us to read something he uploaded, the
507 least he can do is edit it (remove the lf's, perhaps change the margins, 
508 etc))
509 ALL: there are *three* different ways of getting a successful upload to 
510 BWMS. As far as I know, these are the *only* ways to do it!
511 1. Send a character, wait for BW to echo it back, send the next character
512    (I can provide a simple BASIC program to do this if you can't figure
513     it out yourself)
514 2. Send a character, wait, send next character (amount of delay varies
515    with computer and other conditions)
516 3. use a program (like Compuserve's VIDTEX) that has 'prompted upload'
517    & supply the prompt char yourself (ie. tell to do a prompted upload
518    with say, ":" as the prompt char, then after it sends the first line
519    *you* type the ":" and it will (usually) send the next line). This
520    works best if you pick a character that isn't in your file. And you
521    will be stuck with having all the lines from #2 on starting with
522    that char.

537     "Yes, the packets have been delivered. My schedule for tomorrow has been
538 set with individual interviews as we discussed. Each agent is being alloted
539 25 minutes in which to speak his mind regarding the changes."
540     "What were the reactions of agents Fellows and Parity?"
541     "Reserved and without emotion. They exhibit their NET training constantly.
542 I could get no response out of them after I had handed them their packet. I
543 expect them to be much more talkative tomorrow afternoon."
544     "Good. All our plans our proceeding on course and without delay. Send
545 Fellows and Parity to level thirteen after their apointments. We wish to
546 speak to them directly."
547     "Ah, as you wish. May I ask the nature of these personal interviews?"

571 a campaign to fight measured phone service, I will get you the phone number or someone to get in contact with, in a
