29    The Inn.
30    James sat at the scarred wooden table, a mug of ale before him. It was the same table he had sat at when this whole
31 fiasco began. He looked across at the empty chair and then closed his eyes, wishing. But when he opened them, the
32 chair was still empty. She was still in her bed on a planet a thousand parsecs away. By now she had given him up for
33 dead. He should have taken the bargain. Now it was too late, and he had nothing left.
34    Nothing. Even his power was waning rapidly. The wounds he had aquired on Kadan would not heal completely and every
35 breath racked him with pain. His belly was a cold ball of lead and the thought of eating made him want to retch.
36 Still, he managed a composed outward appearance to the patrons around him, who ignored him just as intently as he
37 ignored them. None of them knew, and he was sure they wouldn't have cared if they did. It's a tough old world out
38 there, an if you didn't take care of yourself, nobody would.
39    He did have something: his memories. He closed his eyes again. A moment later he opened them when something soft
40 brushed his hand. He looked down at a large grey and white rabbit, who was looking back up at him with big, soulful
41 eyes. Somehow the animal must have sensed his pain and came over to him. Whether that was the case or not, James felt
42 touched.
43    He stroked the rabbit's soft fur gently. "Hey, there, fellah. It's nice to have one friend, even if he is fuzzy."
44 Damned if the rabbit didn't almost seem to understand. His hand encountered something around the rabbit's neck. It was
45 a small shoulder pouch. What was a rabbit doing with a handbag? Around this place, nothing surprised him.
46    Who cares, anyway. Sinking back into his melancholy, he let his chin drop to the table while he continued petting
47 the rabbit. "Zephyr." he mumbled. The rabbit's ears went up instantly. Not noticing, James mumbled, "You haven't heard
48 of someone called Zephyr, have you?"
49    Of course he wasn't serious. First off, he had already talked to the man at the bar, who was subbing for he
50 innkeeper while the innkeeper was doing something, and he didn't know nothing. And the other people were either
51 uncommunicatice or sometimes downright hostile. The hostile ones remembered him from last time. And in the second
52 place, the rabbit wasn't going to speak up and answer him. Still, something had agitated it.
53    "S'matter, guy? Calm down. That asshole with the shotgun isn't coming back, you know." The rabbit wouldn't calm
54 down, though. It kept pawing him, like it had something to say.
55    "What, you want a carrot or something?" Frustrated, the animal finally sank its teeth into his hand, in the
56 sentitive webbing between the thumb and forfinger. James jumped up immediately, knocking over his chair and bellowing,
57 "JESUS %$!#'@& CHRIST!" Surprise, anger and pain had momentarily boosted his power enough that the sword appeared in
58 his hands almost unbidden. he raised it high over his head and roared, "I'm gonna make hasenpfeffer outa you!"
59    But before he did, he listened. A tense hush had come over the crowd around him. Everybody was staring, and a
60 couple were half out of their chairs, hands on their weapons. They were waiting for him. Then he looked down at the
61 rabbit, which was cowering against the far end of the table in danger of falling off. What was he doing? Slowly he
62 lowered he blade and released it. Nobody relaxed, though. To him it seemed as if they were daring him to try
63 something. Go ahead, make our day. He wanted to scream at them, tell them how worthless this all was. They imagined
64 they could defeat anybody, but somewhere out there God or some cosmic practical joker would lay them low just as He
65 did him. It was inevitable.
66    Instead he just turned around and left.
67    Outside, he had to struggle to keep from crying. It took a long moment, but he finally suceeded. Summoning the
68 sword again, he opened a warpgate (His ship had been lost in the accident on Amphyrian). he didn't know where the
69 'gate led, except it was a habitable planet. He was going to lose himself, and deny history the chance to confirm his
70 demise. At least the Destroyer will live on in the imaginations of some.
71    He stepped through the shimmering oval and it collapsed behind him with a bang.

90    hello,
91 My name is Amy Daniels I just started using a modem . The reason I got a
92 modem was to met other people.  So I
93 thought I ould leave my number for anyone wo wanted to talk to me .  I love
94 to talk to people so If you want just call and ask for amy after about 5 
95 p.m. since I usualy have before then along with school.  my number is 
96 XXX-XXXX .thanks

103   Don't change your boarder, it's a nice one.  They might remember who else
104 might have used it in the past but they don't seem to mind.  As for a alias
105 I don't know, what's wrong with the last one?
106   Anyway, getting into the story line here might be fun.  Even if it takes
107 a while to figure out what is going on.
108 
109   This board IS for people who like to write.  The board should have enough
110 space for those people, not just one.  A HUGE entry takes up space and time
111 from all of the other people who want to write.  Such a big entry will also
112 discourage new people from writting, they wouldn't know if it was 'okay' to
113 enter anything from a new user.
114   The story is good, but far to long for a board like this.  Users need an
115 equal share of the 629 lines.

118 A GOOD POINT MENTIONED ABOVE. SILVERMAN, IN HIS TWO CHARACTERS, HAS TAKEN
119 TWENTY PERCENT OF THE BOARD. THAT'S ONE FIFTH, WITH THE REST FOR THE OTHER
120 POOR UNDERTALENTED USERS OF THIS BOARD. ONCE IN A WHILE THIS IS PERFECTLY
121 ALL RIGHT, BUT WHAT ABOUT EVERY-DAMNED-TIME? HE HAS BEEN HERE CONSTANTLY 
122 SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER, HANGING AROUND LIKE A LEECH. HE PUTS UP HIS STORIES,
123 GETS UPSET WHEN EVERYBODY DOESN'T SWOON OVER THEM, AND THEN DECIDES TO GIV US
124 LARGER SAMPLES TO LOOK OVER. MEANWHILE, PEOPLE GET FRUSTRATED NOT ONLY WITH
125 HAVING TO READ THIS GUNK, BUT WITH THE WASTED SPACE AS WELL. IF SILVERMAN 
126 WANTS TO TAKE OVER A BOARD, LET HIM PUT UP HIS OWN. THIS IS A *PUBLIC* BOARD,

149 Yea thats telling em!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
150 Is that bbs at 665-xxxx mentioned above at 1200 baud?
151 
152 
153 +++++++++++++
154 Survey done of bbs list on Bit Bucket.  Results: 13 systems can do up to
155 2400 baud.  36 Systems can do 1200.   22 can do only 300.
156 Rhetorical question:  1200 baud modems are selling new for as little as $
157 170.00.  These days, a phone line costs about $15 per month.  In other words,
158 the costs of the modem is quite low compared with the monthly costs.
159 So why don't more bbs's install at least 1200 baud modems?  In BW, the  
160 problem is technical, not financial.  But on others, why not?
161 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ P. V. Jeltz ++++++++++++++++++
162 Ah, here we are again. The age old pseudo-argument about what people *should* and *shouldn't* do here on Backwater.
163 "This is a "public" BBS, and I demand my time". Wrong. BWMS is *privately* owned. 
164 "I do not like what the Destroyer writes, and I do not like him taking up *all that space*. And I intend to take up
165 just as much space in bitching about this."
166 (Translation- 'I don't have the talent or the imagination to write anything interesting, so I will express my frustratio
167 n by criticizing those who do).
168 "I don't think this should be that or whatever should be anything other than what *I* want", and I will snivel and 
169 cry 'till I have antagonized everyone. I am mentally twelve years old, and I'll act like a child if I want to, even
170 though physically, I am thirty nine." And so it goes...
171 I will agree with some of you, in that Destroyers stories are not the "best of Backwater". However: At least the guy
172 *writes* something other than sniveling, criticising, bitching, and moaning. He isn't *that* bad. He is one helluva
173 lot better than you borderless mindless talentless sniveling semi-literate clowns that have nothing good to say about
174 anything. You jerks bemoan the essence of what you are not capable of understanding. Do us Backwater Irregulars a favor
175 and sell your computers, and use the proceeds to go back and finish middle school. [*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*]

193    
194    They gaped at each other for a long, comical second, then scrambled for the stairway. Poor Dudley almost got
195 trampled in the process. By mutual unspoken consent they all ran for the commissary. The commissary was on the east
196 side of the building and one entire wall consisted of a fifteen by forty foot multipaned window, overlooking scenic Mt.
197 Hood. They crowded in through the door and Dudley came in last and pushed through them. Hopping up and down, he pointed
198 out the window. "There! You see? You see?"
199    But nobody had a reply for him.
200    Where Mt. Hood once stood a huge grey-black mushroom cloud now rose towards the sky like a mighty fist. The cumulus
201 above was being sucked towards it. It was like St. Helens again but the mountain wasn't erupting. It was simply gone.
202 Norbert voiced the first thought that came to all their minds. "Nukes."
203    "No." Frank said shakily, "That's not a fireball. That cloud's from... from..." Suddenly his eyes widened in horror.
204 "Oh, my God."
205    There were about fifteen people in the commissary. At the moment they all had their noses plastered to the glass
206 trying to see better. "Get away from that window!" Frank roared at them. "Get some cover! NOW!!"
207    It was the panic in Frank's voice that did the trick. The people began backing away from the window, not
208 understanding why. Frank grabbed Jean and hustled back out into the hall. Norbert, Doug, and Dudley followed, also
209 confused. Jean began to protest at this manhanding but her words were suddenly lost in the rising howl from
210 outside.
211    The howl rose to a scream of hurricane force winds and they all suddenly felt as if icepicks were being jabbed in
212 their ears. The pain increased tenfold and there was a loud BOOM as every window in the building exploded outward from
213 the pressure difference. Then the hurricane was inside, sucking up papers, books, chairs, anything small that wasn't
214 nailed down. Accompanying this chaos was a loud, basso rumbling that first rattled their ears, then shook the whole
215 building.
216    The hallway was fairly well protected from all of this, but it was still like standing in a wind tunnel. Jean buried
217 her face in Frank'S chest and clutched him desperately, as if to keep from blowing away, although it was hardly that
218 bad. Dudley, scared out of his wits, had a similar grip on Norbert, and was in serious danger of strangling him. Doug
219 simply put his hands over his face and collapsed against the wall, sobbing.
220    Slowly the wind and rumbling died down, leaving everybody feeling as if their ears were stuffed full of cotton.
221 Norbert finally untangled himself from Dudley with a curse. Dudley, bereft of his support, ran down the hall screaming
222 hysterically. Jean held on to Frank for a long time before letting go. Norbert yelled, "You knew that was going to
223 happen!"
224    "An implosion." Frank replied. "The mountain dissappeared and left a vacuum. Air rushed in to fill it, sucking up
225 all kinds of dirt and debris and crap. That's what the cloud was. Soon as I realized that, I knew there was going to be
226 a shockwave." Something tickled his nose. He rubbed it and his hand came away covered in blood. Norbert had a
227 nosebleed, too.
228    They went back into the commissary. There was a huge hole in the wall where the window used to be. The mushroom
229 cloud had become a haze that covered most of the horizon. Tables, chairs, food and trays were strewn all over the room.
230 People began to pick themselves up painfully. Nobody seemed seriously hurt. Norbert was mumbling something they
231 couldn't hear. "What?" Jean asked.
232    He turned to them with haunted eyes. "It couldn't be a coincidence. The mountain vanished at the exact same time the
233 experiment blew up."
234    "What are you talking about?"
235    Norbert pointed out the window shakily. "We did that."

240 Zephyr -- commendable restraint.  However, your next job is to make your
241 character, Straxi, more than just a cardboard cut-out.  I suggest that you
242 think some about who he/she/it/fill_in_the_blanks is and what drives hesh.
243 Remember, hesh is an *alien*, a chlorine breather, and physically unlike
244 the human/oids hesh is confronting.  (Pardon the indeterminate pronoun, but
245 it seems appropriate here.)  You have a problem in working out what drives
246 such a character.  We can extrapolate from the life-forms that we know 
247 (always keeping in mind that this "person" is alien).  All known life forms
248 seem to have a built-in drive to survive.  Presumably alien life-forms will
249 share that drive if they're still around.  To survive, a life-form needs to
250 take in the nourishment it needs for metabolism.  We take in food, water,
251 and air -- fuel, liquid, and oxygen -- to generate the energy we expend in
252 the business of living.  Presumably your alien does something analagous
253 (but it doesn't *have* to be exactly the same).  Where we get onto shaky
254 ground is when we start thinking about the *culture* that your alien comes
255 from.  You've established an atmospheric helmet of some sort, and a tele-
256 portation device, so the alien has some sort of technelogical culture.
257   Just a suggestion -- how about a culture based on biological, rather
258 than physical science?  A culture that bred living organisms to do the jobs
259 we fabricate tools for would be different enough to keep us interested...
260   Please spend some time thinking about the background of your character,
261 and we could make a group tour to find out more about hesh's culture.
262 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
263   The piper, lost in the joy of pain-free breathing, suddenly choked again.
264 The sharp reek of chlorine filled the already-crowded interior of the bard's
265 transporter while the crowding suddenly increased most appreciably.  A large
266 six-limbed creature wearing a patterned crimson and purple garment over its
267 slate-blue hide suddenly appeared in their midst.  Leaping to conclusions,
268 as the creature evidenced distress in their atmosphere, the piper remarked
269 to his companions as the creature fumbled at some sort of head covering:
270   "I believe that a representative of the local life-forms has arrived."
271   The creature did not appear agressive.  It fumbled with it's head covering
272 with two limbs, seeming to adjust it for comfort, while two other limbs
273 fumbled with something that seemed to be attached to a belt around what
274 would be the creature's waist if it had a waist.  The belt-mounted device
275 made a number of downright impolite sounds, then spoke clearly to the
276 crowded little group:
277   "Hello.  I am ..."
278   As the creature finished its brief introduction, the piper tried to move.
279 The crowded confines of the bard's vehicle was certainly not the place to
280 try to make first contact with an alien race!

287      Straxi saw that his translator had done the job, as introductions were
288 then made with a minimum of confusion.  When Straxi heard the alien s' story,
289 he was amazed.  These creatures cou:ld immensly help the science of H'ran!
290 If he could present this finding to the Guild of Science, his reward would be
291 great.  But these were obviously intelligent creatures, and the Guild
292 forbade the capture of any intelligent life forms.  Besides, he wasn't really
293 a scientist.  He had been, cycles ago, but the Guild only acceptDed the top
294 beings for membership.  Straxi`s still dabbled`in science, constructing small
295 range teleporters, but that was abou| t it.
296  `   But there was nothing stopping Straxi from simply ASKING the aliens
297 if they would like to accompany him to hithe nearest Guild.  He spoke once again
298 to the aliens.
299     "I have... a suggestion.  Why don't we aall visit  a wonderous place that I
300 hithink you will find interesting.  It's called txehre Guild of Science..."    
301      Straxi`h xohoped they would, for he` felt that a meeting of the races such
302 as this would mean a new era for both races.

306     The Former ran his paw over the shiny surface of the device.  The midget of
307 a trader stood behind him.  A circle of red dots on the surface lit and one dot
308 after the other lit and then darkened.  The midget wiped his hands on his pants
309 and pointed to the device.
310     "It is, a, matter tracker.  Does it entice you?"  Said the midget in an
311 accent so severe it might have broken concrete.  The midget glanced at the tall
312 Former and pointed all over the device.
313     "Does it track teleportation?"  Asked the Former in a cynical tone.
314     "It does, and more, it has directions on the rear, see?"  The midget wiped
315 his hands on his pant leg again and went to check his merchandise.
316     "I will buy it, this is the price you asked,"  The Former stalked off on
317 his hind legs uneasily.  The Former set the device to a teleportation, and sent
318 himself to the outside of the Inn.
319     The Former appeared a scant inch from the wall.  Donning an atmospheric
320 pressure suit and tapping the oxygen reserves, the Former set the device to
321 a tracking mode and activated the device.  The device followed the initial
322 transportation of the Innkeeper and the Former appeared where the Innkeeper
323 had a short time ago.
324     The Former tried to read the device.  It told him a teleporter with an
325 itchy activator accidentally tripped the Innkeeper here.  It also told him the
326 position of the teleporter.  And so off he walked, through the chlorine air.

343 Great, another false phone number has been left on this board.  I always fi
344 find it interesting to find out who's phone number is left in places like 
345 this.  Usually, the people are older or retired and know nothing about
346 computers, especialy modems, bulletin boards are unthinkable!  And 9 times
347 out of 10 the people are asleep when you call, makes for a happy
348 conversation!
349 So, if the ENTER-ONLY is ever changed back someone can delete that number
350 above and give one old lady a good nights sleep at last.  When I called she
351 didn't sound too pleased about the whole situation, not at all!
352 Mike, give the old lady a break.
353 
354 YEAH, LET HER HAVE SOME PEACE AND QUIET!!!  DE 96 IS ALL YOU HAVE TO STRAIN YOURSELF WITH MR DAY!!!

356 ANOTHER SNIDE REMARK BROUGHT TO YOU BY MR SILVERMAN.
357 Emu- finals cha cha tempo? What are you taking, and what are you taking for it? 
358 Would you believe finals tempo die valkerie, 1812 overature, Capriccio Italiene, and some thundering Mahler at 140 dB?
359 I find it difficult to believe that *anyone* totally understands a peripheral interface adapter. (PIA for Pain In Ass)
360 Enjoyed meeting you at last meeting. Will be at next meeting *after* finals week. Will probably be drunk. Will probably
361 not remember. Will unfortunately probably remember address decoding...[*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*]

363 MR. WONDERFUL HAS APPARENTLY BEEN AT IT AGAIN. FIRST OFF, HE GIVES US 50+ LINES
364 OF DESTROYER GUEST STARRING THAT STUPID RABBIT THAT WE HAD ALL ONCE HOPED HAD
365 GONE AWAY FOR GOOD. I THINK MAYBE ZEPHYR IS ANOTHER ONE OF HIS NAMES. IT 
366 WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME AT ALL. AND IF THAT AINT ENOUGH, HE GIVES US ANOTHER 
367 70 LINES OF THIS STUPID PSUEDO-SCIENCE FICTION STORY FEATURING THE RIDICULOUSLY
368 EXXAGERATED EFFECTS OF WHAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN IF SUCH AN UNLIKELY EVENT AS
369 THE ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE HAPPENED. AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, I CAN@T GET OVER THE
370 FEELING I HAVE SEEN IT ALL SOMEWHERE BEFORE.
371 I GOT ON THE BLUE PARROT YESTERDAY, AND APPERANTLY HE HAS THE BOARD ALL SEWN 
372 UP AS WELL. HE MANAGED TO MAKE THE 1000TH CALLER, WHICH DOESN@T SURPRISE ME 
373 SINCE HE HAS PROBABLY MADE HALF THE TOTAL CALLS TO THAT BOARD AND UNDOUBTEDLY
374 OWNS 2/3RDS OF THE ALIASES THERE AS WELL. WHY DO I GET THE FEELONG THAT WHEN I
375 GO TO READ THE STORIES I WILL FIND ONLY TWO NAMES LISTED THERE?
376 DOESN'T THIS GUY HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO WITH HIS TIME BESIDES SPEND HOURS
377  HOURS ON EVERY BBS IN PORTLAND? I GUESS NOT. HE IS PROBABLY SUCH A NERD THAT 
378 THIS IS THE CLOSEST THING HE HAS TO A SOCIAL LIFE AND WITHOUT HIS MODEM HE 
379 WOULD PROBABLY COMMIT SUICIDE FROM SHEER BOREDOM. INSTEAD HE IS CAUSING 
380 EVERYBODY ELSE TO CONSIDER TAKING DRASTIC STEPS FROM SHEER BOREDOM. 
381 I THINK WE SHOULD SHOW HIM HOW WE *REALLY* FEEL. ONE, TWO, THREE........

394 you know, this nom de guerre guy probably has an incredibly healthy stupidity.
395 he certainly excersises it enough. too bad acting like such a moron is really
396 self-defeating, because the point that he so crudely hammers on over and over
397 again really has some validity, i think. i really do wish silverman would give
398 it a rest for a while. c'est la vive.

401   The piper looked at the blue-skinned alien who, with his bulky suit,
402 took so much of the limited space in the bard's transporter.
403   "Yes, I too would like to know some of your laws and customs before going
404 out on any tours of exploration.  We've come quite unprepared for a long
405 stay, cannot breath the local atmosphere, and are probably putting a strain
406 on the bard's life support systems.  What type of government do you have?
407 What type of economic system do you have?  How does a being obtain the b
408 basics of life?"
409 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
410 Zephyr -- would you like to work those things out on your own, or would 
411 you like us to supply some of the answers?  If we get going on designing an
412 alien culture, it could end up nearly anywhere and you'd be stuck with the
413 consequences -- of course it might be more imaginative than any one of us
414 could come up with on his/her own...

Nom de guerre, If you really don't like all that John Silverman is
418 
doing here you could always go somewhere else. I personnally enjoy
419 
his entries very much and that's more that I can say for most of what
420 
has been going onhere at the Inn lately. 
421 
Mr. Silverman, please continue in your stories. I really enjoy them
422 
because they often give me a break from the daily routine here at work.

425 Non De Guerre,

426      I think that you complain a wee bit too much.

427      First,  the  space  on  this system is not "wasted" by a  user  placing 
428 something here in an honest attempt to be creative.   The only waste is when 
429 line  after line is filled with carriage  returns,  line-feeds,  meaningless 
430 patterns, and so forth.

431      But even that really isn't a waste,  because when the disk fills up, it 
432 is  simply replaced with a fresh disk.   The disk isn't wasted because it is 
433 erased  and recycled.   The space isn't wasted because we have new space  to 
434 use.  If it is your time that you're worried about being wasted, it is quite 
435 easy  to  simply skip over what you don't want to read using the FI  and  DO 
436 commands  as some of the other users have described.   That was one  of  the 
437 points of having borders to begin with:  you know the border,  so you simply 
438 skip  to  the next occurance of the border and you have skipped that  entire 
439 entry.   Thus,  if it is your time you are concerned about being wasted, all 
440 you need to do is make the attempt to save that time by using the facilities 
441 that are provided.

442      But please,  don't continue to berate Cistop Mikey for his opinion; you 
443 already have it.   He isn't the sort to voice his opinion,  if the entry  is 
444 offensive  or  impromper  by  his standards it will be  eliminated  with  no 
445 commentary.   It will simply be gone.   His standards are well expressed  in 
446 the opening lines of each disk.  You, and others, would do well to read them 
447 carefully, and perhaps you would gain a better understanding of what BWMS is 
448 all about.   It is an open forum, a blank slate, the use of which is defined 
449 by the callers.   Cistop Mikey retains his control,  but keeps his hands off 
450 for  the  most  part  because he knows that creativity  flowers  best  where 
451 censorship is utilized the least.   And I think that includes your insulting 
452 diatribes as well.

453      Now children, please..... PLAY NICE!

482 Unbelievable. A guy takes the time and expense to set up a BBS for writers, and what does he get.? Scumbags
483 that have nothing better to do with their time than call up BBS's and insult others. I would like to meet you low lifes
484 face to face. I'd like to teach you some manners. I'd like to break a lot of your fingers. I would enjoy doing a lot
485 of damage to your immature bodies.

500  I thought the note above was funny but it I agree with most of it. I'M begining to think that DESTROYER hurt some
501 one in there personal lives. And are just berating him here because of it. The best note I think was the one that 
502 said to read the begining message. Also why don't I see these 'critics' writting. If they don't like him here fill 
503 the space with something better. I would like to see more on the story about that girl learning magic from a gypsy.

507 NO, THE DESTROYER HASN'T HURT ME IN MY PERSONAL LIFE. SOMEONE AS INEFFECTUAL
508 AND NERDLY CAN'T HURT ME. I SIMPLY STATE THAT SILVERMAN (HE IS THE DESTROYER
509 TOO, YOU KNOW) IS USING UP TOO MUCH SPACE, TIME AND PATIENCE WITH HIS OVER-
510 RATED WRITING. THE MARK OF A GOOD WRITER IS THE ABILITY TO GET HIS POINT 
511 ACROSS IN AS FEW WORDS AS POSSIBLE. A LOOK AT HIS PAST ENTRIES WILL SHOW A
512 DEFINITE TENDANCY TO WANDER AIMLESSLY AROUND THE POINT, WASTING SPACE AS HE
513 DOES SO. WHEN HE DOES GET TO THE POINT, HE USUALLY SHOWS AN INEPTNESS THAT IS
514 MOST APPARENT IN FIFTH-GRADE ESSAY WRITING. I THINK THE GUY SHOULD REALLY 
515 DISAPEAR FROM THE SCENE FOR A WHILE, A LONG WHILE, AND POLISH UP HIS CRAFT 
516 MORE. THEN, MAYBE, HE MIGHT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF OTHERS ON THIS BOARD LIKE
517 ZEPHYR OR PIPER OR BARD OR MOST OF THE OTHERS. PERSONALLY, I THINK THE BEST
518 WRITER CURRENTLY ON HERE IS EMU, WITH HIS TOO RARELY SEEN MAGIC TALE. EMU IS
519 SO MUCH BETTER THAN SILVERMAN THAT IT'S PITIFUL. IF HE EVER THINKS HE MIGH GET
520 HALF THAT GOOD HE IS WET-DREAMING. BUT I AM SIMPLY SICK OF SEEING SILVERMAN,
521 SILVERMAN, AND MORE SILVERMAN EVERYWHERE I LOOK. THE GUY IS REALLY HURTING
522 FOR ATTENTION AND APPARENTLY DOESN'T REALIZE HOW BADLY HE IS BORING EVERYBODY
523 IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO GET THAT ATTENTION.

602 Now I find that extremely interesting since I have never been on 
603 Noname BBS, yet the call list that shows above indicates I have.
604 Even more interesting that it is at 6am, Since I don't and never
605 have done any BBS work at that time of day. 
606 So a note to all bbs owners, check first, I only call two systems
607 in town at this time, Nerd, and Blue Parrot. I don't have the time
608 to call even those more then occasionally, so it is almost certain
609 that if my name shows up it is not me. 
610 *************************** CISTOP MIKEY **************************
611 Oh yes, in regard to the debate, as has been stated, my veiws are already
612 stated. I have a hands off policy on this board, I only step in when 
613 I feel that someone is being disruptive, or attempts to cause damage.
614 Other then that, like any good Inn, I let my patrons determine the
615 atmosphere. Many of you don't realize it, but I did not set this up to
616 be a "writer's board". It is simply a open forum BBS that anyone can
617 access (even the idiot above). It became what it is because the patrons
618 defined it. BWMS is constantly changing and evolving. It is a blank
619 slate, it is the users that create the reality that is BWMS. Thus as 
620 those patrons change, so does the reality of BW change.
621 While I personaly don't find Mr. Silverman's stories to be the greatest
622 thing since sliced bread, they do show promise. Obviously, he does enjoy
623 writing, being as prolific as he is shows that. I would urge him to take
624 some creative writing courses though, it would help him to improve a bit.
625 And, if I am to take a constructive jab at you J.D. I would suggest that
626 you ease up on the bit of killing your main characters off or mortally 
627 wounding them and then miraculously they are alive again in the next segment
628 Once or twice this is acceptable, but after a while it becomes a habit,
629 and the emotions and flavor become lost. ********** CM ****************
