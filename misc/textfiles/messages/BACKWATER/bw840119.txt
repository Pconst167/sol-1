27      The shutters of Pam's cottage rammed home abrubtly, cutting off the
28 voices intense in battle, and a shrill cry rose in indignant protest--
29 there, the eyes that had been so rapt now shimmered with annoyance at
30 this greivance!  So quiet had this little creature been, the birds had
31 not even noticed it, but now there was a sudden hush of awe pervading
32 the forest, as it arched its silky length and swept out wings of incred-
33 ibly frail appearance.  How regal it looked, how stunning the shade of
34 purple that glittered into burgundy and deepest ruby on its sleek body!
35 
The fire lizard soared effortlessly from the evergreen where it had kept
36 watch, mood changed to concern as swiftly as a vagrant breeze, and 
37 circled Pam's home, uttering chirrups soft and worried, prying for an
38 open window.  Finding none, it hesitated, hovering by the door, and 
39 its little brow furrowed--wha--?  It disappeared!  So unexpected was
40 this occurance that all the birds fled as one, squawking in dismay!
41      

She had found a sheltered streamlet where naught but the wild had
42 stepped, where the sun had cheated the winter; where peace dwelt.  There
43 she loosened her bound-up hair and dipped her feet into the lazy stream,
44 allowing the caress of the water to soothe her fears.  Surrendering to
45 sleep, she noticed not the wisp of lace that escaped from her hem to
46 meander downstream...
Her dreams were entwined with memories, cameos of
47 old friends, images of welcoming faces--and a smile curled softly on
48 her lips as she nestled closer to the fresh earth scent in sleep--the
49 Inn in its many fascinating phases paraded past:  the controversies, the
50 storytellers, the voices of song, a kite and a man needing comfort from
51 troublesome dreams, sassafrass tea and justice dealt to an interloper,
52 a back room meeting...
The awakening was dramatic, for she snapped bolt
53 upright with a gasp, her eyes still dilated from sleep, and whispered
54 in what was meant to be a shout of joy:  "The Believer--'tis he!"
55 Weaving unsteadily from so sudden an awakening, she sat for a moment,
56 her face aglow with the steadily-growing recognition.  "Yes, I'm sure
57 of it!"  Gathering her skirts, she scrambled to her feet in haste,
58 for tonight she would dine at the Inn & renew old friendships!

60 	The runes were clear, but their meaning was clouded. Pam is home, that much
61 is clear. And she is alive and well. Yet they will say nothing regarding the
62 future, save: stay away!
63 	Sighing, he returned them to the bag and drew them forth again, this time to
64 ask of d. What is this? She returns! 
65 	Swiftly, he put away the stones. He then returned to his chores with a speed 
66 that would have impressed his master, had that worthy been present.
67 	An hour later, he was on his way to then inn.....

75    Patrons of this fair Inn.....
76 With the new year behind us my thoughts turn to what is yet to come.
77  
78   My major preoccupation of recent years has been sailing....and after crewing
79 for others I have decided to throw my fair craft into the fray. For better or
80 worse. And since a majority of the sailing experience is dependent on the 
81 crew I can think of no better forum to make my inital request.
82 I am looking for 4-5 sailors...and my requirements are few.
83        (A)  A working knowledge of sailing & its terms.
84        (B)  Availability; Tuesday nite SYSCO series, occasional Friday nite 
85 beer can race ( a la MT Bottle & Deli ) and a few weekend regattas.
86        And the last which is open to individual interpretation because.....
87 As is often the case , the conclusion of a race is frequently cause for 
88 celebration or solace.......So being of legal drinking age has its benifits
89   Should any of you be so aquatically inclined leave a small note where & when
90 you can be contacted.

92 		Thomas the Rhymer	(based on a poem by Rudyard Kipling)
93 True Thomas lay on Huntlie Bank;
94 	A ferlie he spied wi' his e'e
95 And there he saw a lady bright,
96 	Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.
97 
98 Her skirt was o' the grass-green silk,
99 	Her mantle o' the velvet fine,
100 At ilks tett of her horse's mane
101 	Hung fifty silver bells and nine.
102 
103 True Thomas he pulled off his cap
104 	And louted down low on his knee;
105 "All hail, thou mighty Queen of Heaven!
106 	Thy peer on earth I ne'er did see."
107 
108 "Oh no, oh no, Thomas," she said,
109 	"That name does not belong to me;
110 I'm but the Queen of fair Elfland,
111 	That am come hither to visit thee.
112 
113 "Harp and carp, Thomas," she said,
114 	"Harp and carp along wi' me;
115 But if ye dare to kiss my lips,
116 	Sure of your body I will be."
117 
118 "Betide me weal, betide me woe,
119 	That wyrd shall never daunten me."
120 Syne he has kissed her rosy lips,
121 	All underneath the Eildon Tree.
122 
123 "Now ye maun go wi' me," she said,
124 	"True Thomas, ye maun go wi' me,
125 And ye maun serve me seven years
126 	Through weal or woe, as may chance to be."
127 
128 She has mounted her on the milk-white steed,
129 	She's ta'en True Thomas up behind;
130 And aye whene'er her bridle rang,
131 	The steed flew swifter than the wind.
132 
133 Oh they rade on, and farther on,
134 	The steed gaed swifter than the wind;
135 Until they reached a desert wide,
136 	And living land was left behind.
137 
138 "Light down, light down now, True Thomas,
139 	And lean your head upon my knee;
140 Abide and rest a little space,
141 	And I will show you ferlies three.
142 
143 Oh see ye not yon narrow road,
144 	So thick beset wi' thorn and briar?
145 That is the road of righteousness,
146 	And after it but few enquire.
147 
148 And see ye not yon braid braid road
149 	That lies across the lily leven?
150 That is the path of wickedness,
151 	Though some call it the road to Heaven.
152 
153 "And see ye not yon bonny road
154 	That winds about the ferny brae?
155 That is the road to fair Elfland,
156 	Where thou and I this night maun gae.
157 
158 "But Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue,
159 	Whatever ye may hear or see;
160 For if you speak word in Elfinland,
161 	Ye'll ne'er win back to your ain countrie."
162 
163 Oh they rade on, and further on,
164 	They rode through blood aboon the knee;
165 And they saw neither sun nor moon,
166 	But heard the roaring of the sea.
167 
168 Syne they came to a garden green;
169 	She pulled an apple from a tree;
170 "Take this for they wage, True Thomas,
171 	'Twill give thee a tongue that can never lie."
172 
173 "Me tongue's me ain," True Thomas said;
174 	"A goodly gift ye'd gie to me!
175 I'd neither dought to buy nor sell,
176 	At fair or tryst, where I may be.
177 
178 "I'd neither dought speak to prince nor peer,
179 	Nor ask of grace frae fair ladye."
180 "Now hold your peace," the lady said,
181 	"For as I say, so it must be."
182 
183 He has gotten a coat o' the elven cloth,
184 	He's gotten shoes o' velvet green;
185 And 'till seven years were gane and past,
186 	True Thomas on earth was never seen.

194 THERESA: NOTES ON RESEARCH REGARDING HI-TECH GREEN;
195   By microscopic examination, I have discovered that it is not the carpet
196 itself that is causing this insideous blight, but an organism which
197 infects the carpet, and then mimics it as a form of camouflage.  This
198 orgamism is greatly affected by high wind velocities, so it only exists
199 indoors.  Also, the application of high wind velocity devices, such as
200 the common household vacuum cleaner, can kill great numbers of these
201 organisms.  This is evident in the number of lost items found during
202 application of the vacuum, and that for a short period of time after
203 the organisms are removed, lost items may still be found on the floor.
204 Since it is impossible to prevent re-infestation, however, the carpet
205 will soon regain its voracious appetite.  
206 	     In addition, it is not the items themselves which are needed by
207 Hi-Tech Green, but the body oils and residues on the item are absorbed
208 and used as food by the system.  This startling fact leads us to have
209 seconds thoughts regarding close contact between these infected flooring
210 surfaces and any large amounts of unclothed body area.  The organism
211 has evolved, however, to closely simulate normal carpeting, and cannot
212 infect rugs derived from animal hairs.  Bear Skin rugs are safe. 
213 Finally, through extensive research, I have determined that light
214 interferes with the digestive processes of Hi-Tech Green, and thus
215 most edible items are quickly removed from the spots where they land
216 on to the carpet, to darkend areas such as under chairs, sofas, etc.

219      The spectators found it hard to contain their emotions, for the
220 day had not gone well.  One child had already died on the platform
221 that morning.  Another child had struggled so long that brain damage
222 had occurred, leaving him to wander on lonely paths of insanity,
223 perhaps without cure.  To be sure, others had survived and found the
224 way out of that place, but the strain of another Initiation was 
225 telling on those who watched.
226      Marcus stepped onto the platofrm and turned back to see Ben
227 standing only a few feet away.  it would be all right, he'd said.
228 It was in that moment that Marc knew that men could lie.

249                                     Sitting in
250                              the early   dawn light,
251                    reassembling the pieces of self; after a
252         night charitably described as confusing.  The flow of
253                     awareness roams toward its limits.
254                            At one level there is
255                     the awareness that all 
256              is well and as it should
257           be. It always was and
258             always is. The question is
259                    how does one continue to make
260                        this awareness a reality in
261                      their own life? ...moment 
262                        by moment ...day by day.
263                 As I place these thoughts into
264            symbols and words, freeze dried into
265         language, I look up just in time to see a
266       beautiful Great Blue Heron as it walks along
267          the river bank; only a few feet away. Elegance
268          and beauty with its feet stuck in the mud. There
269              it is sloshing along knee deep in water searching
270                for food. How does this creature of such grace and
271                     stature rise up from the mud and soar, free on the
272                        wind? As if reading my thoughts, it chooses that
273                              moment to spread its wings.  In a flash, with
274                                          one swift motion this huge winged
275                                                creature rises above it all
276                                                 and skims across the water.
277                                                     After witnessing such
278                                                      a sight, could I do
279                                                     less than give my

306      THE WEATHER IS DRY AND COLD, BUT THE SKY CLEAR AND THE SUN SHINES
307 BRIGHTLY UPON MY FACE.  MY PACE IS BRISK, SO MUCH SO THAT I BREAK INTO A
308 RUN, AND CONTINUE FOR ALMOST A MILE BEFORE I STOP AND COLLAPSE, LAUGHING,
309 INTO THE TALL WINTER GRASS THAT LINES THE ROAD.  AM I OUT OF BREATH FROM
310 THE RUN, OR IS IT MY LAUGHING THAT CAUSES MY BREATH TO COME IN GASPS?  AH,
311 THE WORLD IS GRAND!  AND I AM A PART OF THAT WORLD, SO MY VERY EXISTANCE
312 CAN BE GRAND IF ONLY I LET IT BE SO!
313 
314      MY LAUGHTER CONTINUES, BUT LIGHTLY, FOR A FULL FIVE MINUTES, AND IT IS
315 ANOTHER FIVE BEFORE I CARE TO RISE AGAIN FROM THIS MOST COMFORTABLE OF
316 NATURE'S THRONES.  O, GOOD BHARNAE, THE CHANGES YOU'VE HELPED BRING TO ME
317 ARE MORE IN ATTITUDE THAN APPEARANCE, BUT EVEN APPEARANCE CHANGES WHEN
318 ONE'S ATTITUDE IS ALTERED SUFFICIENTLY.  WILL ANYONE AT THE INN RECOGNIZE
319 ME?  MY GRACIOUS INNKEEPER KNOWS MY MANY MOODS AND FACES, SO HE WILL NOT
320 FIND SURPRISE HERE, BUT MANY OTHER INN-GOERS MAY WONDER WHO THIS STRANGE,
321 HAPPY MAID IS.
322 
323      I THINK OF THE YOUNG APPRENTICE WHO OFFERED HIS AID TO ME NIGHTS AGO.
324 HE PROBABLY REMEMBERS ME AS AN UNHAPPY AND DOUR WITCH, FILLED WITH THOUGHTS
325 OF DEATH AND TURMOIL.  I BEGIN TO CHUCKLE AGAIN, THINKING OF HIS REACTION
326 WHEN HE SEES ME NOW.  I'LL KISS HIS CHEEK AND PULL HIS EAR, YOUTHFUL ROGUE,
327 TO SEE THE SHOCK THAT WILL ARISE!
328 
329      TURNING THE FAMILIAR BEND IN THE ROAD, I SEE THE FOOTBRIDGE AND THE
330 INN BEYOND.  I SUSPECT THAT THE USUAL TABLE AT THE BACK WILL NEED CLEANING,
331 BUT I WON'T ATTEND TO IT JUST YET.  I'LL STOP AND HAVE AN ALE MYSELF,
332 RELAX, AND MERELY ENJOY MY SURROUNDINGS FOR AWHILE.  I CAN TEND TO THAT
333 TABLE LATER, AFTER I'VE TAKEN SOME TIME FOR MYSELF.  MY THOUGHTS TURN TO
334 BHARNAE, WHOSE NAME FIRST APPEARED TO ME IN THE FORM THAT WAS MOST
335 RECOGNIZEABLE TO ME RATHER THAN ITS TRUE FORM.  LIKE SHAKESPEARE'S PUCK,
336 HIS SENSE OF HUMOR HAS BROUGHT ABOUT SERIOUS CHANGES IN A MORTAL, AND TO
337 THE BETTER.
338 
339      "Puck?" a voice cries in my ear, "Puck is a fag!"
340 
341      "WHAT?!" I CRY, STOPPING DEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH.
342 
343      "You hoid me," THE VOICE RESPONDS, CHANGING TO THAT OF ONE ARCHIE

357 !~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~
358      The Marakesh Express rumbled along...the gentle swaying taking him to
359 the land of fantasy he loved so much.  He dreamed of the gentle 'd', the
360 one he admired.  Of Pam... once so reticent, but now a blossoming creative
361 force, involving many patrons on the Inn in her adventures.  Of bards and
362 pipers...of melancholy, terror, and suspense... Of poetry and beauty.
363      Suddenly, the soft click of a door opening brought the Inspector to
364 full wakefullness.  Without thought he moved as with the wind--flying to
365 the door.  When he arrived, no one was there.
366      A low, sweet chuckle came from his right; "Alberto, I see you're still
367 as quick as a tiger.  But you're getting a little careless."
368      The tenseness drained from Salazar's body.  He knew the one before him
369 could kill instantly and without remorse, but he knew she would not.  "Ah
370 Serena, I had a feeling we would meet again, but not so soon.  As for
371 carelessness," he shrugged, "I would have killed a normal human being the
372 moment the door opened."
373      Serena switiched on a small reading light revealing her beauty.  "Yes,
374 I guess I'm not normal, am I?  Neither is the Ninja...Beware, he will be
375 your greatest challenge."
376      Salazar smiled, "Where is he? Tell me what you know of him."
377      "He has retired to the abandoned monastary known as the 'Rat's Nest'
378 to do battle with you.  First you must grapple with his minion in Marakesh.
379 Philippe will help you; look for him at the Inn of the Blue Parrot.  As for
380 the Ninja himself... they say that his Iron Palm did in Bruce Lee."
381      "Hm,"  Salazar speculated, "I always thought there was something 
382 strange about that affair... the delayed death technique would explain alot
383 of things.  What about McKane and the Russian?"
384      "I'm not sure, the last I heard they were in South America.  We 
385 received payment from the Afganistan Freedom Fighters to keep the Russian,
386 but I don't know what McKane plans now."
387      Salazar's eyes flashed;  "I've missed you, Serena."
388      "And I you, Alberto. I have something for you."  She moved close to him
389 taking a jeweled amulent from her neck and placing it around his.  "It is
390 said to ahve been a talisman of an ancient and powerful wizard."
391      He took her in his arms, "Let's forget murder and intrigue for a while
392 and create our own world of love."
393      She smiled softly, "We'll have to do without the donkey and the dwarf.
394 Does that matter?"
395      Laughing, "I think we'll manage."  He reached for the light.

403 The piper swung his pipes to his shoulder, took a deep breath to inflate
404 the bag, then paused.  Someone was talking to his new acquaintance, the 
405 bard who had just finished an old song of surpassing beauty.  A ref-
406 erence caught his ear.
407    "Gostak??"
408 Quickly he stepped over to the bard and whispered:
409 "Quietly, I don't want to start a riot, but please ask your
410 friend if he is one that holds that a relationship between the
411 Doshes and the Gostak is defined by the act of distimming.  If
412 so, to which persuasion does he hold?"

449   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   23:33   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
450      A sprightly tune came cavorting out into the forest, with snatches
451 of song intermixed; some voices melodic & flutelike, some throaty with
452 emotion, yet others bellowed out heartily.  The general effect was quite
453 cheering, if somewhat ludicrous; in fact, the whole Inn generated an
454 aura of joyousness and a curious expectancy...
She wondered why, as her
455 steps became hesitant, as they ever did upon approach to the Backwater.
456 It had become almost a ceremony, this timidness; and she drew close to
457 her usual waiting post, where she could look upon the patrons, observe
458 whom had come to sup and study their faces as they laughed and drank...
459 
Ah!  There by the rough-hewn door, a familiar figure with eyes bright
460 and penetrating:  'twas the apprentice with a knot of friends clustered
461 about him; he kept twisting around as if looking for something.  Oh!
462 She flushed and drew back from the window, for their eyes had met.  Just
463 a trace of a smile tugged at his beard, however, and he turned back 
464 slowly to his mulled cider.  
His elaborate show of unconcern elicited a
465 grateful smile from the maiden, and she vowed to pluck up courage to
466 speak to him some time later.  
Her eyes were drawn to the modest table
467 back near the kitchen...why, where was Pam tonight?  The Innkeeper did
468 not seem perturbed, in fact, he was whistling along with the piper as
469 he brought out a tray of foaming glasses.  Tarn was nowhere to be found
470 either, but the young blond storyteller called Daver had his audience's
471 attention riveted, his eyes intense and his slim hands dramatically
472 high as if describing anguish and great tension...
Eyes traveling on,
473 she nearly burst out laughing at the comical faces of a group who had
474 just walked in.  They clustered together, stock still & wide-eyed,
475 with utterly bewildered looks.  "What is it?" whispered one; another
476 just wordlessly shook his head.  Alex, having come in behind them,
477 slipped quietly around the befuddled group, noting their expressions
478 with a sidelong look, but he couldn't quite conceal the grin that 
479 chased across his face as he wound his way through the crowd.  
Cloth
480 obstructed her view as a cloak was flung on the back of chair stationed
481 near the window, and the flame of red caught her attention:  a monogram
482 stitched into the breast "IS"--and she glanced straight up into the 
483 grey eyes of its owner!  He made a gesture as if to speak, but suddenly
484 there was a commotion by the front door--"Its Pam!"
The rippled reaction
485 dashed through the crowd, and all eyes turned towards her, for she was
486 a sight to behold!  Her face was aglow and her hair was finally loose,
487 and the shining tresses that reached nearly to her waist were nothing
488 short of breathtaking!  Upon her shoulder was a fire lizard of royal
489 hue, chattering excitedly, flashing out his wings to maintain his
490 balance as she strode in the entrance.  
"So that is why!" murmured the
491 girl as she keenly enjoyed the distraction.  "I hope Daon wasn't a
492 nuisance, the way he's clinging to her as if she were going to escape!"
493 No longer unsure, she entered the Inn like a whisper, and melted into
494 the background contentedly to enjoy the unique entertainment of the Inn.

496 ================================================================
497    Several of the lurkers in the shadows picked up their ears.
498 The apperentice, the piper and the bard were speaking in soft
499 tones, but a word was spoken slightly too loudly.
500   The apprentice, spoke just a trifle too loudly and asked the 
501 bard about the Gostak.  The piper repeated it, and mentioned the
502 Doshes!  Heads turned.  The merry atmosphere took on an air of 
503 tension!
504   Hands loosed daggers in their sheaths.  Tension was building, 
505 and whispers passed through two opposed groups.
506 
507    One patron, far gone in his cups muttered
508    "The Gostak distimms the Doshes..."
509 
510 Silence fell for a moment.
511 
512   "Heresy!" muttered another drunken patron.
513 ============================dusty===============================
514 She who is happy wears seven league boots  +++ I.S. +++
515 ===============================================================
516 	"Pam!"	The word cut through the conversation like a knife. He
517 looked up and saw her by the door. Ah! Now THAT is how a witch should look.
518 Not like those drawings he had seen, of old withered crones, but bright and 
519 cheerful, full of life. Ah, yes. Glinda the Good, not the 'Wicked Witch of the
520 West'. It was strange, but none of the witches he knew looked anything like what
521 common folk seemed to expect.
522 	My, this is going to be quite a day, he thought after spying d. He did not have
523 to try to avoid drawing attention to her for long, however. It seemed that a
524 chance remark of the bard had drawn an astonishing amount of interest. Quickly, 
525 he spoke, "Gostaks and doshes, distimming? By the Lady! Please Sir, I beg you,
526 do not resurrect that old feud. It has been debated by far better than any here."
527 	Continuing, "As for MY opinion, I am but a humble apprentice. Surely thou 
528 knowest that apprentices have no opinions. Such tend to result in tender 
529 backsides, sir!" Amid laughter he reseated himself. Inwardly, he was trembling. 
530 Smaller things than that had caused fights he had no wish to see the likes of
531 again. Most especially, not in the Inn!

564      A YOUNG DRAGON CIRCLES, THEN PERCHES UPON MY SHOULDER, FLUTTERING IN A
565 GRACEFUL MANNER, AND MY SPIRITS LIFT EVEN HIGHER!  JOY, GOOD FRIEND d MUST
566 BE HERE!  I WILL SEARCH HER OUT AT FIRST OPPORTUNITY, AS I KNOW THAT SHE
567 WILL NOT BE APPARENT AT FIRST GLANCE.  AH, SHY AND UNOBTRUSIVE, WELL DO I
568 KNOW THOSE MANNERS!  THEY HAVE BEEN MY COMPANIONS FOR MANY YEARS, AND THOUGH
569 I SEEK TO BREAK FROM THEIR HOLD, THEY STILL DOMINATE ME MORE THAN I WOULD
570 WISH.
571 
572      AS I ENTER THE INN, THE LEVEL OF COMMOTION IS HIGH.  IT APPEARS THAT
573 THERE IS AN HEATED DISCUSSION OF GOSTAKS AND DOSHES, ONE WHICH THE YOUNG
574 APPRENTICE TRIES TO STEM.  HE IS WISE, SUCH AS THAT COULD RUIN THE MOOD OF
575 THE INN, AND PERHAPS RUIN SOME FURNITURE IN THE BARGAIN.  PASSING THE SAVAGE
576 ARGUMENT BY, I APPROACH THE APPRENTICE, AND I NOTICE THAT HE IS AWARE OF MY
577 ENTRANCE.
578 
579      "WELL, I FIND YOU AGAIN HERE, AND I HOPE THAT YOU FIND ME HERE BUT IN
580 BETTER FORM THAN BEFORE!" I TEASE.  "WE MUST TALK AGAIN OVER TEA, NOW THAT I
581 MAY SPEAK WITH A LESS TROUBLED MIEN.  I HAVE ONE OTHER I MUST SEE NOW, FOR
582 SHE HAS BEEN AWAY LONG AND I HAVE FELT THE LOSS MOST SEVERELY, BUT YOU CAN
583 BE ASSURED THAT YOU WON'T ESCAPE MY TONGUE IN THE FUTURE!"
584 
585      PLAYFULLY, I TUG HIS BEARD, KISS HIS CHEEK, AND SPIN AWAY LAUGHING.  I
586 KNOW SHE IS HERE, BUT WHERE?  MY EYES SEARCH THE CROWD OVER, BUT I FAIL TO
587 SEE HER.  THERE IS A TUG AT MY SHOULDER, AND I LOOK TO SEE THE YOUNG DRAGON
588 IS TRYING TO PULL ME TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE INN, TO MY USUAL PLACE.  I LET
589 HIM GUIDE ME (HIM?  HER?  I'M AFRAID THAT I AM UNABLE TO TELL!), AND HE IS A
590 GOOD SHEPHERD, AS THERE IS d WAITING AT MY USUAL TABLE.  SHE RISES, AND I
591 EMBRACE HER AS THOUGH SHE WAS LOST AND FOUND AGAIN.  I THINK WE WILL SPEAK
592 FOR A GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME THIS EVE!

598 He looks at his watch, as if in a trance, while he crosses the bridge.
599 Perhaps the Inn is uncrowded at this time.
Untrue !!!
600 The inn is bursting at the seams with patrons.  In his three piece
601 suit, white shirt and a tie, he doesn't fit at the Inn.   Perhaps a
602 back door exists, and he can sneak in and leave his message.
603 He spies a side door, and slips in.  The days when he came in the front
604 door, brash and full of argument, are gone for a time.  This new
605 character (old character?) of the inn is not within the abilities of
606 a common Business Analyst.
607 He looks about, and spies PAM, talking softly with d in the back of the
608 Inn.  Now a chance, I know that Pam will be cleaning this table soon, and
609 perchance will see this message if I just leave it here.  He opens the note
610 and reads through it, seeing if it is the right slip of paper.
611 It is.  "I am still around, let's talk later. - DJJ". He folds and sets it down.

616 SHIP FOR GOOD.  WELL, BWMS IS A VERY CHANGEABLE BEAST, AND WILL CHANGE OF
617 ITS OWN ACCORD.  DON'T WORRY, THE DEBATES WILL RETURN AT SOME FUTURE TIME,
618 THOUGH WHEN I REALLY CAN'T SAY (OR WANT TO).  IT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT
619 THING TO TRY TO DIRECT THE CONVERSATION ON BWMS, AND THE BEST THING IS TO
620 JUST JOIN IN.  I DID, AND I HAD A LOT OF FUN IN THE PROCESS.
621 
622      I REMEMBER WHEN OUR DEBATING SOCIETY WAS IN FULL FORCE, AND THE COM-
623 PLAINTS ABOUT "LACK OF IMAGINATION" ECHOED THROUGHOUT THE LAND.  NOW THAT BW
624 IS IN A FANTASY MODE, WE HEAR FROM SOME THAT IT'S "WEIRD" HERE.  MARK TWAIN
625 WAS WRONG, YOU CAN'T SATISFY ALL OF THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME.  YOU CAN'T
626 SATISFY ALL OF THE PEOPLE ANY OF THE TIME!  I'M ALMOST OUT OF SPACE, SO A
