21   From Prometheus: Overwhelmed
22   I give my thanks to everyone who has given me any advice on my writing. I greatly appreciate it, and do hope that it will
23 continue.
24   I am not offended in the least by what people have said. Since I first started using this BW I have wanted that sort of help
25 and this is time that I haven't had to pin someone down to telling me.
26   I enjoy hearing polite advice on correcting most things about myself. I need it.
27   And to CDP I apologize very sincerely, please don't hold any of it againnst me. No hard feelings?
28   Hoping to correct my spelling, grammar, and sentence structure problems; I am taking about ten hours of english studies per
29 week. Thank you for advising some goals for me to work for.
30   As I said, please continue. And if anybody cares to tell me, how am I doing as far as being mature?
31                                                                                                                               
32   Controllers; Withh the next major rewrite of my terminal program, I shall have null capabilities [read; Tonight.]
33 Why have you not entered anything for about three weeks. Mayhaps you are gone?
34   Man IGray; Care to see an extensive article on the MC68020? If so; I still frequent PCS- CBBS.
35   To Whom It May Concern; I AM AT THE TOP.Only the second time I have ever done this, and it is quite pleasant.
36   PorSFiS attendees; I got down to PC+S at about 17:30 and found; no one. Too bad. Try again in two weeks.
37   Traveller; Have you adopted another title or are you gone for good? Lack of reply will be taken as "GONE FOR GOOD"

52 BAD:explane to me then, if violence is not the nature of man, why there is so
53 much of it around? Why, when faced with conflict, does the avarage teenager
54 fight rather then reason? And the most important question, how do I hook up
55 my new DAA to my modem?

69      I don't believe that a person can judge human nature by only pointing to
70 a specific person or group of people. Your example of the average teenager 
71 could easily be countered with 'lack of experiential data on how to deal with
72 conflict situations', or 'inability to negotiate due to lack of maturity' or
73 some other drivel equally debatable.
74      My view is split. On a biological level, I believe that we pretty much 
75 have the same flight-or-fight patterns that you see in all the higher primates.
76 When you go into areas of sociology or psychology for the answer, the path
77 becomes more intune with philosophy or religion. There is no quantitative test
78 for 'good' or 'evil'. A person's sense of these factors is social. In our 
79 culture cannabalism is strictly taboo. In some South American cultures the
80 dead are honored by having bones their ground-up and made into soup! Which
81 of these exemplifies the good side of human and which the bad? Well both and 
82 neither. The South American would probably quite amazed that we do not 'honor'
83 our dead, but I doubt that I would serve up my grandmother for Sunday brunch.
84 I think that a person's view of the 'goodness' or 'badness' of human nature
85 depends more on the individual's outlook on life more than anything. I haven't
86 meet any optimistic people that feel that other people are inherently bad, but
87 I have met a lot of people the think the life is a bitch, and that everyone 
88 else are real bastards. I like to count myself in the first group. Granted,
89 there are alot of problems to deal with, and a alot of things that just plain
90 piss me off. But, these are not, I believe, inbred flaws in human nature.
91 They are mostly transitory in nature and will, with time, be reconciled (of
92 course to be replaced by problems we can't even imagine yet).

97   Well, maybe I won't have nulls tonight after all, hmm, okay, does this work?
98   No, I am going to rot in a corner with my computer for a while and thuroughly

106 L'homme - losing two out of three feels about 2/3s as bad as losing all.
107 Why don't you tell us how THAT feels?
108 Regarding the chips, the only place I've been informed of availability is
109 Portland Radio downtown and Norvac in Beaverton.  I don't want to go clear
110 out to Beaverton, but downtown is almost as bad.  If I can't come up with some
111 place better (read that closer to Milwaukie), I'll probably end up going 
112 downtown.  Sure wish Radio Shack still carried IC's.
113 ??
114 Given the current topic of discussion here lately (the fine art of writing
115 {including grammar and spelling}), I wouldn't be surprised to see
116 SPELL ALERT rear his/her ugly head again.  It somehow seems apropo.
117 ??
118 Prometheus - you've committed yourself now.  As long as you didn't ask for
119 advice, you could make what mistakes you wanted and if anyone complained, 
120 claim ignorance.  Now, however, you are on record as having asked for and
121 received advice.  If you screw up now, it's ALL YOUR FAULT.
122 On the other hand, if you properly apply the suggestions, your writing will
123 come out quite well, and I think you will probably qualify for "most improved"
124 (comparing that with your early entries here on Back Water).

128     I don't know what chips your looking for, but I would suggest you
129 call Hamilton-Avnet. They do a very brisk business in problem chips and
130 I've never had a problem getting anything from them non-prepaid. Try'em
131 they're very friendly.

152 Pendergrass - what you entered has probably been rotated to drive B.
153 Type   DB  and you can look for it there.
154 CDP - I'm looking for TTL like 74LS153 and 74LS166.  Since those are the only
155 two I need right now, it hardly seems practical to mail-order them.  I'd like
156 to find some place local, and save the mail-order for when the cost of the 
157 chips is greater than the shipping/handling.
158 Any local options?

163 on his feet and still hasn't figured out which end has the spigot on it, but
164 the poor little critter has packed a lifetime into just a few hours.  The new
165 little bull calf needs a name ... my 4-year old is holding out for "Cow Meat"
166 with occasional giggles.  I was thinking of "Tenderloin".  (I've used up 
167 T-Bone and Sirloin) Any suggestions?
168 Oh dread! then the fun job of converting little bull calf to steer calf. Ugh!

185 QuizMaster : I look at it with a philosophical eye. What is victory?  Can it
186 merely be equated with some abusrd quantum such as number of pie pieces? Can
187 you say with any conviction that to win is everything, ergo losing is nothing?
188 I think not, and in my current frame of mind, bending far from that needed to
189 extract small facts from deep within my memory, winning and losing seem to
190 meld into one ambigious thought. The current state of affairs point to a far
191 more important activity. While winning and losing have lost some of their
192 luster, playing has grown in importance. I submit a small rewrite of the old
193 cliche': "It's not whether you win or lose, it's IF you play the game."
194 Before you spend your hard-earned dollars on TTL, try to get ahold of me. I
195 may be able to save you some effort, as well as some money. Hopefully, if
196 other things go right, we can talk in person. Is that is not to be, then I
197 guess secondary communications via the telephone will have to suffice. Also,
198 recent events have clouded the picture on certain computer related social
199 events. Perhaps you can return to the days of old, and give me a little well-
200 meaning advice. Right now, I know where my priorities stand, but I would hate
201 to forfiet possible contacts due to some other unforseen possibilities.

204 L'homme - that was so ambiguous you even lost me.
205 Mikey - Radar no longer carries such items.  I was there a couple of weeks
206 ago looking for 74LS02, 20, and 373.  They only had the 02, which they Gave
207 to me since they were clearing them out.  I hate to drive to Beaverton since
208 my car is unreliable, gets 13 mpg, and is so loud it often attracts unwanted
209 attention (and I can't afford any more trouble with the cops/DMV).

219 Quizmaster:I will look and see if I have the LSXXX you need, if not... there are
220 other ways to get them without going to the actual point of buying them(uhg!)
221 CDP:My original point was that violence is the normal way that most people
222 respond to any given situation. The term "most people" will certainly get me in
223 trouble here, because BW goers are NOT at all normal. Case in point, I was 
224 driving home last night at about 4A.M. from downtown portland and found a lady 
225 and her kid stranded on the side of the road, this was on I84, so it was kind of
226 hard to stop and go back. I had every intention of doing so when I saw what 
227 appeared to be the cars driver walking along the side of the road with a gas can
228 . This time I was able to stop and gave her a ride back to the car, helped her 
229 fix her car and get running again. All fine and dandy fut when I left I saw her
230 get out and start pounding on the hood and yell what I am sure were not nice 
231 things. Why did she do this? why not get going and look upon it as a learning
232 experience to keep her car in shape? Violence is human nature. Some of us can 
233 rise above it most of the time, but it is still human nature. This applies to 
234 everyone.
235 I think that she was qualified as "most people".

288 ENERGY INTO THE DARKEST CORNERS. I COULD SEE MANY EYES STARING AT ME FROM
289 THE BACK OF THE CAVE AND I KNEW THEY BELONGED TO THE CHILDREN OF TRUTH.
290 I CALLED OUT, "YES, IT IS ME, DON'T BE FRIGHTENED LITTLE ONES". I COULD

293 WATCHED THEM JUMP UP AND DOWN IN EXCITEMENT. THEY LOOKED LIKE WAVES

295 THEY HAD SO MANY ANSWERES TO TELL ME THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO
296 BEGIN.

298 I ANSWERED, "YES, I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE UNCERTAIN STRANGER IS.".
299 ONE BLUE CHILD WHO ONLY LOOKED FOUR ANSWERES THE TRUTH. "YES, THE
300 UNCERTAIN STRANGER IS VERY NEAR AND YOU WILL HAVE AN ENCOUNTER WITH
301 HER SOON. HER??? COULD THE UNCERTAIN STRANGER BE A FEMALE TYPE?????
302 I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS AT ALL. I FELT AN UNFAMILIAR URGE REACH OUT
303 FROM MY BODY. I HAD ONCE WATCHED THE RIVER OF DREAMS DREAM OF A WOMAN
304 AND IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DREAMS. I HAD KEPT THE DREAM LOCKED IN
305 MY HEART FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. COULD THIS UNCERTAIN STRANGER HAVE THE

308 MY MIND WAS IN DISC DRIVE WHEN A CHILD OF BLUE CALLED OUT. "YES, YOU WILL
309 FIND THE UNCERTAIN STRANGER TONIGHT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE BLUE CANYONS."
310 MY HEART GAVE OUT A LITTLE SKIP AND I REPLIED, "YES, I AM MORE THAN
311 GRATEFULL FOR YOUR HONEST AND TRUE HELP". THE CHILDREN WERE NOW BOBBING
312 LIKE APPLES WITH EXCITEMENT AND I KNEW I WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO THE CAVE

338    Milchar -- I would not claim relationship with Lassie (the 4-footed bovine,
339 not my choice of names) although she is a very nice cow-person.  Now that the
340 new arrival has dried off, I find that being a surgeon is not necessary ths
341 time round.  What I thought at first glance was a baby bull's equipment was
342 a knot of fur.  Now that the waterworks are working, that misconception has
343 been alleviated.  My daughter has officially announced that the name of the
344 calf will be Sweetmeat.  I must choose what the calf's destiny will be --
345 do I need another milk animal or to fill the freezer?  Enough -- I just thought

350      I could point to hundreds of cases where the individual didn't
351 get violent because their car broke. Upset yes, but not violent.
352 Your argument reminds me of the typical religous argument. If you
353 look around long enough, you can find any kind of example you want.
354 But that hardly makes it the norm. There is a difference between
355 anger and violence. It is normal to get angry when things don't go
356 right. But I woud disagree with you that violence is the normal
357 outcome.
358 Lazza-fair
359      I also disagree with you that man is a destructive creature
360 If that were true, he would never have gotten to where he is
361 today. Instead he would still be attacking each other with rocks
362 and bones. destruction is not a positive instinct. Man has shown
363 thruout his history his desire to dominate, not destroy. There's
364 a big difference. In the case of wars, detruction does happen, but
365 it is not as a result of wanton desire to destroy, but simply as
366 a side result of the main goal of dominating the enemy. And in
367 fact the destruction is is carefully chosen to achieve that goal,
368 not to just do it at random.

Geeez! I've been gone and missed some great hoopla it would appear. Sorry
381 i took so long on the line but I've no drive. SIGH! CDP - If it seems I've
382 singled you out or some such, that is not the case. I just got up on my soap
383 box and got carried away. One of the raesons I usually avoid religous and 
384 politcal debates. My apologies to one and all for any slights you may have
385 felt were flung your way. Well, work reality beckons (practicly tugging at
386 my sleeve!) so I must go.

390 This is 'The Phantom' speaking.  I am new to this system, but so far
391 it seems to be a nice one. (No multiple menus, no complex commands,
392 everything is kept simple.)  I'd like to hear from all you Apple hackers
393 who know of an Apple user group in the Beaverton area.  Also, does anyone
394 know what the #$^% happened to the Bit Bucket??  I can never get thru
395 to it.  Perhaps the line is just busy, but I call during the most unusual
396 hours.  Help me!  I'm also interested in finding a few new boards to call.
397 The ones I have contacted are listed below:
398  
399            CBBS/NW             646-xxxx

421       If you are going to aurgue predeterminizime be careful. You are on
422 the same shaky ground that most organized religion has been for the last
423 2 thousand years ( original sin and all that rot ).
424       If your going to aurgue a biological I suggest you roll out the
425 names of some geneticists that have shown where the genes are that cause
426 this phenomenon.

445 QuizMaster : 340! Wow! You must have done some real work after I gave you all
446   of those hints. B.T., R.G., K.B. etc., eat your collective twit hearts out!
447   I talked to Gage today, and thanked him again for his hosting of the great
448   T.P. fest.
449   I talked to our favorite advice person today, and she had quite a bit to say.
450   I have some interesting news for you, which I should tell you thru alternate
451   means.
452 Laz: Yes...Mondale I must admit was quite decent about the Beruit attack. His
453  "President Reagan speaks for ALL Americans..." was a refreshing change from
454  the normal political "campain" rhetoric.
455 Alex : Welcome back! What is this talk about Vile Amber Liquid? Research has
456  shown that the orange color and its peculiar molecualar reactions with 
457  irridated reagents and UV light cause many of the side effects known to
458  occur quickly after human ingestion of VOL. How was your vacation?
459 Ian : What's this? Has our exhaulted NET leader made a comeback? As you well
460  know, several of your operatives are in mothballs in Rajneesh, waiting for
461  the resurrection of the famous Rajneesh Dangerfield story line. In light of
462  recent events in our own humble little state, perhaps it is time to check
463  in with our patient agents and the goings-on in southern Oregon?
464 All : Just some observations on my first day back at school after a 4 month
465  vacation after three straight years sans vacation:
466 
467 Those poor freshmen. You can spot them a mile away. They are the ones
468 carrying three bags full of books. They are the ones who can't open their
469 lockers, and they are the ones who stand up with a blank look on their face
470 halfway through a lecture on applied linear algebra, and say to all, "Isn't
471 this writing 121?"
472 
473 The wavos and trendies. You can spot them 1/4 mile away. They are the
474 ones who are wearing the current MTV fashions. They are the ones who's gender
475 is sometimes not determinable at first glance. They are the ones who always
476 seem to have the sea of students part for them as they walk like Moses from
477 one class to another.
478 
479 The jocks. You had better spot them ASAP. They are the ones who's necks
480 seems to start at the hair line and continue downward. They are the ones who
481 never seem to quite get into the groove as far as scholastic achievement goes.
482 They are the ones who sound like semi-brain damaged cannary workers when
483 intelligent conversation is foolishy attempted. And they are the ones who
484 maybe perhaps if the gods are willing will earn the football team a .500
485 record this year.
486 
487 The EE students. You don't have to worry about spotting them in
488 advance, they are all over the place anyway. They are the ones who carry
489 briefcases with PeeChees inside. They are the ones who own 40% of all HP41C?s
490 ever built. They are the ones who are enthralled by running canned FORTRAN
491 programs on the HoneyWell. And they are the ones who are slowly taking over
492 that last bastion of hi-tek in downtown Portland, the PCAT building, better
493 known as the Portland Center for Advanced Technology, of which IBM stole the
494 last two initials for use on their newest PC.
495 
496 The seniors. Ah yes, the seniors. I better do some more research
497 into this one. I wouldn't want to make any brash stereotypical statements
498 without first giving everything some real thought now, would I?

503    L'Homme -- Lockers?  You said lockers?  My god, the last time I had to 
504 deal with a locker was in high school -- more years ago than I want to re-
505 member.  Pray tell, is the center of learning to which  you are returning 
506 one monolithic structure, a number of closely related buildings, or what?
507    General observation -- hey is there anyone who can make a case for Original
508 Sin?  At one time there were several vociferous Christians stopping at the
509 Inn, but since the religious debates have died down, I lost track of who is
510 practicing this particular religion.  As far as I know, this concept is unique
511 to Christianaty -- you are dammned from birth due to inhereted transgressions
512 -- sins that you did not commit, but are nontheless responsible for.  As far
513 as I know, most other religions let you at least do something before dammning
514 you for it.  Christians -- any comments?  Other religions -- any replys?
515 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
516 
517 L'Homme---Ah, youth!  Would that I were once again treading the halls of 
518 learning.  Once again, you have let slip your identity, and revealed your 
519 magnificent disinclination to tolerance and forebearance.  There, but for 
520 the grace of God, went yourself once!

523 ORIGINAL SIN? HMMMMMM, IT'S RELIGION SO I THINK I'LL JUST SAY THIS: WHO'S
524 IDEA WAS IT THAT A SIN WAS COMMITED? AFTER ALL, WE COULD SAY THAT EVE WAS A
525 VICTIM OF COERCION AND THAT ADAM WAS AN UNWITTING ACCOMPLICE. THAT'S IF WE
526 USE THE "MODERN" ERA CONTEXT. IN THOSE DAYS, SIN WAS SIN! YOU DID IT! NOW
527 PAY PENNANCE! AND WE ARE STILL CHASING THE SAME TAIL. PEOPLE STILL TRY TO
528 TELL OTHERS THAT THEIR WAY IS THE ONLY ONE AND WE WILL ALL BE BURNING IN
529 HELL FOR NOT BEING OF THE PROPER FAITH AND ETC, ETC, ETC.... I PREFER TO
530 LET EACH HUMAN BEING DO AS HE PLEASES SO LONG AS IT DOES NOT GO AGAINST
531 THE ACCEPTED TENETS OF SOCIETY AS WE NOW KNOW IT. IF WE KEEP UP THIS LITTLE
532 CHARADE LONG ENOUGH WE BURN THIS LITTLE DUSTBALL CALLED EARTH UP TO A CHAR

550 What is SIN?  Almost anything you can come up with is merely a transgression
551 against mankind's laws.  The only tue sin is that which infringes upon or 
552 hurts another member of the cosmos.
553 There may be things we do that are in conflict with the rules of decency, 
554 or propriety, but the only SIN we commit is that which causes hurt.

561 MEMBER OF THE COSMOS IS ALL FINE AND WELL, BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE "DECENT"
562 THING ISN'T DONE? WHO PAYS THE PRICE FOR ANOTHERS LACK OF CONCERN OF WHAT
563 BELONGS TO WHOM? SOME WOULD SAY IT' THE DEED THAT COUNTS NOT THE THOUGHT,
564 AND OTHERS WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT IT' THE THOUGHT TAHT COUNTS, NOT THE
565 DEED. OR TO PUT IT MORE CONCISELY: WHICH CAME FIRST, THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG?

574 characters (and cursor) back again. (not to mention getting to put
575 my computer back together - right now it looks as if I was living out
576 near MHCC).  Perhaps you can get SOMEONE interested in taking Petrov's place?

578 Riskers - how's Friday look? We can all ooooh and aaaw over L'hommes new wheels.
579 Hmmm...if it were not for mans inherently violent nature, games such as
580 Risk and Sudden Death's Survival Game would not exist. Civilization has
