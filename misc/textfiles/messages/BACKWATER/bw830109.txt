5 GENERAL DISCLAIMER: BWMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION PLACED ON
6                     THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privatly owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system.
10 It is intended that the system be normally used for messages and
11 advertisments by the users. As the system is privatly owned, I retain the
12 right to remove any and all messages from the system which are offensive
13 to me. Additionally because of the limited size of the system, it will be
14 periodically purged of older messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
15 The saved information will be cycled to drive 'B' while the information on
16 drive 'B' will be archived, and a fresh disk will be installed in drive 'A'.
17 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out
18 of the enter mode. The message is automaticly stored.
19 If after entering the message you find you made a mistake,
20 use the replace command to replace the line.
21 To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
22 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.
23 ========================================
24 Sorry about that, anyway here's a new disk for ya.
25 It seems that the usage of the system has gone up 
26 radically of late, like befor I was having to change
27 disks about once every month or two. It is now less 
28 then two weeks befor the drive overflows. 
29 ++ I'm popular!!!! ++ 
30 To those of you who have left comments in regard to me and
31 the system, THANK YOU. 
32 It is nice to know you are apperciated (yes, I know it is
33 spelled wrong, but what else is new?).
34 In regard to my pervious comment on FLEX/OS9. I do not
35 change my feelings in regard to these operating systems.
36 It is not that they are bad per sa, but rather I find
37 that CP/M (which I use) to be far better for my needs.
38 Anouther point I might make is that I cut my hardware teeth
39 on the 6502 (Original engineering sample - no rotate right
40 and a bug on branching over page bounderies). I still like the
41 6502, and infact there are some things that the 6502 can do
42 faster then any other MOS processor (yes even the 8088!).
43 (Please compare proper technologies here.
44  Take a look at the clock timing charts.
45 8080-8085-Z80 JMP - 10 clocks    6502 JMP - 3 clocks
46 8080-8085-Z80 NOP - 4 clocks     6502 NOP - 2 clocks.)
47 Assuming a top speed Z80B, at 6Mhz (P.S. a 6Mhz 8085 has a
48 real internal clock rate of 3Mhz.) compared to a 3Mhz 6502B
49 we can run even or better on the most used instructions.
50 and with the 6502C at 4Mhz it's faster.
51 Accually, the real test of how good a proccesor is at speed
52 is how efficent it is at accessing its memory. If if processor
53 accesses its memory at the fastest possible rate, that is all
54 the speed it needs. (It is pointless to crunch the data faster
55 and then just sit there waiting for the memory to give you the 
56 next instruction.)
57 Anyway, I use a Z80 now running CPM. This is because it is more
58 suitable to the things I am doing, and the information base
59 is far far larger for 8080/Z80 stuff of the sort I need.
60 So although I like the 6502, I use the Z80 because it gets
61 the job done.
62 *** YET EVEN MORE VERBAGE FROM CISTOP MIKEY **** 22 DEC 82 ******
63 ADAM,
64 THANKS FOR COMMENTS, YES, THE LINKASM DOES SUPPORT SYMBOLS
65 BY TYPING THE DRIVE NAME AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE (LINKASM TEST.AAZ A:)
66 AS TO IF IT WILL WORK WITH SID, I DON'T KNOW AS I HAVE NOT TRIED
67 IT. ALTHOUGH SINCE WARD SAYS IT DOES I WOULD SAY IT IS A VERY GOOD
68 BET THAT IT DOES (JUST GOT MY COPY OF CBBS, AND HE TALKS ABOUT IT
69 IN THERE SAYING THAT HE ADDED THE SYM FEATURE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT
70 REASON!). I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A NEWER VERSION OF LINKASM OUT,
71 DID IT COME WITH THE SOURCE? I HAVE BEEN POKING AROUND IN IT TO
72 SEE IF I COULD MODIFY IT TO ASSEMBLE ACROSS DRIVES, BUT IT WOULD
73 BE EASIER TO DO IT FROM THE SOURCE OF COURSE. P.S. AMODEM2 IS
74 COMMING ALONG FAIRLY WELL THE DIRECTORY DIAL IS NICE! STILL GOT A
75 BUG SOMEWHERE THAT CAUSES IT TO BLOW ON EXCESSIVE ERRORS. HOPEFULLY
76 I CAN FIX IT IN TIME TO RELEASE IN JAN LIKE I SAID I WOULD.

133 HOW about some atari users adding a   few messages here.

135 true.

137 
138 Just a point of note: The 8088 jmp takes 14 clock cycles to perform
139 The 8080/8085/Z80 jmp takes 10 clock cycles, and the 6502 jmp takes
140 3 clock cycles. A simple register to register move takes 2 clock
141 cycles in the 8088, 4 clocks in the 8080/8085/Z80 and 2 clocks in
142 the 6502.
143 It would seem to me that this 8 year old micro can still hold its own
144 ground against the lastest and greatest and at a heck of a lower cost.
145 So why do I continue to use a Z80? probably because there is far and
146 away more software available for my needs that needs a 8080/Z80 to run.
147 **** MORE RAMBLINGS FROM CISTOP MIKEY **** 24 DEC 82 **************
148 
149 
150 HOW ABOUT USING THIS SERVICE TO TRANSFER SOME REAL INFORMATION INSTEAD
151 OF REACTIONARY BULLSHIT. LORD KNOWS IT'S HARD LEARNING TO USE ONE OF
152 THESE DAMN BOXES.
153 I HAVE AN OSBORNE. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN ATARI ALSO, HOWEVER, JUST
154 BECAUSE THE GAMES ARE SO INCREDIBLE. SCRAM IS THE MOST REALISTIC SIM-
155 ULATION I HAVE SEEN OF A NUCLEAR PLANT. AS A FORMER OPERATOR AT TROJAN
156 I FEEL I CAN CLAIM SOME EXPERTISE. THE ENERGY CZAR GAME IS EXTRAOR-
157 DINARY ALSO. IF THE COMPUTER CAN SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT SOPHISTICATED,
158 IT MUST HAVE A FEW THINGS GOING FOR IT.
159 ANOTHER TOPIC. WHY IS THERE SO MUCH VARIATION BETWEEN RCP/M'S. THE 
160 BEAVERTON ONE SEEMS WELL RUN AND HAS LOTS OF CAPACITY, BUT THEY DON'T
161 HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT OLYCPM OR THE MISSAUGA
162 CPM IN CANADA HAS.  ARE OREGON RESIDENTS JUST NOT PARTICIPATING?  
163 A LIKELY REASON, SINCE THAT IS THE SOURCE OF PROGRAMS.
164 
165 
166 *************************************************************:
167 Well, I for one have contributed! In fact, you will find a whole
168 section of the Beaver town RCPM dedicated to my programs. Admittedly,
169 the major share of them are from my AMODEM series. There are a number
170 of reasons for the current state of the system. The system is rather new,
171 and the CPM users group here is rather active. (Why waist time pulling
172 the program over the phone lines when you can go to a meeting and get
173 a copy free.) As a result only things that are of immediate interest
174 seem to get there. (This does not mean new, lots of old stuff there of
175 interest. I just pulled the Z80 resource off it myself recently which has
176 been around for a while, but I only recently had a need.) I kind of view
177 it as a remote data base for programs I may need sometime. (Why yank
178 stuff off it if I don't need it? I got enough full disks as it is!)
179 It is indeed a very neat system (as opposed to BWMS which is just strange!)

195 Anybody out there that is rich, and doesn't want to stay that way
196 should go out and buy a 212 type modem; and then call CBBS
197 on xxx-xxxx with it. Just try to read the message headers when
198 you scan them at 1200 baud. Messages are great to "R" though;
199 no waiting at all. 
200    Mike, be sure not to do it to this system: it is hard enough
201 to take this tripe without it coming at you 4 times as fast.

218 Following is what is confirmed on the release of the new Atari 1200XL.
219 First, note that this new machine is strictly a marketing and production
220 ploy: Atari needs a fresh machine to promote and the new model is cheaper 
221 to produce.  Actually, the 800 appears the preferred model now.
222 64k, 2 joysticks, sealed unit.  No expansion, no access.  One cartridge
223 slot on side. Self diagnostics. 256 colors with 15 -count 'em - fifteed
224 graphics modes! (so the OS now supports ANTIC modes 4,5, and 15.)
225 One serial port, apparently not RS 232.
226 No mention made of printer port.
227 Memo pad mode eliminated.
228 Rest is cosmetics or minor features such as four function keys intended for
229 applications programmers to define in their software.  Help key is RAM
230 vectored so programmers can do what they will with it.

246 *************** 12/29/82  2:22PM ******************
247 There is a new system to spread the word on.  It is
248 called the BIT BUCKET.  It is BRAND NEW, and still
249 may have bugs.  Right now it is kind of limited, but
250 I plan future expansion.  Hours will be variable, so
251 if you don't get any response, assume that it is down
252 for enhancements/bug fixes/personal system use.
253 Data rate is 300 baud.  Phone is xxx-xxxx.  Once modems
254 hook together, hit two RETURN's, and things will start
255 up.  Have fun.   The BIT BUCKET.

281 MESSAGE TO ALL: THE TI99/4 IS A REAL PILE. IT IS A TOTAL WASTE
282                 OF MONEY. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER.
283                 THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPUTERS THAT ARE FAR MORE
284                 POWERFUL FOR THE SAME MONEY, OR A LITTLE

286                 FROM TERRIBLE INSTRUMENTS?
287 
288 Actually the TI-99/4a is pretty nifty machine.  The problem is with TI.
289 Texas Inst. computer division (as apposed to the printer and parts division)
290 really does believe: "We don't care, we don't have to...".  Even if they change
291 their tune, and there is some evidence they are trying, it may be too late.
292 Too bad, really, the '99 has got some great potential.

297 Actually, I agree with PG about the TI.
298 It isn't really a BAD machine... it just
299 could be better.  If you are looking for
300 a good cheap computer, you should also
301 consider the Atari 400 or the VIC 20.   
302 The Timex/Sinclair ZX81 is interesting,
303 except for the keyboard, and for $79.95
304 (lowest price I saw during Xmas), you
305 can't go wrong.

367 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
368 I KNOW THIS BBS IS STRANGE, BUT IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE.
369 HUH?!!!!!!!!!
370 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
371 TO ALL: I THINK THE TI HAS TO MANY DOWNFALLS - FOR ITS PRICE.
372 IT HAS A sTRANGE PROCESSOR (ONE OF THE 9900 FAMILY)
373 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ISN'T VERY WELL SUPPORTED BY OTHER
374 COMPANIES BECAUSE OF: 1.WEIRD PROCESSOR  2.TI DOESN'T
375 PROMOTE OTHER COMPANIES DEVELOPEMENT OF SOFTWARE AND/OR
376 HARDWARE FOR THIS COMPUTER.
377 IT DOES HAVE POTENTIAL (I.E. BECAUSE OF ITS HARDWARE FEATURES)
378 
379 BUT IN TODAY'S MARKET, A COMPUTER MUST BE WELL SUPPORTED BY
380 HARDWARE/SOFTWARE - AND TI DOESN'T PROMOTE THIS IN THE LEAST.
381 
382 ANOTHER THING- - THE TI99/4A'S KEYBOARD IS ONE OF THE MOST 
383 DIFFICULT TO TYPE ON (EXCEPT FOR THE MEMBRANE KEYBOARDS)
384 IN ORDER TO USE MOST OF THE FUNCTION KEYS, E.G. BACKSPACE - ETC.
385 YOU MUST FIRST HOLD DOWN EITHER THE SHIFT OR CONTROL TO USE 
386 THE FUNCTION - IF YOUR'RE PRONE TO MAKING MISTAKES, THIS WOULD
387 GREATLY SLOW YOU DOWN.
388 
389 ALSO, THE BASIC LANGUAGE IS ONE OF THE WORST THAT I HAVE SEEN
390 IT IS VERY FORMAT ORIENTED (IT REQUIRES A SPACE BETWEEN GO
391 AND TO IN THE STATEMENT GOTO!)
392 PERSONALLY, I WOULD NEVER BUY THE COMPUTER FOR 299.00
393 (O.K, 299.00 MINUS 100.00 FACTORY REBATE THAT YOU SEND IN,
394 AND A MONTH OR TWO LATER GET YOUR MONEY)

464 TO: MIKE DAY       FM: ADAM TRENT    DT: 1/4/83    SJ: LINKASM,Z80
465 HI MIKE  -   I picked up the new version of LINKASM (as files
466 LASM.OBJ and LASM.DQC on the Olympia RCPM to the best of my
467 recollection--just happened to stumble on it while long distance
468 browsing.  I would have lusted after the source but, alas, I
469 didn't see it anywhere.  The .DOC is virtually the same as the
470 previous one except for a short preface about the small addition.
471 LASM shows you a running account on the console of each source
472 module as it's handled in both pass one and pass two.  This is
473 convenient -- the only difference I have been able to detect
474 however.  If it isn't on the Beav. RCPM, I'll try to put these
475 two files on the system.  Also, I agree somewhat about Z80 vs
476 9900, 6502, etal.  Actually, as someone who built an 8008 computer
477 in 1974, I may be hopelessly biased.  But, I've never been THAT
478 impressed with the Z80 itself.  The ZILOG architects paid a heavy
479 price for object code compatability with the 8080--if you look 
480 at T-state specs on 8080 vs Z80 (as I did once again recently) 
481 the preselector bytes take a heavy toll.  And I bet there are
482 10 systems running straight 8080 code on the Z80 (ala CP/M-80),
483 NOT using the "full power" of the Z80 for every 1 system that 
484 does use the Z80-unique instructions.  I recently did some 
485 calculations to investigate whether Direct Threaded Code (DTC)
486 had a performance edge over Indirect Threaded Code (ITC) on
487 the 8080.  While doing this I also decided to compare using
488 the Z80 index registers in the inner interpreter of a FORTH I
489 am playing with (on a Z80 KAYPRO).  I concluded that DTC had
490 a 20% performance edge over ITC and that, for the same clock
491 speed, the Z80 had only a marginal 2% to 5% edge over the 8080
492 subset architecture.  True, there is simply more registers and
493 thus more flexibility in the Z80 but for some applications
494 (like threaded interpreters) the advantages don't seem that
495 compelling.  Incidentally, for implementing threaded code,
496 the 6809 is far superior to the Z80.  I wish Motorola had
497 brought out the 6809 at the same time as the Z80 had come out.
498 I would rather see a bigger audience now for the 6809.  They 
499 seem to have cought up somewhat with the 68000.  Unfortunately,
500 market shares gained often overpower architectural elegance
501 for software developers.  1/4/82 - Adam Trent, Black Belt Programmer.
502 
503 P.S.  Still to Mike Day
504 Just called up the Beav. RCPM and sent LASM.DQC and LASM.OBJ to
505 it--you'll find them on A7--Wonder why "SECTION NEWPRGS" doesn
506 t work on the RCPM.   -   A.Trent

531 Adam. I am interested in getting the new LASM, I will be
532 calling RCPM to get it off. (Maybe it will help me figure
533 out the bbeast on my disasembly.) If I get it disassembled 
534 i'll let you know, and possibly put a copy on RCPM.
535 Thanks for the info.

547 My cheepo Signalman modem works beautifully.
548 I'll need to talk to you about doing some file uploads and
549 downloads Whose BB will take them?  Any problem with 80
550 character wide files?  Call me or leave a message on BWMS.
551 Golly gee whiz this is neet!-dan h. xxx-xxxx
552 ** to BIG DAN from Pat Warnishoeiss**
553 Glad you like the micromodem.  Eugene ACE people use many  
554 of them an all are satisfied.  If I did not anticipate BBS
555 use here, that's what I would have bought.  Hayes is nice,h
556 though, except for price.
557 Next month is modem month as theme for PAC meeting.  Please
558 contact Jim Stibik on CBBS so you can report your experiences
559 You're our only signalman that I know of.
560 We can download/upload using Jonesterm.  If you do not have
561 Jonesterm, call me xxx-xxxx and we can probably figure a way
562 to download it to you.
563 Nice to hear from, BIG DAN!!

567 I never considered the Timex/Sinclair a real computer
568 since it can't think and display at the same time,
569 but if the forgoing anouncement was placed there
570 using the timex/Sinclair, I might be inclined to
571 change my mind.  ???
572 *********************************************************
573 Who says the Timex/Sinclair can't think and talk at the same time?
574 (Chewing gum at the same time by the operator is anouther mater thou.)
575 You are probably thinking of the ZX80 of which this was true (unless
576 it has the 8K basic ROM upgrade in it.) What the ZX81 does have is a
577 operation mode which allows the display to be turned off to speed up
578 the computing, but at 300 baud this is hardly needed! In fact a lot of
579 the old ZX80's are running out there on the old 4K basic ROMs with
580 simultaious display via a special program mod (They move the display
581 routines into RAM where the program can get at and use them.)
582 *** AN OLD ZX80 USER *** CISTOP MIKEY *** 5 JAN 83 **************
583 P.S. I don't have it any more, I gave it to my dad. It was a nice play
584 toy, but I really didn't have any use for it. I do have a TINY WUMPUS
585 game written for it that runs within the 1K of RAM. (It eats into the
586 display RAM a bit, but runs ok I will) If anyone is interested I will
587 put a copy of it here.
