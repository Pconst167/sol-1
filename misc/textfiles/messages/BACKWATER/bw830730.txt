41 I know that the phone co. used to sell something (I think it was
42 called a DAA?) that would allow connection of homebrew equipment
43 to the phone line. I heard that they no longer have them available
44 but that someone still sells them. Anyone out there have more
45 info. (come on BAD, I KNOW you work for Ma Bell! surely you have
46 SOME idea?)
47 I might be interested in such a device myself if I knew
48 where to get one.
49 I suspect that they will be expensive, because of all 
50 things they have to protect against. Shorting the line, feeding
51 wrong current/voltage to line, AF/IF/RF leakage to the line....
52 (any care to add some more?)
53 ps anyone have any HARD INFO about how the TTY for the

90 I FOUND THESE TO BE STABLE FROM ONE TEST TO ANOTHER (I AM NOT SAYING THAT THESE
91 COULD CHANGE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, HOWEVER, THEY DIDN'T CHANGE WHEN I TESTED
92 THEM). I WILL TAKE THE COMMENTS ON DRIVE 'B' SERIOUSLY THOUGH. I AM
93 DISAPPOINTED AT THE USERS OF BWMS FOR SHOOTING DOWN AN IDEA THAT THEY HAVE
94 APPARENTLY NOT TRIED THEMSELVES. I REPORT SUCCESS AND EVERYONE ELSE TELLS ME

105 to SYSM
106 Your measurements are very likely correct, but will depend very much on 
107 conditions you probably can't measure, like how much wire is between you
108 and your office. (Just out of curiousity, what office <prefix> are you
109 served by?) What was on the line when you were measuring( phone, impedance
110 of meter, etc)? When you measured the ringing voltage were you dealing with
111 an intra office call( from the same prefix), a local but inter office call,
112 or perhaps a long distance or operator call? Depending on office type, all
113 these may have a different ringing supply (also different will be test calls
114 by telco personnel). Did you measure the DC bias voltage, which is what the
115 actually trips the ring and puts you in talk mode.
116 When you measured the DC voltages, what conditions existed? Open circuit you
117 are measuring the supply used to detect "off hook", or your picking up the
118 handset. Talk supply is different, though it will usually be the same 50 volts,
119 it is filtered better. Toll or operator calls will have a different suplly,
120 as will intra vs. inter office calls (sometimes, it depends on your office.)
121 Not all offices are similar, for example some will reverse the voltage when
122 the person you called answers (it's used for detecting answer for billing
123 toll or metered calls.)
124 Please don't think I am trying to scare you off, if it works go for it, but
125 don't assume what works for you will work for anybody else, or even will
126 work tomorrow. The telephone is a very high technology item, and as such is
127 changing rapidly. You may be making calls over equipment over 50 years old,
128 or you may be among the first to use a new piece of gear on your next call.
129 Just remember who the law (not just the phone company) will hold responsible
130 if anything goes awry. Unfortunately, it is not easy to get correct data on
131 the phone system, as the new stuff is considered proprietary info, and who
132 needs obsolete data?
133 DAA's are not available, from anybody, as the law says that anything connected
134 to the phone system must be FCC registered, as a complete unit. An adapter
135 is not considered complete, and is not acceptable (except when used only by
136 itself). Ma Bell tried to continue to sell them, and was told naughty, naughty.
137 Things that plug into an Apple, and connect to the line run the ragged edge
138 of illegal.
139 
140 AS to mapping, it only applies when the same relationships apply to both the
141 first universe, and to the second, or when you are only interested in some
142 subset of relations that meet this critereon. It therefore cannot apply to,
143 say, human relations, because these are not matched by any other system.
144 In fact, all mappings can only be considered as aanalogies, and only with
145 a cetain amount of caution may they be used at all. Usually they are used
146 as a way to simplify something too complex to be handled whole; you map part
147 of it into something you can handle. Mathematical abstractions are not laws
148 of nature, but rather descriptions of same. All we know is an approximation
149 to reality, and if we describe it closely enough we can expect the real 
150 world to be about like our guess (call it theory, law, or abstraction, whatever)
151 Oh, mathematics and philosophy are so closely related that separating the two
152 is very hard, and often not possible at all, don't bother to argue the
153 difference, it just ain't there.
154 more on phones: no, Mike, the phone line isn't 600 ohms, it's more like
155 900 or 1200, depending on how you meaure it( frequency, etc), and is going
156 up because the newer smaller wires (cost, you know). Line sre tested with
157 the assumption they are 900, while toll circuits are rated at 600, many older
158 modems were rated at 450 ohms. However, it's not too critical.
159 Auto dialing is simply opening the phone line at 10 times a second enough
160 times for your number, wait 3/4 second between digits. Zero is ten opens.
161 Ideally, you should aim for having the open periods about 60% of the time,
162 or the closed circuit time about 2/3 of the open, but 50-50 works well.
163 Detecting dial tone isn't easy, so just wait a few seconds before your 
164 machine starts dialing.
165 A rather more difficult part of direct connect is the question of your out-
166 going signal drowning out the much weaker signal coming in; your telephone
167 contains what is called a hybrid coil so you can hear the other person, byt
168 your own voice doesn't blow your ear off. (It's a special tapped transformer)
169 for modems a resistor network is often enough.
170 Anything that doesn't use a carbon mike has got to be better.
171 ////////////////////////////////////////////BAD\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
172 BAD... I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS:
173 
174 1. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY MODEM (SET-UP AS ACOUSTIC OR DIRECT-CONNECT)
175 IT OCCASIONALLY ADDS A BIT OR TWO TO THE INCOMMING DATA. IT CAN'T BE OUTSIDE
176 DISTURBANCES (BECAUSE IT DOES IT WHILE HOOKED DIRECT CONNECT). IT ONLY HAPPENS
177 ABOUT EVERY 200 CHARS. AND WHEN I GET THE PROBLEM, IT PERSISTS FOR ABOUT 5
178 CHARACTERS OR SO (USUALLY NOT ALL GARBLED, BUT MOST IN THE SERIES). I THINK
179 IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE PHONE LINE, BUT I DON'T HERE ANY STATIC ON IT.
180 ANY SOLUTIONS????
181 
182 2. AS YOU REQUESTED, MY PREFIX IS 255. I KNOW THAT YOU CAN GET A RING-BACK
183 ON MY PREFIX BY DIALING 551 AND THE
184 LAST FOUR NUMBERS OF MY PHONE. THEN
185 CLICK THE LINE (HANG UP FOR ABOUT A SECOND), AND THEN HANG-UP. IN GRESHAM (GTE)
186 YOU CAN DIAL 999 AND A COMPUTER WILL TELL YOU THE PHONE NUMBER YOU ARE DIALING
187 FROM. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS ON THE BELL SYSTEM???
188 
189 ALSO, HOW WOULD YOU ELIMINATE RF INTERFERANCE ON THE LINE? MY DIRECT-CONNECT
190 CIRCUIT GENERATES A VERY FAINT BACKGROUND KWJJ. IT WAS A LOT WORSE, AND I GOT
191 RID OF MOST OF IT, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ELIMINATE ALL OF IT WITH SOME KIND OF
192 FILTER.
193 
194 AND...WHAT ARE MA BELL'S PLANS ON OPTOELECTRIC COMMUNICATIONS? (VIDEO? STEREO?)
195 
196 I ASKED A MA-BELL SERVICEMAN QUESTION TWO, AND HE WAS VERY EVASIVE...HE
197 ONLY ADMITTED THAT MA-BELL HAD A DEVICE FOR TELLING YOU YOUR OWN NUMBER AFTER
198 I TOLD HIM THAT GTE HAD SUCH A NUMBER.

300 FCC part 68.108 
301 Incidence of harm.
302  Should terminal equipment or protective circuitry cause harm to the
303 telephone network, the telephone company shall, where practicable notify the
304 customer that temporary discontinuance of service may be required; however,
305 where prior notice is not practicable, the telephone company may temporarily
306 discontinue service forthwith, if such action is reasonable in the
307 circumstances. In case of such temporary discontinuance, the telephone
308 company shall (a) promptly notify the customer of such temporary
309 discontinuance, (b) afford the customer the opportunity to correct the
310 situation which gave rise to the temporary discontinuance, and (c) inform
311 the customer of his right to bring a complaint to the commission pursuant to
312 the procedures set forth in Subpart E of this part.
313 
314 FCC part 68.110 (a)
315 Compatibility of the telephone network terminal equipment.
316 
317 (a) Availability of interface information.
318  Technical information concerning interface parameters not specified in this
319 part, including the number of ringers which may be connected to a particular
320 telephone line, which is needed to permit terminal equipment to operate in a
321 manner compatible with telephone company communications facilities, shall be
322 provided by the telephone company upon request.
323 
324 FCC part 68.215
325 Installation of other then "fully-protected" premises wiring.
326 
327 (g)(4) Requiring the use of protective apparatus.
328  In the event that any of the conditions listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this
329 section, (failure to pass acceptance testing) arises, and is not permanently
330 remedied within a reasonable time period, the telephone company may require
331 the use of protective apparatus which either protects soley against
332 hazardous voltages, or which protects both against hazardous voltages and
333 imbalances. Such apparatus may be furnished either by the telephone company
334 or by the customer. This right is in addition to the telephone company's
335 rights under 68.108
336 
337 FCC part 68.308 Deals with the signal power limitations of Registered
338 terminal equipment and REGISTERED PROTECTIVE CIRCUITRY.
339 
340 FCC part 68.310
341 Longitudinal balance limitations.
342 
343 (e) Registered Protective Circuitry for Loop Start Applications.
344 These criteria shall be met with either terminal of the interface to other
345 equipment connected to earth ground. The interface to other equipment shall
346 be terminated in an impedance which will be reflected to the telephone
347 connection as 600 ohms in the off-hook state of the registered protective
348 circuit, and the interface should not be terminated in the on-hook state.
349 
350 
351      What does this all mean?
352 
353 It means that DAA's (Registered Protective Circuitry) ARE legal for use on
354 telephone lines. It also means that the equipment MUST present an impedance
355 of 600 ohms to the telephone line.
356 
357 As to why Ma Bell doesn't supply DAAs any more, it is not because DAAs
358 in general were claimed illegal, but rather that that Ma was told by the FCC
359 that she could NOT require that they be installed unless there was proof
360 that the equipment that was intended to be attached to the line was
361 unregistered. Additionally, ALL new installations of equipment MUST be
362 registered. Since ma never registered her DAAs, they are not approved and
363 she can not install them on her own lines. DAAs do exist, they are being
364 sold by various manufactures, but they are not a moving item because there
365 is little need for them, most equipment being hooked up is registered
366 already, and there is no need for the DAA. If you want a DAA, you might try
367 C&L terminals in Portland, I think they might still have a
368 couple of Multitek DAAs laying around. Alterantly if you want to 'roll your
369 own', you can get a novation Phone Line Interface (PLI) module (from
370 Novation) which is the latest in DAAs. It uses a custom CMOS circuit to do a
371 lot of the work. Ceremtek is also selling a DAA if you prefer. American
372 MicroDevices (AMD) is currently working on a DAA on a chip in their lab which
373 should be out in a couple of years. If you are interested in the Novation
374 device, the number to call is (213)996-xxxx tell them you are interested in
375 the Phone Line Interface Module P/N 490278. It has a FCC registration number
376 of AU 492X-69442-DP-E and a ringer equivalence of 0.8B. The price for the
377 little bugger is $99.00 each. Sorry, I seem to have lost my info on the
378 Ceremtek DAA, so I don't know the number for you to call, But I think the
379 local rep for them is HowMar Enterprises. I'm not sure of this, but it
380 wouldn't hurt to give them a call to find out, besides they might know who
381 does rep Ceremtek if they don't. the number to call for them is
382 (206)659-xxxx. If I remember right, I think the price is about the same as
383 Novation's.
384 P.S. AMD is also working on a 212A on a chip the AM7912.
385 They also are working on a auto call comtrol chip the AM7925.
386 
387 You may wonder where I came by all of the above infomation, it is quite
388 simple really, I spent the last two years fighting with Ma Bell and the FCC
389 over the whole modem thing. As such I am VERY familur with the lastest
390 goings on. (My part 68 reg that I pulled the above from is two months old.
391 Which means it is probably obsolete by now, the regs in regard to the
392 telephone business as well as the equipment is changing dayly too.)

425 DO YOU CONSIDER POLITICS WORTH TALKING ABOUT? I DO. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
426 TO A HIGH SCHOOL ORGY BEFORE? YOU NEVER ANSWERED MY QUESTION ABOUT YOUR
427 SOFTWARE TURNING INTO HARDWARE. I AM NOT A STRANGE PERSON. JUST CURIOUS.

434 TO WHO IT MAY CONCERN,
435      I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE SUPERCEDING NUMBER OF THE QWACKING OF 
436 ----------
437 Sabra,
438   Indeed you are curious! No, I haven't been to a High School
439 Orgy before. I am just entering High School this year as a
440 freshman. By meaning software turning to hardware, do you mean
441 like I write a space invaders program, and it becomes the
442 machine? My fourth was good also. I first went over to the
443 Court Club with 2 of my best friends, went to see "RETURN OF
444 THE JEDI" for my second time. Then I lit off bottle rockets and
445 went to the local Corbett fireworks display.
446   I don't strike up political discussions very often, although
447 I have some strong opinions on subjects that I'd rather not
448 disclose on the Inn. Who told you about me and my software?

454    it is late......is anyone out there.....im begining to think
455  that there is one other backwater user out there,and he is
456 authoring all the messages,simulating all the personalities,conflicts,
457 thoughts as a big meta statement as to the real condition of the reality;
458 he knows im out here;but this is a reality in itself,it dosent need me
460 to exist,i am merely watching,being swept along...
461   i wonder how long i will watch.............is anything more real,
462 in the end?

506 NOTE: YOU CAN SET THE FORM SIZE WITH THE PX COMMAND, ALSO THE EXACT NUMBER
507 OF LINE FEEDS DONE IS DEPENDANT UPON WHEN THE LAST FORM FEED WAS DONE.
508 THE WHOLE THING IS MENT FOR PRINTERS SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE PRINTING
509 OUT HARD COPY IT WILL LINE UP ON FANFOLD PAPER PROPERLY. THE 6 IN THE 
510 PX COMMAND IS THE NUMBER OF LINES TO SKIP OVER THE PERFORATIONS.

523 Aaron, I once tried getting the DEAF-TTY info from Ma Bell. It
524 took the customer service person about an hour to find out that
525 I should call repair. It took the guy at repair a couple of days
526 to find out who I should call at Engineering. The guy at Engineering
527 gave me a number for a retired Bell employee who worked with the
528 people who modify the TTYs 
529 After all this I lost the number before I got around to
530 calling the person. If you want to try your luck... feel free.
531 I did get one "hard" piece of info. It seems that the
532 "modem" they use uses a tone for "MARK" & NO-TONE for "SPACE"!
533 (No wonder my modem went nuts!)
534 The way things are going, the ONLY reason why they are
535 not using 103 compatible (1-chip) modems is probably that it
536 would cost too much to convert the existing TTYs (if they could
537 FIND all of them!). It would be nice if someone came up with a chip
538 or even a multi-chip unit, that would recognize both protocols.
539 I'm sure that many people with the TTYs would use BBS systems
540 if their equip would allow it. (If I ever get some GOOD info
541 AND if I setup my own BBS, I'll try to have it accessible to 
542 DEAF TTY)

619 Deaf TTY terminals use BAUDOT code (a 5-bit serial code) at 45.5 Baud
620 (60 w.p.m.).  A start bit precedes a character, the character is sent with
621 the low bit first, and 2 stop bits follow (MARK).  Mark is sent for 1, 
622 space for 0.  If you have a TTY of this type, >DO NOT< try to connect it to 
623 your computer without modifications!!  The modem they use has a 60ma
624 current loop, which is probably larger than your equipment can take.
