20 Thought for the day while sitting around at the top:
21 
22 Some day, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides, and gravity,
23 we will harness for God the energies of love. And then, for the second
24 time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.
25                                                Pierre Teilhard de Chardin

28 The Bear tried to steady himself on the swaying bridge, and at the same time,
29 keep his sword high in front of him. He spread his legs and clutched the
30 mighty sword with both hands, pointed defensively at the three huge shapes
31 in front of him.
32 
33 The deep rumbling began to subside, and the shapes completed their upwards
34 ascent. Their pale white bodies cast off a strange glow, so that even in the
35 darkness the Bear could make out the shapes of their bodies.
36 
37 They were monstrous... nearly twenty feet high. They dripped with white slime,
38 their skin was smooth and pale and gleamed with its own glow.
39 
40 The Bear could barely make out their heads,which were dominated by huge, un-
41 blinking eyes. Thin black lines stretched below the eerie orbs where mouths
42 should have been.
43 
44 Bear stood his ground, sword raised, looking like a dwarf amidst a grove of
45 trees. "I come in peace!" he cried.
46 
47 The creatures stood in front of the bridge, staring at him. Silence reigned for
48 what seemed like hours. Finally, the middle one spoke. "Then why do you bring
49 sucha sword?"
50 
51 "There are many who would stop me on my quest. I must defend myself."
52 
53 Another long silence. "Aaah, but it is of no matter to us. For we could squash
54 you like a bug if we desired. As it is, we need only one thing from you."
55 
56 Another silence, Bear waited, legs poised for a quick dash over the other side
57 of the bridge. "And what is that?"
58 
59 "... Our toll of course. We are the toll-takers of Amelot. No one passes without
60 paying their due."
61 "And what is the toll?"
62 "What do you have?"
63 "Nothing, except my wits and my sword."
64 
65 There was another excruciatingly long silence. A deep growling seem to indicate
66 they were talking between themselves. Finally the middle one spoke again. "Then
67 you must bring us one thing."
68 A pause.
69 "...the egg of the dragon of Fendarr."
70 
71 "And where do I find such an egg?"
72 "... Go back fifty paces, and to your right you will find a small tunnel. Go
73 into there, and you will find the dragon. The rest is up to you."
74 
75 "And if I refuse?"
76 
77 "Then you will go back from whence you came.... or die...."

79 Hello -- I'm a new user; a friend gave me this number -- so far I'm confused!
80 I love the quote from Teilhard de Chardin -- right up my alley!  But the bear
81 story -- what's it for?   Lynne Lowe, 503-659-xxxx
82 I'm also a raw beginner -- I've had my Osborne Executive for several years,
83 but the Prometheus modem is new.  Using MDM730 as software, and so far I'm  
84 just barely (bearly??) managing to keep my nose above the quicksand....
85 Do you know where I can get hold of (or download???) the version of the
86 Adventure game (with the cave and the treasures and the pirate) which has
87 the magic mushroom and the sword in the stone?  I lust in my heart after a
88 copy of that game .... Can anyone help?  Thanks in advance!

90 How do I end this message?

92 Goodbye!

94    The general atmosphere in the confined space was one of hopelessness. At least it was breathable. Tariya had worked
95 up a spell that recirculated the air. Otherwise, they would have long ago suffocated. For about the hundredth time
96 James slammed his fist into the softly glowing wall. It was like hitting solid concrete. "I can't believe anybody can
97 screw up this badly."
98    "I'm sorry." Tariya said miserably.
99    James turned savagely. "And if you say 'sorry' one more time I'll... I'll..." He collapsed against the wall with a
100 curse. Since their prison was spherical, he slid down until he bumped into her at the bottom. "There has to be an out.
101 What's outside those walls?"
102    "We're at the focal point between two realities. The total weight of two universes are pressing against the walls.
103 There's no power in creation that can defy that kind of pressure."
104    "Something's defying that pressure or we wouldn't be here."
105    "It won't last."
106    "Swell." James thought for a moment. Then an idea hit him. "Of course! I could open a warpgate! I used to travel
107 using those things. All I have to do is open a hole to a habitable planet..."
108    "I thought of that already. I know how your travel gates work. If you open one here, all the energy will escape
109 through it and the bubble will immediately deflate. The pressure will smash us before we get a chance to
110 escape."
111    "Well, hell." James groaned, "We're gonna get smashed anyway, soon's the thing collapses."
112    "Yes, but..." Tariya swallowed hard. "I think I have another way. When I lost control of the spell, I needed more
113 power to regain it. I had to tap into my soul. It's forbidden but it was the only power source available."
114    "Yeah, that's how I get my power. So?"
115    "It was that power that protected us when the spell backlashed. It's also the power that holds this prison
116 together. If that power was suddenly cut off, the prison would vanish and you would find yourself back in the Crystal
117 Palace. As long as I live, this prison stands."
118    James suddenly had a sick feeling in his stomach. "What are you trying to tell me?" but he already knew.
119    She looked at him, her eyes holding an intensity he had never seen before. "When I accidently created this prison,
120 I doomed myself. I will never leave here alive. But you can still escape." She drew a deep breath and shuddered. "You
121 must kill me."

132 Yoikes I canta believe it. Justa when I thoughta things had cooled down a byte
133 these storys come rushing back into my computer. I can see one or I can see
134 even two but three entries on a single disk! Never would I have thoughta that
135 could happen, never in a million years I tell ya. Canchta cool it a bit and
136 keep the writing down to one entry per disk or maybe even one entry at the
137 top or one entry at the bottom. The stories are good but letus have a little
138 variety in what we read. Its the spice of life you know.

190 but of course, it is used for alot more than that... You can post stuff here like you do any other board, but we mostly like

192 Also, most of us make up our own borders, like my " ^"^"^" thing...
193 it's quite suggestable to start and end a message that way, so they know who's it is...

274  S.L.  -- I'll try from the Zeb viewpoint for a while...
275 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
276   There is something magic about sleep.  How simple (or, perhaps, 
277 not-so-simple) sleep can act as a restorative, a tranquilizer, a tonic
278 or simply an all-purpose refresher is a mystery.  Some traditions have it
279 that the "true" or "aetherial" self leaves the body during sleep, while
280 others hold that this "dream-time" is when the true reality of the world
281 becomes manifest.  How much more strange is this strange state of being,
282 then, when the sleeper originates in a totally different order of reality?
283 What strange thoughts, sequences, or dreams swim in a mind that has percieved
284 the world from the opposite direction?
285   Deep within the darkness of her mind, Zeb was dreaming, her mind weaving
286 the tapestry of remembered actions, forgotten motiviations, and yearnings
287 into a shifting dance of half-connected scenes.
288 ... A shimmering sunset on a warm beach, placing the ball of her foot 
289 delicately in the smooth indentation that pockmarked the sand, feeling the
290 kiss of the grains against the sensitive sole, the slow, sensuous transfer
291 of weight, the pristine smoothness of the unmarked sand as she slowly
292 withdrew the foot...
293 ...Atop a small ladder peering into a birds nest.  Three small forms,
294 slowly assembling fragments around them, building sperical citadels
295 in which to retreat from the world.  One egg was almost assembled, and
296 before her wondering eyes, the tiny pip closed, leaving a smooth unbroken
297 shell...
298 ... Wandering for timless eternities on an endless black plain,  unable,
299 even, to despair, cut off from life, cut off from love, cut off from
300 those to whom she was responsible...
301 ...The soft, milky smell of the tiny being she held to her breast.  The 
302 deep swell of love as the infant returned the nourishment, giving her
303 an uncomfortably full feeling before she could reabsorb the milk...
304   Suddenly tendrils of thought, the tentacles of another mind reached into
305 this occult brew of possibilities, groped, and made contact.  More and
306 more lines of thought fastened onto this ill-assorted group of images,
307 sending thoughts into them, pulling thoughts out.  Zeb's mind began to
308 retailiate, sending out its own tentacles to search out this strange
309 invader, followed them back to their source, searching for the cause of
310 this exchange.  Just as a complete electrical circuit is necessary for
311 a current to flow, so is its psychic equivalent.  Just as a negative
312 electrical charge is attracted to its positive counterpart, so is its
313 psychic equivalent.  When Zeb's mind completed the psychic circuit with
314 the lady Tayree, the two began to flow together.

321 The Bear backed off the bridge slowly, sword still at the ready. The dimly lit
322 figures still wavered next to the bridge, their huge eyes gazing at him intent-
323 ly.. but as usual, silently. When his feet once again hit the firm ground, he
324 continued to back away, but now he counted his steps. The eerie creatures
325 vanished as quickly as they had come, swallowed up in the inky black of the 
326 cave.
327 
328 The Bear turned and counted off the rest of his steps. ...49, 50. He turned to
329 his right, and slowly made his way toward a dark shape looming ahead of him.
330 Its blackness stretched above and beyond him, and he knew it was the wall of
331 the cave. But there was a deeper black, and from it a wafting of warm air
332 eased out. His nostrils flared with the sickening smell. But he knew he must
333 continue on, for his Ladyship had endowed him with this Quest above all others,
334 and he knew he must not fail.
335 
336 His glowing sword seemed swallowed up by the deepening blackness as he entered
337 the smaller cave. But in the narrower surroundings, he could now see the walls
338 and the ground beneath him. He kept
339 on, slightly crouched. He noticed the cave was getting smaller, he now had to
340 walk with his chest almost touching his knees. It grew smaller, he was now on
341 all fours. Still it narrowed, and the overpowering smell of sulphur grew even
342 stronger.
343 
344 Finally, he was crawling. His sword clutched before him, he slithered along
345 the rough ground as far as he could. There! Suddenly, a light ahead! He urged
346 himself forward, almost trapped by the
347 shrinking walls.
348 
349 And immediately he was upon it. The end of the tunnel. His heart leaped into
350 his throat, his sword held immobile by his trapped extended arms. For not ten
351 feet away, at the end of the small
352 tunnel, was a light as deep and evil as one would see if he stared face to 
353 face with the devil. For it was an eye, nearly as large as the Bear's head.
354 
355 And at the end of the cave, it peered at him with delight, as if this small
356 creature before it was soon to be its prey....

419     Somewhere beyond the comprehensible dimensions, the black plain still existed. No
420 living being now trod upon its surface. It was not long before the lack of activity
421 was noticed.
422     In the center of the plain the mists began to swirl. They coagulated into a dense
423 thunderhead, complete with lightning bolts. In the formation, something moved.
424     A single metallic boot, the color of the plain and the size of a small house,
425 decended upon the surface. It landed with the weight of a thousand planets and the
426 whole of the trillion kilometer plain shook. Another boot slammed down beside it. The
427 thunderhead lifted to reveal a titan.
428     It was humanoid, Over ten stories tall, and was encased in black armor forged of
429 adamantium steel. Circuitry, fittings, and instruments of all types all but covered
430 its surface. A pack large enough to house a family of eight rested on its back with
431 numerous antennas protruding from the top. Two red eyes burned laser-bright behind a
432 meter thick obsidian visor. Those eyes scanned the entire surface of the plain with
433 the thoroughness of a starship sensor bank.
434     The creature that had been placed here for observation was gone.
435     How could this be? The titan elected to find out. Massive arms spread wide and a
436 pentagram formed of lines of brilliant green fire and twenty meters across formed
437 directly in front of the titan. The air inside the pentagram swirled and grew milky.
438 Then it cleared.
439     He saw the subject on the plain, just as he had left it. He saw another figure
440 appear near it. The subject attempted to terminate its existance with the help of the
441 intruder, but failed. A ship of multidimensional proportions appeared. A number of
442 beings came out, and after some apparent confusion, carried the subject and the
443 intruder into the ship. After some delay, the ship was forcibly evicted from the
444 plain by the same force that had shifted the plain out of the multiverse.
445     The pentagram collapsed, its usefuless ended. The titan was faced with a
446 decision. Should he reclaim the subject, or simply start over. He was already faced
447 with the nuisance of restoring the plain to its former location.
448     The subject must be retreived. The pentagram had provided the means to find the
449 intruders. There were many quastions here that needed to be answered. And perhaps
450 punishments to be dealt out. A great experiment had been disrupted.
451     The thunderhead billowed about the titan's form and suddenly the plain was
452 abandoned once again.

462   L'Homme -- The 4110 series "Select-Code" sequence is
463 <Esc>%!{int 0/1} (I beleive it's the same for the 4107)  The actual chars
464 you send, then are:
465 for Select-Code TEK -- <Esc>%!0
466 for Select-Code ANSI -- <Esc>%!1
467 My 4112, however, does not seem to respond to that sequence in setup mode --
468 try shipping it to your 4107 and see if it works.

479 I am saddened to my very bone,
480 For my love died and left me alone.
481 She killed herself while I was away,
482 When I returned, I could only pray.
483 I cried and mourned, wandered and wept.
484 I went not to bed, I could not have slept.
485 I have prayed to every god conceived,
486 I pray no more, my love not retrieved.
487 
488 Many a day and sleepless night,
489 I have spent pondering my mournful plight.
490 No one understands, they never do,
491 What I am enduring and going through.
492 If I had only one wish in my entire life,
493 I'd ask for one thing to end my strife.
494 That one favor to ask, that one wish,
495 Is that someone would buy me another fish.
496 My poor little fish, she died and lost her soul,
497 After she went and jumped out of her bowl.

527 The Doctor, luckily, was still staying at the Inn.
528 "Why hello!  It's you again.  Miss us already?  I'm touched," he said.
529 Milchar spoke to him.  "I KNOW you're touched.  In the head."
530 I broke in.  "May I sit down?"  They nodded, and I sat.  "I really didn't
531 plan on being back quite so soon, but now that I am, I'd like to ask some
532 questions.  Stop me if I seem too nosey.  One: where did that stabilizer
533 circuit come from?"
534 "Let me see it."  I handed the board to him.  "Hmmmm... this isn't the one I
535 intended to give you.  It's the spare for the new extraplanar drive K-9 has
536 installed.  I recieved two boards like this from Gallifrey."
537 "And where did THEY get it?" I asked.
538 "I really don't know.  If it's important, I could ask.  Just a moment."
539 The Doctor pulled out an odd-looking device from one of his seemingly
540 bottomless pockets, and fiddled with it for a bit.
541 "K-9 says it's an import, from an adjoining plane, about nine days into its
542 future.  Some clever fellow there rigged it up, and gave it to us as a token
543 of goodwill, I suppose.  Does it really matter, if you can make one yourself?
544 "Aha, but you have hit upon the problem, Doctor.  I cannot make one.  I am not
545 entirely certain how it works.  I do have some field data when it was
546 operating, however."
547 The Doctor looked shocked, and mumbled something about "upsetting cultures
548 with premature introduction of technology" to Milchar, who nodded and looked
549 grave.
550 The Doctor reluctantly handed the board back.  "You bought this, it's yours.
551 I will not help you further, though.  Your culture must discover the principles
552 upon which this is made on its own, without my help."
553 My heart sank.  The only person who could give me untold knowledge about this
554 whole mess had just refused!
555 Milchar seemed to sense my despair.  "That doesn't mean you can't enjoy our
556 hospitality in other ways."  He called to the innkeeper, who provided the trio
557 of us each with a meal (no syntho!), and a drink which I hoped had some real
558 ethanol in it.  I sipped it.  It did.
559 We ate and drank at our table for some time thereafter.  At the end of the
560 evening I was in much better spirits, since much better spirits had gotten
561 into me.  I did not remember going to sleep, but somehow sleep came.

585     From Prometheus; Etched
586     I innocently ventured home after school recently, and found a parcel in
587 waiting.  The parcel had a return address with no name, and was addressed to
588 me.  Inside the thing, I found a circa 1937 etching of Prometheus Bound.
589 
590     I don't happen to know anyone in La Grande, and never have. There was no
591 letter or anything inside the parcel excepting the etching's front page.
592 About the only thing I happen to have is the address on the parcel.
593 
594     The postal service works in mysterious ways.
