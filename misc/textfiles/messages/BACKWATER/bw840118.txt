21      I AM STARTLED, TO SAY THE LEAST.  "AND YOU ARE BARNEY GAN CEANACH?" I ASK.
22      "Barney's good enough.  Look, toots, we need to have a long talk, and
23 it 'ud be better if we did it away from prying eyes," HE MUTTERED.  "we'll
24 head back to your place."
25      "PRYING EYES!  SOMEONE IS HERE?"  I FLUSH, REMEMBERING MY STATE.  THE
26 SPELLS CAST BY A WITCH USUALLY REQUIRE A STATE AS CLOSE TO NATURE AS POSS-
27 IBLE, BUT THAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN WATCHED...  WHO WOULD BE SO... CRUDE?  I
28 QUICKLY GATHER MY CLOAK AROUND MYSELF.
29      "Oh, don't worry.  He got an eyeful, but you ain't got nothin' to look
30 at anyway."  HIS ENTIRE DEMEANOUR IS INSULTING, AND I GROW ANGRY AT HIS RE-
31 MARKS.
32      "NOW, WAIT A MINUTE!  I'M NOT THAT..."
33      "You're way too short, and skinny too.  Maybe if you put a little meat
34 on those bones," HE PAUSES, AND LAUGHS.  "Not that it matters.  He has a
35 camera, too.  He'll be surprised when he gets home.  Hope he likes jello."
36 HE STOPS SUDDENLY, AND THEN HE JUMPS INTO THE AIR AND SCREAMS.  I AM QUITE
37 STARTLED, BUT TRY TO MAINTAIN AN AIR OF DIGNITY, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT
38 CONSIDERING MY POSITION.  HE THEN SCREAMS "Tha te ur am buth an tailleir!"
39 AND I FIND......THAT I AM IN MY HOME, AND SITTING ON MY OWN COUCH.  TEA IS
40 LAID OUT ON THE TABLE BEFORE ME, MY BEST DELFT CHINA, WITH A SERVING FOR 2.
41      THIS IS MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HIM CLOSELY.  HE IS SHORT, EVEN
42 SHORTER THAN ME, AND HE IS FAR FROM WHAT I HAD THOUGHT A MEMBER OF THE GREAT
43 ELLYLLON WOULD APPEAR.  HIS HAIR IS A RATHER DULL BROWN, HIS EYES THE SAME,
44 AND THE ONLY THING THAT LOOKS THE LEAST BIT ELVIN IS HIS EARS, WHICH ARE
45 DISTINCTLY POINTED, AND HIS COMPLEXION WHICH IS UNUSUALLY UNMARKED.  IT IS
46 STRANGE FOR ME TO SIT HERE, WAITING TO CONVERSE WITH THIS BEING.
47      "Now I wants you should just sit there and listen to whats I gunna say
48 to ya," he says, doing an excellent Cagney.
49      "YOUR GRAMMER IS ATROCIOUS."  I COMMENT, HOPING PERHAPS TO THROW HIM
50 OFF STRIDE.
51      "Yup, ma'am, I'ma doin' it cuz I know ya don't likes it," he drawls, as
52 he switches to John Wayne.  "I'ma
53 goin' ta try ta break ya, ya see."  JUMPING INTO A CHAIR (I NOTICE THAT THE
54 CUSHION OF THE CHAIR DOESN'T SAG, AS IF THERE IS NO WEIGHT) HE CONTINUES.
55 "Actually, I came here because I think you're not too bad, for a mortal-type
56 individual, and I owe your Granny a favour."
57      "WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME?" I ASK.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND MUCH OF THIS, AND
58 HIS PERSONALITY HAS GIVEN ME PAUSE.
59      "In the first place," HE RESPONDS, "You've had a bad time of it lately
60 and you've let it get to you.  You've got to remember that, no matter how
61 bad it seems to you, it's worse for someone else.  So you lost the love-of-
62 your-life, he was just a jerk anyway."
63      "HE WAS A KIND AND GENTLE SOUL, LOVING AND GIVING!"  I AM GROWING VERY
64 ANGRY WITH THIS CREATURE.  "IT WAS THROUGH MY OWN INACTION THAT I LOST HIM,
65 NOT THROUGH ANYTHING HE DID."
66      "He was a jerk," he yells, "jerk, jerk, jerk!  Just look at what led to
67 your separation, look at it from an unbiased point of view for once.  He was
68 just as much to blame as you were, so quit being a martyr!"  HE JUMPS FROM
69 THE CHAIR AND BEGINS TO PACE.  "And another thing.  You're always so worried
70 about what other people think, and always crawling into a shell.  You've got
71 to be more outgoing.  A friend of your's at the Inn was going to give you a
72 gift, and you probably alienated him by avoiding him!"  I BLANCH, THINKING
73 OF GOOD DJJ.  "You're oh-so-logical when dealing with an issue that has no
74 emotional involvement for you, but if you're involved, all that goes out the
75 window."
76      HE STOPS IN FRONT OF ME, AND POINTS HIS FINGER.  "And there you are,
77 boring all those nice Inngoers with your silly self-serving stories!  Who do
78 you think you are anyway?  The natives are restless, and most are incredibly
79 bored with all this crap.  You've got a lot going for you, and I think that
80 it's time you realized it!"
81      I AM DEEPLY HURT BY WHAT HE HAS SAID, BUT I SEE THAT THERE IS A GREAT
82 DEAL OF TRUTH IN IT.  I HAVE HEARD THE MURMURS, AND I KNOW MY OWN ATTITUDE
83 COULD USE A CHANGE.  THE HURT MUST SHOW ON MY FACE, BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST
84 TIME, BARNEY'S OWN FACE REFLECTS A SENSE OF COMPASSION.  "Look, what I've
85 got to say to you is probably none of anyone else's business, so why don't
86 you shut the windows?"
87      I RISE FROM THE COUCH, BAR THE DOOR, AND CLOSE THE SHUTTERS ON THE WIN-
88 DOWS, PERHAPS FOR THE LAST TIME.

92 Growing tired of waiting the piper slung his pipes to his shoulder and winded
93 them.  He piped up a sprightly air and started down the path.  In a short time,
94 he reached a small bridge over the stream.
95   What secrets do you hold?" he murmured softly.  "what have you seen to never
96 tell?"  
97 Smiling softly he turned onto the path that lead through the gathering twilight.
98 A few steps and a distant lantern began to contest the gathering night.  
99 
100 "Perhaps a tune might buy my a drop to drink" he mused.  He set the pipes on his
101 shoulder, winded them and began a jolly happy tune.  As he approached the door 
102 of the inn, the door opened before him and he piped himself into the large room
103 just beginning to fill with the eveningscustomers.  Bringing his tune to a close
104 he swung down his pipes and called to the innkeeper "Good sir!  Long have I 
105 traveled, and I find myself hungry tired
106 and thirsty.  Would you barter some amusement for your customers for a night's
107 rest and a meal?"

109 I couldn't help myself.  This wasn't the first time.  Marsupial vision
110 showed me the familiar eclectic heap.  I dug in, famished.  What tidbits
111 I found had already been partially digested by time.  I ate my fill.  I was
112 safe here.
113 	Having finished my feast I headed for home.  The grass was damp with the dew
114 of early morn.  Coming out of the grass, I could feel the hard, smooth
115 surface under my feet.  This place always made me long for home.  A brightness
116 to my right caught my attention.  I must continue but cannot turn my back on
117 the strange light which even now grows brighter, brighter, and now the
118 noise of it.  Tremendous and awful then I know I have been killed.
119 
120 	Damn!  The same dream again.  I pour a cup of hot-black from the timer model
121 Mr. Coffee.  Get my mind off it.  Play with the computer.  I find the
122 strangest BBS.  I read a few articles and decide to enter one myself:
123 "I couldn't help myself.  This wasn't the first time..."

135      Hate is like acid. It can damage the vessel in which it is stored as 
136 well as destroy the object on which it is poured.
137      A certain amount of opposition is a help, not a hindrance. Kites rise 
138 against the wind, not with it.
139      When a friend is in trouble, don't annoy them by asking if there is 
140 anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it.

143 A national park ranger cautions visitors against feeding 
144 the animals.  He explains that the deer grow accustomed 
145 to visitors' handouts and lose the ability to fend for 
146 themselves.  Bears, he observes, come to believe that 
147 free food is their due - becoming grouchy and violent if 
148 they don't get it.  Chipmunks and squirrels congregate 
149 where handouts are plentiful.  Thus the balance of 
150 nature is completely upset.   Is there a lessen here for 
151 people and their governments?

154      In  the  distance  a lone figure wanders  through  the  tree 
155 scattered landscape.  Cloak tightly wrapped about him to keep out 
156 the cold.  Slowly his wanderings bring him towards the crossroads 
157 upon which the Inn is located.   One road leads to the dank  dark 
158 forests  while the other leads to the blinding steel and stone of 
159 the  cities.   Out of the forest moves the lonely figure  towards 
160 the haven of the Inn to wrap himself in the warmth of freindship.  
161 Crossing the small bridge that traverses the small stream he pays 
162 no mind to the slowly moving waters beneath, for tonight the warm 
163 waters  offer  no sollus for the werry.   He moves  to  keep  the 
164 appointment  that  was  made,  and worries that it not  be  kept.  
165 Opening  the well oiled doors of the Inn he steps in slightly  in 
166 fear for his past actions have left a tarnished image at the Inn.  
167 Looking  about for a moment,  he spies a doorway leading  to  the 
168 back of the Inn.   Parting the old and ragged curtain he spies an 
169 old rickity table and chairs to match.   Obviously discarded here 
170 in  favour  of the more usable sort without.   Closer  inspection 
171 shows  that someone has been here recently for the  cobwebs  have 
172 been  half  heartedly  removed  and  the  dust  disturbed  as  if 
173 searching  for  something.   Taking no mind he slowly goes  about 
174 cleaning the ages of dust and grime and shoring up the table  and 
175 chairs  as best possible.  The work complete,  he gently  settles 
176 back in the flimsy chair and opens a large bottle of ale to await 
177 the  coming appointment.   Many thoughts drift through  his  head 
178 such  that  even he can not follow them all and where they  might 
179 lead.   Past memories and present mix in a kelidescope of jumbled 
180 thought.   Finaly the combination of the hard days work, the ale, 
181 and  the clouded thoughts cause him to nod off  to  sleep,  while 
182 hoping that the friend will not forget him.

188 The Mercedes is smooth. The rain is altogether outside the spere
189 of its clean, soft cocoon, and the music is cool and groovin in the
190 night.  He is intensely aware, the hour of the night his peak,
191 the tenor of the sax his anthem. The gleaming smile of neon is all around 
192 him and the shine on the raindrenched street simply emphasizes and
193 sharpens the images of the city and this life. Nothing in America
194 could compare to this life on the outside, this freedom, this badness,
195 this thrill of the night. Nothing can cut down the Prince in his
196 royal Highness. The brightness of the dark is sung in the soulcry song
197 of the horns. No one knows the truth.

202 	Realizing that Pam and that she had summoned were gone, he moved in closer. In
203 spite of the stranger's presence he had not dared approach the clearing. He had 
204 seen what Pam was carrying and knew from his studies what the requirements
205 of the ritual might be. He would not shame his friend by observing, nor would he
206 risk interrupting the ceremony.
207 	He thought back to that afternoon when he had cast the coins. They had
208 indicated that there was danger, but that through correct action, much of it 
209 would be removed. After consulting other augurs, he had determined that he must 
210 be near the clearing that night. Unfortunately, he had not seen the stranger in 
211 time and had had to settle for watching him from a distance and hoping that he
212 could stop him in time.
213 	Now he could tell that Pam and that which she had summoned were gone. He
214 approached the stranger, a city man by his dress. 
215 	He suddenly broke into a run. He had heard of devices like that which the man
216 held. He must destroy that image machine!
217 	"And what, pray tell art THOU doing here Sirrah? Mayhap thou hast been
218 observing that which was not meant for the likes of you?"
219 	The man dropped the device as the hooded and cloaked shape appeared out of the 
220 darkness. The figure's staff swung out and the man collapsed from the blow. 
221 	He stooped over the man and checked him over. He was alright, barring a lump
222 over one ear. He then went to the device and opened it, intending to destroy the
223 image. He stared at what he found and then sat down laughing.
224 	Jello! It was full of Jello! When his laughter had died to an occasional
225 chuckle he reclosed the device and put it in the man's pouch. Standing once more
226 he seemed smaller than when he had confronted the stranger. He took hold of the 
227 man and proceeded to drag him to the road.
228 	Upon reaching it he paused and threw back his head. Any witnesses would have
229 been startled by the cry that issued from his throat. Shortly, there was an 
230 answering cry from nearby. He smiled.
231 	A wolf trotted from the underbrush and walked to face him. "Greetings, 
232 Gray One.", he said as he extended a hand toward the wolf. "I am sorry to bother
233 you but I have need of thy aid." After a few more minutes of conversation the
234 wolf departed. Time passed....
235 	He seemed to be listening, though to what, none could have said. At last the
236 sound of hoofbeats was audible. A man dressed in brown and gray appeared riding 
237 a roan mare. He raised a hand in salute.
238 	"I got your 'note', Erik. What's up?
239 	The one called Erik swiftly explained what had transpired. As he did so the
240 other's expression became grim.
241 	"What this fool has done deserves..."
242 	"Hold! My apoligies, Lord, but I must remind you that you do NOT rule here!" 
243 His voice softening he continued, "Lord Sam, I am well aware of your feelings in
244 regard to such matters. I fear that in this land your methods would be thought a
245 bit extreme. I think it may suffice to merely make an example of this fool."
246 	"Perhaps. Your master thinks well of your judgement. What do you have in mind?"
247 	"I believe that on your way here for your visit with my master, you passed
248 through the city?"
249 	"Yes, but.."
250 	"Please my lord, all will be made clear.  Did you notice the pillory?"
251 	A smile crossed the rider's face, "Are you suggesting...
252 	"But of course, why should not the punishment fit the crime?"
253 	"Very well, if you will write the charge notice..."
254 	"I have it here, lord. I wrote it while waiting for you." He bowed and handed
255 a roll of parchment up to the rider, who tucked it inside his tunic.
256 	"Now for the that fool, if you please." Sam bent low, to help Erik with the 
257 bound figure. After it had been placed upon the horse, Sam remounted.	
258 	"Farewell, my young friend!"
259 	Erik returned the farewell. After the rider had vanished into the darkness Erik
260 started for home. He almost wished he could be in the city square in the morning
261 to see the stranger awaken in the pillory, naked with a notice proclaiming him a
262 'pPeeping Tom'.
263 	He doubted that there would be any trouble, the stranger's memories of his and 
264 Pam's faces would have been blurred by his master while treating the head blow 
265 and even though these were not Sam's lands, he WAS a noble and his signature on 
266 the proclamation would be sufficient. Perhaps after a few days in the
267 square the stranger would have learned some manners.

269 BARD:	yes, dost thou know the lady Mirandel? I first heard the tale of ranger
270 Arvid from her at a dance class at the Towers.
271 ..................by my hand at the hour of Prime, this 15th day of January.....
272 ...........................the apprentice.......................................
273 AH, well isn't it a small world! I certainly do know Mirandel. I was there too! 
274 I think I know who you are "Erik". I was one of the other singers that night

277 	Lord of the Dance
278 	
279 When she danced on the water and the wind was her horn
280 The Lady laughed and everything was born
281 When she lit the sun and the light gave him birth
282 The Lord of the Dance first appeared on the earth.
283 (chorus) Dance, dance wherever you may be
284 	I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
285 	And I'll live in you if you'll live in me
286 	And I'll lead you all in the dance, said he.
287 
288 I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
289 I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,
290 I was called from the darkness by the song of the earth,
291 I joined in the singing and she gave me birth.
292 	chorus
293 I sleep in the kernel and I dance in the rain
294 I dance in the wind and through the waving grain
295 When you cut me down, I care nothing for the pain
296 In the Spring I'm the Lord of the Dance once again.
297 	chorus
298 I dance in the circle when the flames leap up high
299 I dance in the fire and I never, ever die
300 I dance on the waves across the bright summer seas
301 I am the Lord of the waves mysteries.
302 	chorus
303 I dance at the Sabbat when you dance out the spell
304 I dance and sing that everyone be well
305 When the dancing's over, do not think I am gone
306 To live is to dance, so I dance on and on.
307 	chorus
308 The moon in her phases, and the tides of the sea
309 The movement of the earth and the seasons that will be
310 Are the rhythm of the dancing and a promise through the years
311 That the dance goes on through our joys and our fears.
312 	chorus
313 The Horn of the Lady cast its sound 'cross the plains
314 The birds took the notes and gave them back again
315 'Til the sound of Her music was a song in the sky
316 And to that song there is one reply
317 	chorus
318 They danced in the darkness and they danced in the night
319 They danced on the earth and everything was light
320 They danced out the darkness and they danced in the dawn
321 And the day of their dancing still goes on.
322 	chorus
323 I see the maidens laughing, as they dance in the sun
324 And I count the fruits of harvest one by one
325 I know the storm is coming but the grain's all stored
326 So I dance the Dance of the Lady and Her Lord.
327 	chorus
328 We dance ever slower, as the leaves fall and spin
329 And the sound of the horn is the wailing of the wind
330 The earth is wrapped in stillness and we move in a trance
331 But we hold on fast to our faith in the Dance.
332 	chorus
333 The sun is in the southland and the days grow chill
334 The sound of the horn is fading on the hill
335 The horn of the Hunter, as he rides 'cross the plain
336 And the Lady sleeps, 'Til the Spring comes again.
337 	chorus
338 The sun is in the southland and the days lengthen fast
339 And soon we will sing for the Winter that is past
340 Now we light the candles and rejoice as they burn
341 And we dance the Dance of the sun's return.
342 	chorus
343 I gaze on the heaven and I gaze on the earth
344 I feel the pain of dying and rebirth
345 I lift my head in gladness and praise for the day
346 Of the Dance of the Lord and the Lady gay.

350    Bobby's car sighed into the drive as the automatic door opened rumbling
351 in the cavernous parking garage. Pulling into his assigned space he cut the
352 ignition and sat a moment. It`s wearing down, he thought. He slid from
353 the car seat and stepped out into the dimly lit garage, locking up care-
354 fully after years of experience with thieves in the city.
355   The apartment was cold and he checked the thermostsat to make sure it was
356 up. It was getting to be impossible to deal with that punk of a super
357 if and when you could drag him away from his sissy friends. 
358   He lit a cigarette and took a mighty slosh from the ever present
359 bottle of Stolichnaya on the endtable. Trembling from his recent 
360 brush with death he sank into a chair to await the call from
361 Bambino. He was certain he had him this time. No way could he have
362 detcted Bobby's hand in all this. Bobby chuckled and tipped the
363 vodka again, spilling cool drops down his shirtfront and feeling the
364 high recede.

369 Watched "Focus On Society" on OEPBS this a.m.  The show suggested that 75%
370 of the U.S. population believes in God.  It further suggested that 25% 
371 believe in astrology.  I was stunned!  It showed me that I have had my head
372 in the sand for the past 15 years in thinking that the general population
373 had somehow been enlightened during those years I went to so much trouble
374 sorting out the bs from my observations.  Apparently, there was an en masse
375 departure from organized religion by my generation (I knew that, didn't
376 know if organized religion knew) but now that we are in our thirties, many
377 are returning to the safe, cozy blanket of blind faith.  Am I missing
378 something?  This is incredible to me because the stark reality that I
379 -really- don't believe in concerned, intelligent beings/forces that alter
380 or monitor my every thought and move is so apparent now.
381 
382 Observations:
383 Actions cause reactions; space-time exists.
384 Mental processes interact with space-time.
385 No one knows why.
386 
387 The last observation is the one that causes so much trouble.  Is there
388 really no purpose (in terms of accomplishment) to our existence.  How
389 insulting to think that there is no purpose to life; that the universe just

409      A  stray  beam  of light pokes through the  dirty  forgotten 
410 window shinning upon the recently swept floor.  Slowly it travels 
411 towards  the table as the morning sun rises without.  Shortly  it 
412 touches a leg of the table and quickly travels to the table  top.   
413 Soon it touches, then surrounds the man sitting at the table fast 
414 asleep  with  his head in his arms.   The light shines  upon  his 
415 tangle of brown hair and seems to make it glow.  After a while in 
416 the soothing warmth of the light the man stirs, then rises with a 
417 jerk, "Where am I?"
418      After  a confused moment he remembers,  he is still in  that 
419 abandoned room behind the Inn.  Through the ragged curtain he can 
420 hear the Innkeeper and his help going about preparing for the new 
421 days business.  Looking down at the table he remembers his reason 
422 for  being here the night before,  yet it all seems a dream  with 
423 little  support from reality.   Only the empty bottle of ale  and 
424 the two glasses indicate that anything at all had occured.
425      Sitting back down at the table,  he bellows to the Innkeeper 
426 to  bring him breakfast.   The Innkeeper pokes his startled  face 
427 through  the  curtain and exclaims "Are you  still  here?",  then 
428 quickly disappears.  
429      Thinking back on the nights activities, it all seemed like a 
430 dream.   Indeed the appointment had been kept,  yet he remembered 
431 little  of it.   He remembered begining to tell of his tale  past 
432 with but an occasional prompting, but sometime during the telling 
433 he had grown tired and now he found himself alone again.  If only 
434 he could remember what had happened, something about a promise to 
435 return  for a greater telling,  and what was the device that  had 
436 been placed on the table?  Something called a recorder?  Too much 
437 wine  and  too little sleep has caused his mind to  not  remember 
438 these  things of importance.   Ahh,  if there were only a way  to 
439 quickly do the telling before he forgot once again.   If only  he 
440 could  remember!   And  who  was this good friend  who  took  the 
441 treasure of his past and was gone?  And yet he seemed to remember 
442 that  like  tales  had been given in return.   If only  he  could 
443 remember who...
444      Just  then  the Innkeeper came in bringing him a piping  hot 
445 breakfast which he settled down to eat.   While he was eating  he 
446 overheard  the  Innkeeper  and the barmaid discusing  in  worried 
447 tones the disappearance of one they called "d".   A familar name, 
448 yet one he had only heard in passing.  Thinking back he did think 
449 that  he had seen a fleeting glance of this lass upon  his  first 
450 vist  to the Inn,  and he wonders too at the disappearance of one 
451 who seems to hold such respect and concern at the Inn.

455 Yes, it seems that there are quite a few misguided souls out there thAat need
456 that crutch called GOD!! Why do you think they are refered to as Flocks! Don't
457 take any responsibility for your existance as long as someone else will lead
458 and you can follow. The Moral Majority is just a sheepherd trying to lead all
459 away from the wolves. Personally the wolves are just as necessary on this earth
460 as the sheepherds and really a lot more productive.

464     With the sight of the ship climbing twords the heavens came the stark 
465 realization that this planet of half-civilized savages was to be his new home
466 for the duration of the sentance. Already he could feel the nerve-net that 
467 drew together his society slipping from his grasp. He was, for the first time
468 in his life, totally alone. As the boundaries of his mind turned slowly
469 inward he began to see beasts that had long ago been banished by a species
470 wide linkage of minds. He knew that within a matter of days he too would 
471 revert to the repulsive level of life on this planet. On the horizon was
472 a glow that could only mean a large city. In the light of a billion stars 
473 he could barely discern a sign. If he could read he would have saw WELCOME
474 TO PORTLAND  pop. 300,000. With a barely audiable sigh he began to shuffle
475 in the direction of the lights.

479 	The night winds blows right through my hair
480 	a shivery feeling is something to bear
481 	I see the moon with its beauty,
482 	but soon the clouds hide it from me.
483 	how cold am I with the fog far behind,
484 	how scared am I, I can almost cry,
485 	but morning follows and life seems new
486 	how grateful can I be for the things I 
487 	have seen.
488 

Daver, please notify me of the results of your investigation on the
489 high-tech green carpet. I have been experiencing a continual loss 
490 of personal objects such as: socks, contact lenses, pet fish, homework,
491 retainer, sisters and brothers (brothers less missed than others).

495      The long evening with my good friend Tarn was  very  productive  and
496 restful to my soul as well.  It was a great joy, speaking of  times  past
497 and viewing the changes and  evolutions  that  have  occurred.   And  the
498 people of those times!  Some of them were dingy to be sure,  but  usually
499 with a glint in their eyes of good humor.
500      Toward the end of the night, after some  great  time,  Tarn  made  a
501 comment to me in jest that I took otherwise.  It was the  wearyness  that
502 caused  my mind to be slow, and much to my later dismay I  realized  that
503 my response might have  caused  Tarn  to  be  hurt.   Though  we  quickly
504 laughed over the mistake,  I have felt some  shame  since  over  it.   Ah
505 well, good Tarn is a true friend, and he understands how  foolish  I  can
506 be at such late times.
507      Walking  swiftly  along  the  footpath,  the  sound  of  the  stones
508 beneath my feet is a welcome percussion to the symphony of  emotion  that
509 the favor my friend has done for me brings  to  my  heart.   Such  times!
510 Such friends!  And such  a  good  Inn,  whose  Keeper  can  put  up  with
511 children such as Tarn and I.

515 QUERY:  Is is true that Stan Dolson's real name is Mr. Obnoxious?
516 ................................................................................
517 	In the silence, following the piper's tune, the bard spoke up. "You're pretty 
518 good with those pipes, friend. What say we alternate for a while? It'll save my 
519 voice and your lungs!"
520 	Then to the crowd, "Any requests, Ladies & Gents?"
521 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
522 YEAH! SHUT THAT BLOODY ROWL!
523 
524 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
525 JUST FOR THE RECORD, CYM AND AWESOME, MAY I REPEAT A FORGOTTEN TRUISM.
526 MAN HAS AN INNATE DESIRE FOR A GOD, WHETHER IT BE SCIENCE, RELIGION, 
527 MONEY, THEMSELVES, HIGHER LEARNING, AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.
528 EVERY CULTURE THAT HAS EVER EXISTED HAS HAD AT LEAST THREE COMPONENTS.
529 COMMERCE, GOVERNMENT, AND RELIGION OF SOME SORT.
530 RELIGION IS DEFINED AS A CAUSE, PRINCIPLE, OR SYSTEM OF BELIEFS HELD
531 TO WITH ARDOR AND FAITH.
532 ARDOR IS VERY OFTEN DISPLAYED IN OPINIONS THAT TAKE ON RELIGIOUS UNDER-
533 TONES--LIKE THOSE EARLIER EXPRESSED. ANYHEY, THERE CAN BE MANY OPINIONS
534 BUT ONLY ONE TRUTH.
535 MAY I BE SO BOLD AS TO SHARE ONE TRUTH, EVEN IF IT IS CONTROVERSIAL. 
536 EVERYONE, NO MATTER WHAT FLAVOR THEY ARE, HAS A GOD. AND THOSE THAT 
537 SAY THEY HAVE NONE, MUST REGARD THEMSELVES AS SUCH. LET ME EXPLAIN
538 BEFORE THE LYNCHING STARTS: EVERYONE HAS TO COME TO GRIPS WITH QUESTIONS
539 AS WHAT HAPPENS AT DEATH, WHY ARE WE HERE, WHERE DID WE COME FROM, WHERE
540 IS THIS CHARADE LEADING, WHERE OR WILL IT END, WHAT OR IS THERE A PUR-
541 POSE IN LIFE, ETC. ETC. ETC. SOME CHOSE TO ANSWER THESE THROUGH BELIEFS
542 ALREADY CONSTRUCTED, OTHERS PICK AND CHOOSE, AND OTHERS MAKE THEIR OWN
543 WHICH USUALLY CHANGE MANY TIMES DURING THE COURSE OF ONES LIFE. MAN HAS
544 A SPIRITUAL SIDE THAT CANNOT BE DENIED, AND IS JUST AS REAL AS PHYSICAL
545 APPETITES, AND IN A VERY REAL WAY CANNOT BE IGNORED.

548 Flushed and sweating, the piper calls back to the bard:
549   "Aye, let's do!  Between us two, we'll banish gloom and care!
550 Drink up!, the night is young, and I need oil for my pipes!
551 Your voice is sweet, my friend, your songs joyful.  Sing on and call
552 on me as you wish."

558   Avast!!!!!!
559     Can it be that some wayward course has carried this frail
560     vessel into the midst of the Sargasso Sea.
561     But NO!! as I look again it appears to be more of an enchanted
562     cove, alive with creatures of the imagination.
563     Being but a poor sailor, plying the trade routes searching for
564     paying passengers or cargo enough to support this addiction to
565     the vastness of sea & sky!!!!!!!!!!
566     Following the sound of the beat of Dragon's wings sailed we here
567     in search of that fair maiden who doth 'go between' in search of
568     many adventures. Alas on her last visit to that place of magic
569     who's true name cannot be spoken, she did purchace goods to be
570     delivered forthwith. 
571     The 'Ark' being laden with cargo from various and sundry does
572     seek her presence.
573     Few are the signs of passage to be seen here...only one small
574     burning ember with essence of Dragon Flame....
575     A free cruise to oblivion is offered as reward for information.

578      As he approached the dais, Marc stared in awe at the faintly glowing
579 crystals bound by silver chains to the brows of the sev seated there
580 on the floor.  He remembered again the day Ben had taken him away,
581 that there had been a man there who had worn the star on his brow.  
582 These were the Masters, he realized.  Seven of them here at once.  He
583 could feel the urgent air on expectancy in the hall, and looked around
584 himself once more.  Still nothing but stone cold faces.
585 	     He realized with a start that some exchange had been taking place 
586 between one of the seven, an older woman with slightly graying hair.
587 He hadn't been listening.  The woman turned and addressed him
588 personally.
589 	     "Marcus Birn, step onto the Dais." She intoned as if it were 
590 a ceremony.  He looked up at Ben, hesitant, and was surprised that
591 the stony look had disappeared for a moment to be replaced by one of
592 unexpected tenderness and love.  Marc looked once again into the
593 stone faces around him and started for the dais.******daver*******

597      AS I SUSPECTED, THIS TABLE IS AGAIN IN NEED OF CLEANING.  AND I MUST
598 HURRY, FOR I SEE THAT A NEW TABLE WILL SOON OPEN, AND THIS ONE MUST BE DONE
599 BEFORE IT DOES.
600 
601      I FELT THE PRESENCE OF MY FRIEND d LAST NIGHT, AND HER WORRY.  THOUGH
602 MY EXPERIENCES OF THAT NIGHT WERE INTENSELY PERSONAL, IT WAS A SALVE TO MY
603 MORALE TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS THERE, AND THAT SHE HAS RETURNED TO THESE PARTS
604 FROM HER TRIP TO THAT COASTAL TOWN.  SHE WAS SORELY MISSED, BY BOTH ME AND
605 SIR CISTOP, AND I CELEBRATE HER RETURN GREATLY.  IF SHE COMES TO THE INN
606 THIS EVE, I MUST CERTAINLY LIFT MY DRINK IN HONOUR OF HER PRESENCE.
607 
608      AS I SWEEP THE UNINTENDED REMAINS OF OTHER'S CELEBRATIONS FROM THE
609 TABLE, THERE IS SOME WORRY IN MY MIND.  I HAVE HEARD RUMOURS THAT ANOTHER
610 FRIEND OF MINE, WHO PRESIDES OVER HIS OWN LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT, WAS SEEN
611 SELLING OFF PORTIONS OF THAT PLACE TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER, AND HIS ESTABLISH-
612 MENT IS STILL CLOSED TO VISITORS.  IS HE PLANNING TO CLOSE SHOP FOR GOOD?
613 IS HE MERELY CHANGING THE TOOLS BY WHICH HE RUNS THE SHOP, BUT STILL HAS
614 PLANS TO CONTINUE SERVING THE PUBLIC?  OR WERE THOSE ITEMS JUST EXTRAS, UN-
615 NEEDED AND UNWANTED, CLUTTERING UP HIS HOME AND PREVENTING HIS SHOP FROM ITS
616 EXPECTED REOPENING?  PERCHANCE, IF HE STILL STOPS BY THE INN AND LOOKS AT
617 THIS TABLE WHEN I'VE FINISHED WITH IT, HE MIGHT RESPOND TO MY URGENT QUERY.
618 
619      I LOOK CLOSELY AT THE LEGS OF THE TABLE, THEIR SUPPORTS, AND THOSE OF
620 THE CHAIRS'.  HMMM.....THEY APPEAR IN FINE SHAPE.  THAT IS GOOD, THOUGH I
621 WAS HOPING THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE, AS I WOULD ENJOY AGAIN USING MY NEW TOOL
622 TO FIX THEM.  BUT IT IS JUST AS WELL, SINCE WHEN THESE THINGS ARE IN NEED OF
623 SUCH REPAIR, THEIR TENDANCY TO COLLAPSE CAN CAUSE MANY PATRONS TO WISH TO
624 LEAVE THE INN.  OR EVEN TO LEAVE THE INN MORE QUICKLY THAN THEY HAD HOPED
625 FOR.
626 
627      AH, THE TABLE IS DONE, AND I CAN LEAVE IT FOR CISTOP TO PREPARE AGAIN.
