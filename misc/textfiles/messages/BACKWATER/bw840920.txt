31 This is disturbing - looking back through my copies of the Archives, I
32 have discovered that SEVERAL of my entries have been on here before!
33 The Systems Analyst Final Exam, the Chemereta Community College Schedule,
34 another I can't recall at the moment - this is awful!
35 I admit I am guilty of lifting them from other sources, but RERUNS??!
36 I am aghast!  I am depressed.  My only consolation is that if they were new
37 on BackWater to me, then they were new on BackWater to a majority of the
38 current Inn-goers.
39 I must admit that reading the Archives is both an interesting and a
40 frustrating pastime.  Interesting to see how different yet how similar the 
41 arguments, discussions, and jerks were then and now.  Frustrating because I
42 am reading along, see something that makes me want to respond, but Alas!
43 It's History!  Dr. Who, where are you when I need you?

52   The piper lifted his left arm quickly, snapping off the last wail of the
53 pipes, leaving an aching void of silence behind.  In the sudden silence,
54 a clatter, thump, and a person whom the piper did not recognize made a
55 sudden and definitely ungraceful entrance down the stairs.  Folding the
56 blowpipe and chanter of his pipes in his left hand, the piper picked his 
57 way to the landing at the bottom of the stairs and offered a hand to the
58 new arrival in the common room.  Helping him up and brushing off some of
59 the dust that seemed to have accumulated in Pam's long abscence (oh, how
60 I wish someone else knew those domestic witcherys that prevent dust from
61 settling, wood from warping, and cloudiness from accumulating on glass!)
62 and making sure he was uninjured, helped him to a seat at the table.
63   The innkeeper drew a glass from one of the darkest oaken barrels that
64 sat on trestles behind the bar; the spicy aroma seemed to invigorate the
65 very air of the inn with a sparkle and memory of golden barly nodding
66 its heads as the field rippled under a warm summer breeze.  Taking the
67 glass, the piper sat it before the bruised newcomer and said "Here, this
68 noble draft will help restore your equilibrium!"
69   Turning to the bard, who had just come in holding a book, the piper
70 replied, "Yes, I know the Garyowen ... and a right cheerful tune it is.
71 It's just the thing we need now... perhaps that, and Queen Victoria's
72 Jubilee will put our new friend here in a mood to chat.  He seems to 
73 have something on his mind."  Turning to the newcomer, the piper said,
74 "You'll find a sympathetic ear here, my friend.  We may be short on
75 effective action, but we have sympathy, advice, and opinions aplenty!"
76   Before their new companion could reply, the piper turned with a smile,
77 placed the blowpipe into his mouth, winded the pipes, and launched into
78 the tunes.

90 I am sure we can figure out something interesting to hack together.
91 QuizMaster : Don't let it trouble you too much. Your skills in other areas
92 are much more worth while. While the archives are memories from the past, don't
93 forget those forward thinkers who are trying to make memories for the future.
94 The past is just that, gone, but not forgotten. While we may look upon the
95 past for guidance, it should not rule our lives. I look forward to new and
96 exciting things to happen in the future. I, in part, am trying to forget certain
97 deeds of the past. I am trying to change into, a brand new L'homme! Please
98 take these words and remember them. The next time you feel slightly frustrated,
99 think of others who are worse off than you. And think of those who are trying
100 to improve their own situation, and hopefully the situation of others, for what
101 greater thing can Man but sacrifice himself for others? This message, quite

124 Chorus:Instead of spa we'll drink down ale,
125 And pay the reck'ning on the nail,
126 No man for debt shall go to jail
127 From Garryowen in glory!
128 We are the boys that take delight in
129 Smashing the Limerick lights when lighting.
130 Through all the streets like sporters fighting,
131 And tearing all before us.
132 CHORUS
133 We'll break the windows, we'll break the doors,
134 The watch knock down by threes and fours;
135 Then let the doctors work their cures,
136 And tinker up our bruises.
137 CHORUS
138 We'll beat the bailiffs out of fun,
139 We'll make the mayors and sheriffs run;
140 We are the boys no man dares to dun
141 If he regards a whole skin.
142 CHORUS
143 Our hearts so stout have got us fame,
144 For soon 'tis known from whence we came;
145 Where'er they dread the name
146 Of Garryowen in glory!
147 CHORUS
148 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
149 By the end of the song the entire company was singing (loudly if not
150 very well). Bard looked around and commented to piper, "That's what I like
151 a cheerful place!"

165 He felt very fortunate to have someone take some interest in his checkered past.
166 All of the reasons he had come here to the inn came flooding into his mind like
167 the rushing waters of a river just being freed from the confines of a dam. There
168 were so many things he wanted to say, so many things he wanted to tell, but
169 there remained a twinge repression deep in his soul. Could he retell his story
170 to these kind folks, and keep some semblence of pride within himself? What
171 would their reaction be to his sad story? Piper and the rest seemed to be
172 suspended for a moment, waiting for him to speak. The words came slowly at first,
173 then his voice grew in strength as did the quickness of his speech.
174  "Not...so...long ago...but in a place very much different from this...I 
175 attended a party of sorts. It was unlike anything I had experienced before. The
176 hosts had seemed nice enough at first, but as the evening wore on, they began
177 to change, slowly at first, but there was a definite difference from when I had
178 arrived. They had a large house, set far away from neighbors or main roads, and
179 the only way in or out of the grounds was a single crude roadway that circled
180 the main house. I was not too intent on going when I had first received the
181 invitation, but instead of facing jeers from my drinking companions for not going,
182 I decided to see what all the hoopla was about.
183  Most of us in the village had heard rumors about the 'LO' parties, but no one
184 I knew personally had ever been invited. It was considered quite a honor to
185 even be considered worthy of an invitation to LO. I decided not to pass up the
186 chance to see for myself the mysterious happenings at LO. Which brings me back
187 to our hosts. When I say 'our', I mean myself and the other three people in
188 my 'group'. We all seemed to notice the change. Maybe it was my noticing it first
189 that saved me...I don't really know. Even the time since that evening has not
190 healed the open wound I feel in my soul."
191  And with that, he took up his ale, and let some more of the golden liquid 
192 find its course down his throat, hoping it would help him forget The Evening.
193 The Evening that he could probably never forget. He looked into the eyes of those
194 seated around him, wondering what their opinion of him was, and wondering if 
195 they could help him in any way...

206 Jonathon -
207       Not to long ago you asked a question of identity. I see that not to
208 many have responed to your request. I don't know if you read scifi at all
209 ,but the gap reminds me of a story called 'Moon Moth'. Basically the story
210 told about a culture on another world that would no show their face. As
211 a matter of fact, there was a more that said 'You Must NOT Show Your Face'.
212 I see a parallel here. You are dealing in an alternate culture that see 
213 a benifit in no one knowing (other then those they choose) who they are.
214 I do not wholly understand why this is.

218 CDP: NO, I HAVE NOT READ THAT STORY, BUT I DO REAL A LOT OF SF&F. SOUNDS
219 SIMILAR TO A BUCK RODGERS EPISODE. WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF THAT WORK? THAT STORY
220 IS QUITE APPLICABLE. THE BUCK RODGERS STORY WAS BASICIALLY THE SAME, BUT THE
221 REASON THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT SHOW THEIR FACE WAS THAT EVERYBODY LOOKED THE SAME.
222 OTHER PEOPLE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE THAT EVERYBODY LOOKED LIKE THEM. ALTHOUGH
223 THIS IS S.F., COULD IT BE THAT THE PATRONS HERE DO NOT WANT TO FIND OUT
224 THAT THEY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON? CAN SO FEW PEOPLE SAY, "YOU ARE LIKE ME, IN
225 SOME WAYS, AND I ENJOY IT."?  ANYWAY, I AGREE TOTALLY WITH YOU, AND LOOK FOWARD
226 TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS.
227 
228 RUNNER: DON'T FEEL TOO UPSET. MANY PEOPLE CAME HERE, LOOKING FOR REFUGE
229 FROM SOME PRIOR BAD EXPERIENCES (MYSELF FOR ONE). THE THING TO DO IS TO TRY
230 TO PUT THOSE THINGS BEHIND YOU. DON'T FORGET THEM, JUST REALIZE WHAT HAPPENED,
231 AND USE THAT AS A GUIDE IN THE FUTURE. MEANWHILE, RELAX AND BE REASSURED! YOU
232 WILL FIND MANY FRIENDS AMONG THE ASSEMBLY HERE, AND WE WILL TRY AND MAKE
233 YOUR STAY AS PLEASANT AS POSSIBLE. REMEMBER, CONFUSION SAY:
234 "MAN WHO ALWAYS LOOKS BACK OFTEN TRIPS OVER HIS OWN FEET!"
235 NOW, TALK IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT, OR DON'T IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

237 BARD: A GOOD SONG, BUT ARE YOU IMPLYING ANYTHING BY THAT SONG, THAT BEING THE
238 THEME FROM CUSTAR'S TROOPS? HOW ABOUT SOMETHING TO CHEER UP RUNNER HERE?

242 ENDS.
243 ALL - THERE IS ANOTHER, TRUER, VERSION OF THE TALE THIS BYGONE RUNNER PERSON
244 IS ATTEMPTING TO TELL.  AFTER HE IMPLICATES HIMSELF WITH HIS FOUL LIES,
245 WE SHALL REVEAL WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURED.
246 JONATHON CHANCE - PERHAPS THE GREATEST REASON FOR ANONYMITY ON THIS BOARD IS
247 THAT IT ENABLES THE MESSAGE-ENTERERS TO SAY WHAT THEY 'REALLY' FEEL, UNENCUMBERED
248 BY WHAT THEIR FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES MIGHT THINK.  HOW MUCH OF WHAT YOU
249 SAY IS REALLY WHAT YOU FEEL, RATHER THAN SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN FILTERED
250 BECAUSE OF YOUR AUDIENCE?  MOST PEOPLE TEND TO PHRASE THEIR OPINIONS ACCORDING
251 TO WHO IS RECEIVING IT, SINCE BY PUTTING THINGS IN A MANNER UNACCEPTABLE BY
252 THE RECIEVER, THEY MAY LOSE FRIENDS/EMPLOYMENT.  HERE, ON THE OTHER HAND,
253 THEY MAY SPEAK THEIR MIND, WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRISAL OTHER THAN, AT MOST,
254 NAME-CALLING.  THIS IS THE IDEA BEHING THE SUGGESTION BOX.  GRANTED, PEOPLE
255 LEAVING MESSAGES HERE SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF SIGNATURE, SO RESPONSES MAY
256 BE ADDRESSED EASILY, BUT TRUE NAMES ARE A DEFINITE DETRIMENT ON A BOARD WHERE
257 DIALOGE AND DISCUSSION ARE PREVALENT.  IN SOME WAYS, IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SO
258 MANY OF US KNOW EACH OTHER'S IDENTITIES; IT REDUCES THE ADVANTAGES MENTIONED 
259 EARLIER.

285 Mikey is right about the 'Peltier device', also called a thermoelectric

287 a TE device is a rather neat gizmo.  They are available from at least one other
288 place than CAMBION.  I could look it up if necessary.

290 CDP - I DO NOT CONSIDER IT 'PARANOIA'.  THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE EITHER
291 TOTALLY SELF-CONFIDENT, OR INDIFFERENT TO THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS.  I ADMIT
292 THAT I HAVE NOT REACHED THE EXALTED LEVEL OF THE FORMER, NOR YET SUNK TO
293 THE DEPTHS OF THE LATTER.  I AM A MERE MORTAL, SUBJECT TO THE SAME FAULTS WHICH
294 PLAGUE MOST OF MY PEERS.  IN ORDER TO CO-EXIST WITH THEM, THERE MUST BE 
295 CERTAIN CONVENTIONS TO EASE THE FRICTION.  BLUNT SPEAKING IS NOT ONE OF
296 THESE CONVENTIONS.  ONLY IN SPECIAL SETTINGS CAN TRUE COMMUNICATIONS TAKE
297 PLACE.  BACKWATER, WHILE NOT IDEAL, DOES ENABLE THOSE WHO ARE WILLING, TO
298 APPROACH A MORE HONEST EXCHANGE OF VIEWPOINTS.  I SUGGEST THAT IF YOU NEED
299 TO KNOW THE TRUE IDENTITIES OF THOSE TO WHOM YOU SPEAK, SEEK OUT THE MORE
300 CONSERVATIVE BULLETIN BOARDS SUCH AS CBBS AND BIT BUCKET, WHERE IDENTITIES 
301 ARE DEMANDED AND VERIFIED.  THERE YOU CAN FEEL SAFE, POLITELY EXCHANGING
302 YOUR MEANINGLESS PLEASANTRIES WHILE NOT SAYING ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE AND
303 DEFINITELY NOT INSPIRING THAT MOST DANGEROUS ITEM: CREATIVE THOUGHT.

306 The Lo's -
307      The only thing that I have suggested has that I can question the 
308 emergining rituals of this culture and still try to deal with people
309 on a one-to-one basis. My question is still why people have chosen to
310 deal with others on a level of ambivalence. If i don't have a real feel-
311 ing for who you are how can I engage in constructive 'creative thought'
312 with you? These things do not occur in a vacumn. There has to be at 
313 least a mininum of trust for these things to occur. I understand that
314 many of the people on this board already know each other. I have not had
315 the oppurtunity to meet these people face to face. What you are suggesting 
316 to me is that I can have a better understanding of a person by dealing
317 with them on an impersonal level. Is this really what you are trying to
318 get across? I don't think so. My questions are not meant to be an 
319 attack, only questons.

323    The piper listened intently as the newcomer began his story.  After he 
324 paused, another person remarked in a rather sneering voice that he could tell
325 the 'real' truth.  The piper looked in confusion from one to the other, but
326 finally returned to the newcomer at the table.  "Continue," the piper said.
327 "Let us hear your story in full.  We cannot judge you or your opponent here
328 without facts.  Indeed, who are we to judge?  We welcome, but do not demand
329 your story -- not only yours but your opponents.  We welcome you without any
330 prejudgement, but will judge you on your contributions to our collective 
331 reality.  And oddly enough," the piper said as he sat down, "we can also 
332 accept the one who calls himself Lo -- for it is what you do now, not your 
333 past that matters.  The telling of the tale, not the living that produced
334 the memories is the stuff from which the inn is built.
335 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
336    To the person asking about names --
337 Names have a peculiar and oftimes stulifying power.  To take a name is to
338 take on many of the attributes that that name connotes.  Many of us at the 
339 inn chose names for rather personal reasons, or choose them for a freedom that
340 our mundane names lack.  In addition, should you wish to articulate a point
341 of view that you really would not like to be personally identified with, yu
342 have the complete freedom to choose another name under which to pomulgate your
343 views and defend your position.  (A certain Frank was sure that he used a
344 different name not to long ago, I'm sure!)   If you wish to take part in flights
345 of fancy, you can indicate that by the name you choose.  You can choose to 
346 interact with use under multiple names -- if you have something to say that
347 has several points of view, choose a name for each point of view and show us
348 the complete arguement.  We are not necessarily debating.  There is no

353 CDP : I hate to bring up such mundane trivialities, but if within you burns
354 this overpowering desire to know who is who, and to associate backwater
355 character with real name and face, I encourage you to attend the 2nd almost
356 annual Not Another Pizza Party. The reason it is not annual is that it has
357 only been about 11 months since the last party. Our last gathering was, at least
358 for me, quite successful. It was indeed fun to match backwater personalities
359 with flesh and bone reality. I can't give you the exact date, some other good
360 irregular will have to do that. I can tell you that the location is the MT
361 Bottle and Deli, which is a nice little deli over near Jantzen Beach.
362 MIKEY : I seem to recall you saying something about not being in the party
363 mood. Is this true? It sould be nice to have the guest of honor at the NAPP.
364 I bet the rest of us can even pool our resources to buy you your meal and one
365 of those fine ales the MT is so famous for. Instead of the innkeeper, you can
366 be the innkeepy for awhile. Wadaya say???
367 LO : My you seem like a rather spitefull person. Is your reaction to stories
368 always so strong, or is this some sort of special case? You seem to be taking
369 a different tack from the others...
370 Aaron : Any progress? And would you please turn that stereo down!!!

383 Hello, It seems that messages scroll through this system fairly quickly.
384 I presume that means you have to be on just about everyday to be able to use
385 it successfully. Nicht wahr? That's time consuming! And a problem for anyone
386 who has a busy schedule. Perhaps this system is not for some people.
387 Anyway, I took a file copy of the messages from top and I will peruse them
388 to determine if there is anything worth responding to. Otherwise, take care!

391 Well, the only thing I did see of interest was the debate on names.
392 Consider it logically, a name is a pointing device. It is a means of
393 identifying a known individual (or, better perhaps, a known persona).
394 If you behave in some given fashion while under the assumption of some
395 name, then that manner of behavior is the person identified with that
396 name. If you switch names to often then each of the identities becomes
397 a mere chimera - an apparition of no substance. On the other hand, if you
398 switch between to modes of behavior while using a single name, then you
399 are inconsistent and people will think you to be slightly schiziod. 
400 The only proper way to live is to keep your multiple identities consisten
401 with the name you have chosen for each.
402 
403 Now it is possible to have several pointers all identifying the same object.
404 In this case, you have a single individual with many names. For the most
405 part, this is a common occurrence. I know of an individual who was known
406 to some as "Mom", to others as "Julia", others as "Mrs. Smith", and others
407 as that "!@#$%^&* :?~+*&#%$@" [does obscenity offend anyone here? if so
408 please delete the reference to :?~+*&#%$@]. In this ladies case, there
409 were two identities - each of which had two persona.
410 
411 For a while I spent some time thinking about the sociological value of
412 names. How often have we associated name with reputatation. To me, they
413 are synomynous. My name is of value. And there are other times when I
414 would prefer anonymity. Yes, I sometimes wish to hide my actions. Not so
415 much because I am ashamed of them, but because I interface to a world that
416 does not have sufficient understanding and perspective to appreciate all
417 of me. Many of the people who I must deal with professionally would never
418 understand a certain weekend in Texas.
419   There is a lot more to add to this subject. But I should not monopolize
420 (or is it, monologue). Besides, there are some important efforts to get
421 done today.   Take care all.

424 TROLL:  Your comment about calling in every day to get on.  Yes, if you
425       want to be like CDP call in every 5 minutes to see if there is a
426       new message then you can reply to it.
427         Names are important, I should know a little on this matter since
428       I have had about 30-35 names on this board alone along with boarders.
429       It is nice to meet a person face to face and it might be just the
430       opposite too.  It would be good to go to something like a 'Pizza Party'
431       to see the people on Backwater.  I think something like that could help
432       a lot.  But the people in this system probably wouldn't agree with what
433       I have said and probably don't care either.
434 CDP:    Just one question, why do you call so many times in one day?  Do you
435       think that your interests are much more important than everyone else?
436       Just why DO you call so much?

441 ALL - If it will not be vandalized, here is another comment about the 
442       N.A.P.P. (Not a pizza party, a name coined by the innkeeper last
443       year in view of the general quality of food at pizza restaurants)
444       The time selected (or suggested) was 1900 on 5-OCT-1984 at the
445       MT bottle and deli.  Let us see a show of hands.  (One per body
446       please, not one per name.  Last time six people showed up and
447       only took one chair.  Big Bill Broozy, I believe)
448 
449 MIKEY - I agree, someone, or a collection of someones, will find the funds
450         to purchase one of the reuben's that MT is famous for, as well as
451         a stout or to (or three or four).  It was interesting last time,
452         I am sure it would be this time.
453 
454 RISKERS - Are there six who would like to play ?  I know of one.  If there
455           are 5 others, we can then decide on a board to play on and other
456           important info.
457 
458 ALL - Read the editorial cartoons in The Sunday Oregonian.  Quite amusing,
459       albeit sad.

491 Prometheus - Control Space is 1AH?  That is normally considered Control Z.
492 In any case, it is a normally non-displayed character (for me), but I have set up
493 my terminal program to print out a certain graphics character when encountering ^Z.
494 On the other hand, if I download the file, then read it using most of my text
495 reading programs, ^Z causes a line feed.  If that is one of the control characters
496 that get removed when Mikey moves the file to DB, then that is no problem either.
497 All in all, I have no real negative feelings about your using X'1A' as your delay character.
498 (there are some I would prefer, but we can't please everyone).
499 I glanced thru the Oregonian section you mentioned (trying to see what
500 I'm missing out on), but I didn't look closely enough to notice you.  Outside of the
501 settings in which I am used to seeing you, I probably wouldn't recognize you anyway.

518 Prometheus: Please do *NOT* use ^Z as the delay character. It can cause 
519 far too many problems on my Model 100. (It can terminate my connection, or 
520 if I'm downloading with the WRONG program setup it can scramble my file
521 pointers!)
522 NAPP: 10/05/84 sounds ok to me...
523 CDP: I can't remember any names at the moment, but MANY cultures believe 
524 that knowing someone's "true name" gives you mystical power over them 
525 Also, WHY do you equate not knowing someone's "real" name with "impersonal
526 interaction"? I knew a close friend for YEARS before I found out that his
527 real name was not what I'd know him by (he was known by a nickname because 
528 he'd been named after his father).
529 By your reasoning pen pals are impersonal relationships, after all,
530 they haven't met face to face!

533 Most definately DO NOT use the control Z! It happens to be the clear
534 screen character for over 25% of the microcomputers in existance!
535 A rather large number of terminals generate a null (00) if you do a
536 control space. Most notible ADM3A's and many DEC terminals.
537 Personally, I vote for using the control C.
538 I might also point out that the control Z happens to be the end of file
539 marker for CPM systems, which I am sure a number of people would very
540 disturbing to be randomly ploped around in their files.

554 Milchar was in a hurry.  Astral travel, while tiring, was the fastest mode 
555 available.  There was so much that was happening at the Inn that Milchar had 
556 difficulty tracing all of the thought patterns in the ether.  Maybe Voyeur 
557 would help fill in a few of the scetchy areas since his last contact, about
558 a week or so ago as time runs in one reality.
559 Nearing his destination, Milchar grasps the Amulet and concentrates.... and
560 S->H->I->F->T->S into the Inn's reality... in one of the darker corners of 
561 the common room.  The first thing that Milchar noted was that the Inn was 
562 in a state of disrepair.  He found the reason floating at the top of the 
563 Innkeeper's conscience: Pam was nowhere to be found.  Milchar was saddened.
564 Piper had just finished a tune.  Mayhap that was what speeded his arrival.
565 Just then, Milchar spied Voyeur at the far side of the room, near Piper...
566 +++++++++++++++++
567 So much to say, so little time to say it... it's now 11:33 pm on 9/16/84, 
568 and I have to go to school tomorrow... I would like any/all information on
569 N.A.P.P. on the 5th, as I don't know exactly where it is.  The ComputerFair 
570 sounds good, and a story about the Ruby Valley to come...

574 As near as I can tell, the MT Bottle & Deli (the site of the NAPP), is
575 at 11925 N Center,  which I believe is somewhere in the vicinity of Jantzen Beach.
576 (that is Definitely outside of my normal stomping grounds, so I am guessing
577 based on what I vaguely recall reading in the Archives of the first NAPP).
578 The time/date so far seems to be Friday, October 5th Post Mortem.
579 Currently, the big hangup seems to be trying to bribe Mikey to attend.
580 MiG: I believe that Jonathon Chance was merely asking that people put SOME
581 identification on their messages.  Remember how hard it was to address [*=*] ?
582 Then, it was CDP who entered the arena and started the discussion
583 on the use of TRUE identities.  I have thoughts on the matter, but voyeur is
584 NOT the personna I use for discussions/debates/arguements.  I shall remove
585 this hat and put on one more appropriate for the subject.
586 (as [I think it was piper] mentioned, some of us have personnas for different
587 purposes.  We are all two-dimensional people here, not well-rounded.
