22 deserved. Long-time precedence does not make one kind or even uncruel. It just 
23 prevents those who have been cut from responding or ever entering again. Would

28 Backwater users:A call for help for a friend who owns a dinosaur. It seems he 
29 was interested in computers before computers were interesting and bought himself
30 this dinosaur called:Heathkit H8 or H89 or whatever. Any how he has been 
31 smitten with the telecommunications bug and unfortunately there is no cure
32 other than to give in to the urge. BUT unfortunately, his dinosaur has a very
33 hard time digesting modeming without a term program(of which he has none) but=
34 in one of his old dust covered catalogs it talks of one called a MCS Modem term
35 program #885-105x(Heathkit was real good with numbering everything) so if any
36 of you great BW users knows of a term program that would work on his dinosaur
37 it would be much appreciated. I want to see this friend get his "fix" real
38 soon so that he can be as crazy as the rest of us. I don't know what works with
39 dinosaur but there must be something(outside of the museums) that will make his 
40 machine talk with the boards. Any assistance would be much appreciated. 
41 Thank you

43 P.S. His name is Leon and he can be reached at 774-xxxx. OR leave me a message
44 here at the INN. Thanx again.

57      It was a strange February for this land from what those who have
58 resided here long have told me, certainly a rare gift to be cherished to
59 find such warmth and pleasant dryness under the deep blue skies of winter.
60 Memories of the last two winters jumped unbidden to mind, the coldness of
61 the rain arguing with the grey skies for first place in the race to depress
62 the spirits, but each laughing secretly over the green surprises they had
63 in store for all in later months.  Ah, but this February!  Surely a month
64 to be remembered, catalogued, filed and then pulled forth again and again
65 from the stacks of memories lodged in the halls and upon the shelves of the
66 mind.

67      Gears complain raucously as I attempt to shift from the 4th to the 5th
68 position, finally they engage with a oddly reluctant rattle, and I push my
69 ancient Schwinn LeTour forward toward the extinct volcano known to we 
70 current inhabitants of this land as Mt. Tabor.  I wonder to myself what it
71 was known as to those who lived here before, but this thought leaves my mind
72 as I return to watching the world as it moves by.  There is an elderly man
73 tending to the bed of his recently trimmed rosebushes, while nearby some
74 children play a joyful and noisy game in happy celebration of spring come
75 early.  I think of stopping and joining them, but the unfortunate realities
76 of being an adult crowd such thoughts from my mind, and I settle into a
77 sullen melancholy as I begin the long climb to the top of the hill.  Oh
78 Peter Pan, where were you when I was young?  Wendy was a fool.

79      It seems like days later when I finally reach the park at the top,
80 covered with sweat and legs shaking from the effort needed to bring me
81 here.  And once here I see that half the cars and a majority of the
82 teenagers in this part of town have decided that this is a great place to
83 come on such a nice day; the park is crowded with them, as well as the
84 occasional police car that inevitably shows up where any group of the young
85 larger than twenty appears.  Strangely enough, the police don't seem to
86 take notice of the obvious smell of marijuana in the air, concentrating
87 instead on reducing the volume of the stereos.  I knew that there was going
88 to be quite a congregation here when I arrived, since I had spent much of
89 the climb avoiding the cars speeding by and ignoring the suggestive remarks
90 that sometimes came from the open windows.  Cruising slowly to regain my
91 strength and wind, I once again ignore the remarks as I pass by; I guess
92 I'm supposed to be either impressed or flattered.  They don't realize that
93 the emotions I feel are a combination of disgust and fear.  For once I wish
94 I looked older than I do, maybe they'd leave me alone.

95      The statue of a bald headed gentleman stands as he must have stood for
96 years, flaunting his age with the green of oxidation.  He appears intent on
97 his purpose, and he is pointing back the way I've come as if advising me to
98 return in that direction.  But the grass beneath him is soft and inviting,
99 and I would prefer to rest just a bit before I try to go back down the long
100 hill.  Yes, it is soft.  I can smell the chlorophyll of the grass, hear the
101 wind in the trees above, the sun beats down on me with a warmth that is so
102 relaxing.

103      I awaken with a start, I didn't intend to fall asleep!  I jump up
104 quickly, it has gotten chilly now and the sun is much lower than before.
105 Darn, I won't be home before dark now, and I don't have a light of any sort.
106 I grab my bike and walk it down toward the paved street a few feet below
107 my unintended bed.  Strangely enough, the street isn't there.  And I see
108 now that the grass isn't neatly trimmed as I remember, it's long and filled
109 with weeds.  It seems that the entire world around me has changed, or else
110 my perception of it has been altered.

111      I try to extend my senses, but nothing happens.  Obviously this isn't
112 where I was before, and it isn't Inisfall or else I would sense the Inn and
113 its energy.  But where could I be?  Wherever I am, it is totally unfamiliar
114 in feeling, and not pleasant.  As I survey this strange world around me, I
115 see that there is one familiar object: the statue remains, but it seems to
116 be subtley changed.  Perhaps it is just my imagination, but it seems to be
117 smiling.

127     "How long will it take?" he asked, squatting beside the edge of the water.
128     "I'm not sure" was the soft answer,"The water's very warm and I don't 
129 weigh much.  Probably not long."
130     He looked up into the sky.
131     She smiled up at him and streached as she felt the warmth of the water
132 around her.  The rock she sat on was a foot or so beneath the surface and the
133 sun kept the pond quite warm.  Even the little stream running down to the 
134 house would feel warm this late in the day.
135     She looked up at him again, this time he met her eyes.
136 
137     "This doesn't have to happen you know." he said.
138     She tipped her head back, resting it on the grass of the bank.
139     "I need you here." he said, his eyes were fixed on the ground now.
140     Without turning her head she spoke.  "You don't.  You only fear being alone
141 with your feelings.  You have learned much about yourself while I have been 
142 here, now you must learn to be yourself."
143     He thought about her words.  He did not understand all she said.  It was a
144 credit to her teaching that he did not let his questions force his words.
145     "You know the ways of a Speaker." she reminded.
146     "I am not ready."
147     "But you are."
148     His eyes met hers, firmly this time.  "Speak for me now, before...."
149     She smiled.  Her hand moved up through the warm water.  She lifted it to
150 his face and gently touched his forehead.  Her eyes closed and for a moment
151 her lips moved without sound.
152     "You fear..."
153     "You fear my parting will leave you less of who you are.  That somehow
154 without a Speaker you will not be heard, or that your words will fall only on
155 the uncaring."  Her voice was soft, almost a whisper, and flowed as thought 
156 she were reading from a page, flowed like the small stream caressing the rocks
157 a few feet away.  "Your words are so important to you.  So much pride you have,
158 so much fear.  Fearing more your own goals that anything else.  The one person
159 you cannot live with disappointing is yourself."
160     "You fear that you will not miss me as much as you should." she said.  He
161 closed his eyes at this.
162     "You think I will be hurt if you do not hurt enought, and that people will
163 see you as uncaring."
164     She took her fingers from his forehead, leaving small drops of water on his
165 brow.  One slid down and mixed with his tears.
166     "I am a Speaker." she said, placing her arm back into the water.
167     "I have Spoken." he said, completing the ceremony.
168     For a long time the only sound was the stream making its was down the hill.
169     "I WILL miss you." he said.
170     "And it will be enought." she answered.
171     He rocked backward and sat on the soft grass.
172     "You will learn to look inside yourself as I can look into you, the first
173 step is knowing there is something there to find." she said.
174     He looked at her for a long time.
175     "How do you feel? he asked, looking at the water around her.
176     "Soon now I think.  You can go."
177     "I should stay with you." he said.
178     "But you don't want to," she said, "you don't have to prove your feelings
179 to a Speaker."
180     He stood and turned away.
181     "Good-bye." she said.
182     He walked down the hill to the house.  He could find no words.
183     But he will, she thought, he will.

187 "Some people don't take credit for something that good sometimes. 
188 I don't know why," I said to the White Knight over the phone as I
189 finished reading what was left before me. 
190 "But why? I mean that stuff was really good!"
191 "I don't know. But I wish I did..."  #I wish I did...#
192 "Has there been others like that?"
193 "Yes, but I think this one is new. The writer isn't new, but
194 the story is. It's patron I'm pretty sure," I said.

198     Writer of Single Lined Wisdom (for I know no other name for you): Are 
199 you sure it is amdient? Encompassing all? For it seems that is only half...
200 and it's contrast always finds notoriety, falling past without proper 
201 recognition. It seems to me... Anyways, if you are thee who has wrote those
202 othe single phrases standing alone: they have been noticed, pondered, and
203 enjoyed, just thought I'd say.
204     Gaurdian: And why was it of empty rooms?
205     Milchar: Have you concluded, then, that Melissa and Alchemist are dead
206 and buried forever? I had hoped otherwise... it seems that the price for 
207 fallen masks is death... unfortunate.
208     One who takes swift flight and is so akin to the ground that you
209 can move silently across it, with small accustome paws: Although I have 
210 never see you write stories or poems or such as that (not knowing if you do
211 scribe such enjoyable things as many others here do), although I know you 
212 not well, it seems I must give you welcoming back or something of similar
213 greetings. For some reason, your presence known to me is somewhat pleasing.
214 There followed reasons, but I have forgot them now... oh, well
215     All: The days have tended onwards since last I spoke, for it seems my 
216 words have been voiced by someone else or swallowed in my throat. Never-the-
217 less, I have sat here amongst Shadows, observing all which could I see.
218 Now, I take to light momentarily before resigning again to my Shadows. But,
219 as I am here, I would say what has drawn me. I must give you all my regards
220 and compliments. Your writings have been enjoyed by me. Ashamed, I am for not
221 doings so in a better way. But, anyways, this goes to all. Don't think
222 otherwise or personally exclude yourself or you shall give me a guilt trip,
223 okay? Anyways, once again, thank you... it is enjoyed by myself and I am sure
224 many others, as well. -Tanya

228 ==========================================
229 White Knight - at least you should give the people credit for what they
230 do...  Yes, I too have that same book, the same one you have.  I don't
231 mind seeing that story typed in, it's a nice story, but the person who
232 realy wrote it isn't you.  Please give credit to the authors that write
233 the stories.  Especialy when you make it look like that, then blaming it
234 on line noise...
235 ==========================================
236 --------------------------------------
237 To the person erasing my markers:
238 could you please stop?  By erasing the
239 marker, you cause me to take up more
240 time finding the point where I left
241 off.  This wasted time could have been
242 used by others with more talent to
243 write more entries.  I don't know why
244 you are killing them off, but please
245 cease.  Thank you.

277 Either White Knight indeed has a line noise problem, or he is hitting
278 control keys this system doesn't filter out--there's a 14 embedded in
279 one line that turns my cursor on and throws my printer into double-width
280 character mode.  There's no way mere misspelling could have put it
281 there.  Guess I'll have to add some input filters myself....

285   From Prometheus; Scitzoid
286   As for the subject of markers being apt for use on the system and such:
287   I am not in agreement with the arguement posed by Mad Max, although he was in
288 the right as far as having his messages deleted and everything.
289   If you are worried about the time used by you in locating your last line read
290 then do you not care about the wasted disk space? I know that a scratch pad can
291 be easily used to mark a last line, and what is more is that it takes no time
292 or space to use.
293 
294   If you are so worried over the amount of time, then please become a little
295 more worried about the amount of space. It is only fitting. No?

298 white knight, why is ther so much noise anyway? do you play the stereo really
299 loud or something? if so, then turn it down. it shhould stop all the line noise
300 and screwed up characters. i enjoyed the story introduction, and please do try
301 to continue with it. but post a little line saying where you got it from, and
302 where it was published from, and all that. written permition from the publisher

307      THE DEEP SPACE PROBE WAS RETURNING FROM IT'S FLIGHT IN TO THE COLD
308 DEPTHS OF SPACE WHEN THE FLASHANG RED DOT OF THE HOMING SIGNAL
309 OF THE MAIN BASE APPEARED ON THE PILOTS SCREEN. THE PILOT OF THIS GRACEFULL
310 FIGHTING MACHINE WAS TANIS. HE WAS YOUR AVERAGE BROWN HAIRED, HAZEL EYE WARRIOR,
311 BUT HE CARRIED MORE STATUS THAN MOST OF THE OTHER FLYERS. HE HAD COMMAND
312 OF HIS OWN WING.
313      AS HE ENTERED THE OUTER LIMITS OF THE DEFENCE SCREEN THE 
314 FAMILIAR VOICE OF THE MASTER COMPUTER ASKED FOR HIS IDENTIFICATION CODE.
315 AFTER TANIS ENTERED THE MULTI-DIGIT CODE IN HIS COMPUTER THE VOICE REPLIED,
316 "YOU ARE CLEAR TO LAND ON STRIP ONE, BAY THREE."
317      TANIS GUIDED THE SLEEK, SILVER FIGHTER INTO THE BAY AND LEAPED
318 TO THE GROUND. HIS MUSCULAR BODY SEAMED TO SLICE THROUGH
319 THE AIR AS HE RAN. HE RAN FOR WHAT SEAMED LIKE MILES OF CORRIDORS AND 
320 PASSAGES, UNTIL HE FOUND THE WALLS TURNING A RED COLOR. THIS MEANT THAT
321 HE WAS CLOSE TO THE COMMAND CENTER. HE PULLED OUT HIS COM-LINK AND PUNCHED
322 IN THE ACCESS CODE FOR THE CENTER. AS HE ROUNDED THE NEXT CORNER THE BLAST DOORS
323 SLID APART AND TANIS RAN, PANTING, INTO THE CONTROL ROOM.
324      "SIR! I HAVE AN URGENT REPORT!", TANIS SAID OUT OF BREATH.
325       THE COMMANDER WAS A TALL, ELDERLY MAN AND AN EXPERIANCED WARRIOR. HIS  NAM
326 WAS PAX. "YES, WHAT DID YOU FIND?", QUESTIONED THE MAN.
327      "I FOUND A SIZEABLE TASK FORCE HEADED THIS WAY."
328      "CURIOUS, I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD ATTACK AT SUCH AN 
329 AN EARLY DATE. VERY WELL," THE COMMANDERS FACE REFLECTED  AMAZEMENT BUT
330 SELF CONTROL MASKED THE FEAR THAT HE FELT.
331      "SOUND BLUE ALERT. BATTLE CONDITIONS." THE COMPUTER WENT INTO AN AUTOMATIC
332 MODE AND CALLED  CREWS TO THEIR STATIONS.
333       IN THE MAIN BAY  THE LARGE FIRE SUPPORT SHIPS WERE  BEING
334 READIED FOR BATTLE. THERE WERE HOSES AND MEN RUNNING ALL OVER THE BAY, MAKING^G
335 THE WHOLE FLOOR LOOKING LIKE ONE SOLID GRAY MASS.
336 PILIOTS WERE RUNNING TO THEIR  CRAFTS AND LAUNCH GREWS WERE CHECKING BOMBS
337 AND FULE LEVELS. WAVES OF SHUTTLES WERE TAKING PERSONEL TO VARIOUS TASKS THAT
338 NEEDED TO BE COMPLEETED FOR THE DEFENCE, IN THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT
339 AN ENEMY SHIP SHOULD GET PAST THE FLEET.
340      THE ORDER FOR LAUNCH CAME AND THERE WAS A DEAFENING ROAR OF
341 ENGINES STARTING UP. THE CRUSIERS SLOWLY CAME UP TO POWER AND ROSE OFF THE
342 GROUND. THEY WERE OFF TO SPACE, AND BATTLE........

344 THIS IS AN ORGINAL STORY. I HAVE THE MODEM UNDER A PILLOW AND THE COVERS
345 TO TRY TO AVOID THE NOISE. BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE IS STILL SOME INTERFIANCE.
346 Do you think that noise is also tampering with his spelling? I don't think so.
347 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
348 To Prometheus: point well taken.
349 
350 To author of above unsigned comment: even if the line noise is not at fault,
351 what does it really matter?  It seems strange to me that some people judge the
352 entries here on the basis of the correctness of the spelling.  I judge entries
353 on the content, not acording to grammer.  Spelling and other such skills are
354 feats of memorization, and are not rare abilities.  Being able to create works
355 of fiction, on the other hand, is something that not all are able to do.
356 Since this is not a classroom, or a job setting, why do you insist on judging 
357 the entries as if it were?  Why not just read the entries and enjoy them for

361 To person above saying that it isn't important to get permission from a 
362 publisher before copying material. It most certainly is, that is what the
363 copyright laws are all about. You shall not copy someone elses work without
364 their permission period, NO EXCEPTIONS! Besides, it is generaly considered
365 bad form to copy someone elses work anyway. Copying someone elses work is
366 hardly being creative. If you must waste time on the system writing something,
367 at least put something on that is new. Copyright lecture is now over...

370     Not being one to repeat an entrance over and over again, my name is, well,
371 Prometheus Hawthorne and I did mention something about the copyrightlaws being
372 only the slightest bit ignorable in this case.
373     I only meant that there were going to be no agents waiting for you at your
374 school next morning.  I meant it in a slight versiion of humor, and comradery.
375     Have you never spoken that way, as if "No one here tells things to agents"
376 or something like that?  Is it not a sign of friendship sometimes, and even of
377 acceptance of apologies?  Aw, c'mon, there may be nameless agents lurking here
378 and their, but I was only talking to a friend.  And not for them to listen in.
379 
380     About it being considered bad form to enter in the work of someone else, I
381 was under the impression that the story was a direct copy of a book somewhere.
382 And that there was no substitution or rewriting going on.  At least at the
383 time I left that message.  Otherwise, I agree.  When people try to steal some
384 other characters, it is bad form and damned lacking in genuinity to the actual
385 stories too.
386 
387     What I mean by stealing, is borrowing and not telling, seems proper to me.
388     Copyright selective subversion and deplacement lecture over now.

391 BRAVO Prometheus, stand by your standards!!!!
392 You're a 100% right FRED, stick by your guns.
393 Oh mercy me, where can she be?
394 The one that loves those black and white cookies.
395 I love to watch, I love to see,
396 the words and the prose of kathyd!
397 I am heartbroken as anyone can see.
398 I know I'll see her again, hopefully!
399 PAM-You're terrific!!!(almost as good as kathyd)
400 To the writer with no pen name, I think you're doing well also, I wish that I
401 had the talent you have shown here at the INN.
402 SySOp Mikey, thanx for the offer, if you get a chance give Leon a ring at :
403 774-xxxx. Leon is my friend(me THOR)_God that looks stoic doesn't it?
404 ME THOR, ME AM MODEM USER, ME AM STUPID!
405 Jesus, got to get out of that mode, brains go right to peanut butter. I feel
406 like I should be putting a pinch of snuff or something gross into my mouth 
407 when I start typing in that mode. Please excuse this simple user. Well enough
408 of my lingering. Got to leave room for more of those great writers.

410      I am a creature of the night.  My eyes see only the darkness.  As I sit
411 here in the sunlight, it all seems so distant.  I wonder why I keep going
412 back... haven't I proved enough?
413 
414      It seems the only way I can help myself is by helping someone else.
415 How selfish of me.
416 
417      As I shuck off the layers of my soul like a dry yellow onion, I feel
418 the strength I've built up over the years begin to drain away.  It's as if
419 my body is saying, "Listen Buster, you ain't taking me along on this
420 adventure.  I'm going home, open a brew and catch the Celtics' game on the
421 tube."
422 
423      I've discovered the perfect perpetual motion machine.... loneliness.
424 The deeper you sink, the less inclined you are to pull yourself out.
425 
426      At times, fantasy seems all too real to me... and reality but a vision.
427 
428      A wise person once compared love to a hat.  My only problem is that the
429 blasted thing is stuck on my head.  If things don't work out, do I cut it 
430 off or put another hat on top of it?
431 
432      Sometimes, I wish I could reach out, take her hand, and say, "Let me
433 show you the path."  I can't though.  She has to find her own way.  Who 
434 knows, her path may not lead to my garden... but I hope it does.
435 
436      Once upon a time, I faced down an armed gunman.  Now I'm facing myself.
437 Give me the gunman any day.
438 
439      Whatever happens, my journey will leave me a better person.  But damn,
440 those first steps are a bitch.

444     The moon was peaking out between the clouds as Marci and Tony drove to
445 the Peter Pan warehouse.  They parked the benz with no back window a couple
446 of blocks away and proceded on foot.  The two darkly dressed chariters were
447 silent as they approached the building, each engrossed in their own thoughts
448 and expectations. The dock door had been left open as arranged, and the pair
449 entered without trouble. Waiting in the office untill 23 minutes past the 
450 hour they watched the night guard stroll by. He was soon out of site and
451 Tony opened the door and they both slid into the darkness. Marci had the 
452 floor plan in her hand, Tony the flashlight and they got their bearings in
453 the huge building. 
454     "It looks like the stairway to the second floor should be just around
455 this post" Marci said.
456   They turned and sure enough their it was, up they went 4 flights of stairs
457 to the second floor.(tall ceilings in this place..) Tony left the stairwell
458 first and  replied in a hushed excited voice.
459     "Bingo!"
460    Marci followed to see what Tony had observed, the floor has huge and
461 covered with huge stainless drums standing 15 feet high with little steel
462 ladders attached to each container.
463     "This will be a cince." Tony grinned and continued "Lets get to work and
464 get out of here"
465     It took about 4 and 1/2 hours to complete the job. Twice they had to 
466 scurry for darkness due to unexplained noises. But only staying untill their
467 fears were calmed and then back to work. All of the "Jimmy's" but 10 had 
468 been used and Marci carefully packed them out with her. They were out of the
469 building much faster than they came in and were soon in the Benz on the 
470 way home. 
471    Both our criminals were thirsty so they pulled into a 7/11 and bought
472 soda pops and chips, Just for the heck of it Marci bought 5 lotto tickets.
473 saying "If I win, we all share" Tony smiled and said "Ok Marci, Ill hold
474 you to that."

490 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (the way...)
491    It was on purpose that I took a slow gait towards the far door, I had hoped
492 to be stopped before I could reach the weathered door that would surely mean
493 my departure for other fields. Talk caught my ear as to how the passing of new
494 information and wisdom was being taken. It seemed to some that the tale telling
495 at the Inn was at one of the slowest. The Innkeeper had almost finished his
496 unending chores of the day only to find a new stack of empty goblets appear
497 before him on the smoothly polished counter of the never empty lounge.
498 "Never comes the day..." he could be heard saying to himself in jest.
499 Those that could not, or would not, comprehend the passages of the day could
500 have been well advised to listen well the first time and save the tale for a
501 an even slower day. Reference to a person of Sagely manner had been understood
502 to say that "it didn't mean anything" to the person yet. (Take the time to
503 read it when you are able. It does have meaning, L.P.)
504    Some one had meant for me to stop by their table for a moment by making a
505 counter-remark to a statement I had just made about the castings of insults.
506 (Insult to injury at times, it seemed.) I had not stopped when I had heard 
507 the words meant for my ears, and had lost sence from which direction it had
508 originated.   If only I would learn to take these things in stride, and 
509 reply with the best of my manners. At times I would feel proud of what I had
510 so foolishly said, only to realize how I had stumbled.
511    I shall say it here before I forget once more.  Words are my tool, alas they
512 are also my weapon. I use them all too quickly at times. At times they say what
513 I feel but miss in translation, at others they don't quite express what I want
514 but say it exactly. Was that clear? I think not. Some one understands I hope.
515    There are many things that I long to say if only the proper questions 
516 would be asked of me...  Am I automaton?
517    I stopped and met with the Inkeepers gaze, my hand pointing a single fingre
518 to the air. His nod meant he knew I would stay awhile longer...
519 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
520    Why is it of the "empty rooms"? Woe be it that it was a double entendre.
521 The first is not an explaination, only a sigh and a smile. (my {our} secret.)
522 The other explains that I feel my ability to emote is lacking...
523 I have said too much.

550 To analyze a motion picture: Does it diminish the enjoyment of a film? A true
551 student of the cinema will say 'No!'  Watch a film the first time for enjoyment
552 and pleasure. Go back and watch it again and again to appreciate what is going
553 on. Re-expose yourself to film.
554 
555 Ask questions:	Did I like the film?
556 		Why did I like or dislike the film?
557 		Was the film used as a creative device or as a recording
558 		device?
559 		Did the subject lend itself to motion pictures?
560 
561 		What was the film? Dramatic? Documentary? Poetic/abstract?
562 
563 Any good film has at least one strong person behind it. Was it the
564 director or an actor or the producer?
565 
566 Think about these four subjects: Camera work, editing, sound, and acting.
567 
568 Camera work : What kind of camera was used (Cinemascope)?
569 	      Why were certain angles used?
570 	      How was light used within each scene?
571 	     What kind of movement took place in each scene?
572 
573 Editing     : Many say the editor makes or breaks the film.
574 	      Did you notice the editing? You shouldn't...
575 	      How was the pacing? Even? Uneven?
576 	      Could you understand the film without sound?
577 
578 Sound	    : Was the dialog understandable?
579 	      Did the music support or distract?
580 	      Were the sound effects appropriate?
581 
582 Acting	    : Rate the overall performance. Believable?
583 	      Examine costumes, props, sets; Do they work in the film?
584 
585 	Tips : Study the past work, if available, of the director. He is
586 	       the person most responsible for the film. For comparisons,
587 	       look at the work of some masters like D.W. Griffin, John
588 		John Ford, Frank Kapra, and John Huston.
589 
590 Above all, enjoy. Motion pictures are around because of the time lag in our
591 visual systems; Imagine such a tiny thing making possible such a spectacular
592 thing.

597      Hmmmm... years have passed since I've entered the Inn wearing the
598 robes of a warrior Prince.  I see that a curiously familiar feline peeks
599 shyly from the corner.
600      Pray tell, sleek one, why not take your accustomed place on the
601 mantle, lest some drunken oaf step on your tail?

603 Mad Max : I know you can't judge the book by it's cover, but it's hard to
604 	  see the content when you have to study each word and figure out
605 	  what he is trying to say.  It becomes more of a hastle than pleasure.
606 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
607 To above: that is very true.  It does tend to reduce the pleasure of reading
608 the material.  What I don't support is cutting down the new authors over such 
609 things.  The spelling and gammer of the users seems to get better
610 as the authors contine to enter their work.  I think the newer authors should 
611 be given the chance to get started before the other users start putting them 
612 down about it.  I may have come on a little too strong in my last entry, and 
613 for that, I am sorry.  It just bugs me when a new writer get nothing but put
614 downs.  That kind of thing tends to discourage other new users from entering
615 their own work.
