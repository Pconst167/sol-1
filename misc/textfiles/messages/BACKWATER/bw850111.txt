25     Tony walked past the doorway where Jack stood, Jack waited the normal
26 10 seconds and followed.  Tony turned to the right and entered a gay bar,
27 finding himself a seat at the rear of the bar (against the wall) he waited.
28 Jack soon found Tony and had a seat himself. (against the wall)
29     The music was slow and several couples were on the dance floor moving
30 suductively to the tune.  The server came and the men ordered Lone Stars.
31 Tony:  do you have the info?
32 Jack:  right here(he slips Tony a piece of paper)
33 Tony:  when are the girls going to get here?
34 Jack:  they are due at 03:00.
35     Tony examines the crowd for spies and then reads the information Jack
36 had hacked from the Sea First account Database. Satisfied he folds the paper
37 and puts it in his pocket. ( the zippered one with the lock) After what seems
38 like forever the server swishes up with the brews. Jack whips out his clout.
39 (err visa)
40 Server:  do you boys want to start a tab?
41 Jack:    yes, I think it's called for tonight, my date and I are celebrating.
42 Server:  oh, anything special?
43 Tony:    well, no we aren't ready to make the announcement yet. ( winking at
44          Jack)
45 Server:  you guys are the best looking couple in here tonight, have fun.
46     The server takes Jacks card and leaves, smile on his face. Tony is watch-
47 ing the front door and sips his beer.  Jack checks his 105 function watch for
48 the time and starts on his beer.

52 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (msgs: old, new, improvised, etc.)
53 Deepy Hurt:  Don't be. I'm sure that we'll have plenty of time for rather
54   intimate (rather a strong word, but it'll do) discussions before, during,
55   and after our next visit... Feeling any better?  P.S. Read you mail on 65...
56 alchemist: As I was going to say, I met this funny looking guy (introduced by
57 someone even funnier) and after having strayed to the subject of The INN, he 
58 said something about the fact that someone had been using his border. Trivial,
59 yes, but he doesn't always have access to a terminal so he asked me to let you
60 know how he feel.   By the way, he told me his name was "Mystery Author"...
61 TANYA:   Howzit goin' out there, Lurker? Don't worry about what people may 
62 think of you, it'll all pass in time...   By the way, I liked your story on 
63 CBBS-Aloha, why don't you copy it down and put in here? It's just the type of 
64 thing this place is known for. Once the spys go back under-cover that is...
65 Lady S.: I didn't really mean what I said about the phone number... You sure
66 do carry on some interesting conversations... Alexander the Great, huh?
67 I like the looks of the locker- one thing is missing though,... The PHONE!!!
68 Gaudy Minsky: I hope I spelled that right.   Can you tell me as a fact that 
69   the phone really did exist on your visit? I've called it before, but can't
70   really vouch for it's claimed location. I was told that you knew...

78     "Now if that don't beat all I've ever heard! Someone comes wandering
79 into the Inn, goes back to the Roman Baths, puts on an old costume left
80 for safekeeping, then later starts complaining about someone else being
81 dressed the same as they. Mind you I am speaking from hearsay evidence, not
82 having heard the complaint directly, but only second hand. The person that
83 was speaking about it was the Guardian, although what it is that he guards
84 is still not real clear.(Guarder of borders perhaps---that being the case
85 he should determine more facts of history concerning the matter.) It had
86 come to my attention that the `person of mystery' was possibly associated
87 with Sondargaard, now that suspicion has indeed been confirmed. Perhaps
88 this messenger could pass along that although I had noted the use of the
89 border, which I have used since long before your visible arrival, I deemed
90 that it was due to an unawareness of the historical facts and didn't think
91 it worthy of note. If this 'miffed' person wishes to look different then
92 they will be obliged to find their own unique border. I, on the other hand,
93 I shall continue to use it as I always have."

96   On a sunny tropical beach, the piper was dozing.  For those with the 
97 necessary perception, that which the Egyptians called the "Ka" rose from
98 him as he slept.  Crossing the swirls and intertwining threads of reality,
99 the piper's Ka took form and shape near the footbridge.  A short walk
100 (how strange the sharp sound of immaterial footsteps) and he pressed open
101 the door to the inn.  Inside were the first faint stirrings of an
102 incipient discussion or debate...
103   "Gentlemen," the piper spoke up as the brief exchange slowed for a moment.
104 "I have found that if one speaks with enough authority in his voice, that
105 one usually can incite a "real" expert to reply.  Therefore, taking my
106 courage in hand, the definition of life that I remember from my old colleg
107 classes was somewhat more specific.  I don't know if this is a complete list
108 or not, but it might help.
109   1.  Life is irritable.  Poke it and you get a response.
110   2.  Life eats in some form or another.  It needs an energy source.
111   3.  Life grows.  In some manner it incorporates something from it
112                    environment into itself.
113   4.  Life reproduces.  One or two Lifes get together and make little Lifes.
114                         Rumor has it that in other realities it takes more 
115                         Lifes than this to get together.  Someday they will
116                         Get It All Together.
117 With this the piper began to fade.  (Fumes from the ale are real killers
118 when you're mostly insubstantial.)

133 Piper: All true, except the last one (4) which has started to become
134 modified in some circles since it doesn't fit many lower lifeforms
135 (Not counting the ones on BW.. but then again... <ahem> ) 
136 Viruses and a few others use other life forms to do their reproduction
137 for them, thus eliminating the need for internal reproductive equipment.
138 And of course, one celler's generaly do it via division (hear that Mez?)
139 thus eliminating the need for the second individual. It is interesting
140 that during dificult times, some bacteria have found an interesting way
141 to increase mutation. They inject another bacteria with some of their
142 own DNA thus causing a mix, and hopefully a modification that can survive
143 what ever the curent problem is. This seems to largly be brought on by
144 lack of food thus prventing them to grow and divide as normal.
145 Machines as life forms huh? Someone has been reading Bloom County I see.

148   Mikey:  I thought I had that covered!  (To rephrase, two or ONE 
149 Lifes get together to make little Lifes.  Notice that they may, or may
150 not be the same or different sexes, species, or whatever.)  Actually,
151 I'm a little more worried about the word "little" -- it hardly seems
152 necessary, but sounded cute.  Speaking of cute reproductive habits,
153 check out the honeybee.  Two sexes, but fertilized eggs produce potentially
154 fertile females, unfertilized eggs produce males.  Interesting?

159   I sat down on the sand, at the edge of the water and put my head in my
160 hands. I felt like a ripe mango that had fallen from a tree and landed on a
161 rock. Being with Raza used to make my spirit soar, maybe he's right, maybe I
162 have changed. The way I feel after we're together has certainly changed.
163   Knowing that wallowing in self pity was not a path toward understanding I
164 returned to my vigil, calling to the spirit of the sea. The trade winds were
165 creating patterns that moved across the bay, sparkling in the sunlight. It's
166 the wind spirit dancing life's celebration. Why couldn't I just forget the
167 vision, forget searching for its meaning, forget about finding what I was
168 supposed to do?  Why couldn't I forget about Raza and just enjoy all the
169 beauty around me? At least I knew the answer to that one. No matter how
170 beautiful or exciting an experience it was always richer when shared with
171 someone you love.
172   My thoughts drifted back to the good times we'd shared. The day of the
173 vision had been one of the most wonderful I'd ever known. We'd come out to
174 this very bay to picnic and spend the day together. As the sun neared the
175 horizon we walked down the beach hand in hand, singing one of our favorite
176 songs, sharing the verses, and harmonizing on the chorus.
177   Oh, the island she lie in the sun
178   and life be good for everyone,
179   Greet the morning with the dawn
180   sleep at night when the sun is gone.
181 I could almost hear Raza's deep throated counter point blending in as our
182 voices intertwined with the beat of the surf and the soft sound of the wind
183 in the palms.
184   Harmonize. Harmonize
185   The sun be up, say "it's time to rise"
186   Harmonize. Harmonize.
187   Living in my island paradise.
188 I paused, gave a long sigh, and shook my head to clear the memory from my
189 mind. Remembering alone wasn't half as much fun as remembering together.
190   If I was obliged to rehash the past at least I could try to recall the
191 details of that fateful day.  Yes, it was all too clear. We had decided to
192 climb up to the top of the hill to watch the sunset together before starting
193 home. My heart was so full of joy and love I thought it would burst. Halfway
194 up the hill we came out of the trees, paused to catch our breath and look
195 out at the sea. A huge ship was making it's way toward the island at
196 incredible speed. The wave where the bow split the water was taller than
197 many of the small island trees. It was headed for the deep lagoon on the
198 other side of the island. Raza took one look at it and said, "I'm sorry
199 Magen, I've got to get back to town fast. We'll watch the sunset together
200 some other time." I was so disappointed I couldn't say a word. By the time I
201 regained some of my composure Raza was gone. I trudged on up the hill alone.
202 That was nearly five years ago and we have yet to share that promised sunset
203 together.
204   The sunset that evening was beautiful beyond imagination. As the blazing
205 sun sank below the horizon the sky was suddenly illuminated with the fabled
206 'green flash'. A definite omen of events to come. I settled down quietly in
207 the warm evening breeze and waited for the night to wrap me in its blanket
208 of stars. My own guiding star was one of the first to appear as the light
209 faded rapidly. The sounds of the night creatures began blending with the
210 wind to celebrate the beginning of evening. The tranquility of the fading
211 day gave no hint of the startling events that were soon to follow.
212   Suddenly there was a voice in my head, evaporating the past memories, and
213 startling me out of my musing. Rippling and dancing around in my mind, it
214 was sometimes song and sometimes just harmony. What it said was clear, what
215 it meant ... again the same verse over and over, "`Round and round goes the
216 cycle my friend, If you don't understand walk the path again.'"  When I
217 opened my eyes, which I had closed so I could hear the sound better, I saw
218 the spirit of the sea, for just an instant, silhouetted in the sunset, as
219 she skipped across the waves. In that instant I knew exactly what I must do!

241      It was another beautiful, sunny day. In fact the sun had been shining
242 all year long and the keeper of the stone was in high spirits. Adventure on
243 the sea was in store for the weekend. Attempts by some to dampen others'
244 spirits deserves very little notice. It is apparent that these same people
245 tend to imagine they see traits in others that are in fact their own.

247 for the positive side and you will find it. Look otherwise and you may be
248 obliged to wallow in a sty of your own making. When this happens have the
249 strength of character not to blame others for the perception.

266 Mesolithic, Piper, Mikey, et all, you entries on life are indeed interesting. Piper's old college
267 definition has undergone many changes over the years though. Recent discussions that I was involved
268 in seemed to place much more emphasis on humanistic characteristics rather than biological charac-
269 terisitcs though. My associates and I see broadband definitions that don't take into account 
270 intelligence and self-preservation, even under the guise of survival and instinct. I have heard
271 many to say, 'nihilism is dead.' I guess it is this direction the debate on life seems to be 
272 taking, that is responsible for the current moral outrage of artifical insemination, the challange
273 of in vitro pregnency, and the ever present question of mercy killing. The whole range of
274 subjects span questions of 'where does life begin, and where does it end?' Is abortion legalized
275 murder? When does an fertalized ovum begin to have rights? Some say at conception, while others
276 try to place some deterministic time-line on it. What about the recent advances with sperm-banks
277 and of course, the idea of selective breeding: Let's purify our race by paying the insane and
278 disease ridden not to procreate. When people begin to speak of life, my mind must always swing
279 to subjects of human life, and the directions our species is going. Nothing hits closer to home
280 for me.

310    As iI woke up to go to the station for another hard days of work, I open my
311 dresser drawer, and pull out my small
312 bag of Cocaine, who could resist when itwas free.  I just take the drugs from 
313 the dealer, keep them to myself, and putthem to a good use.  I take the cocaine
314 and spread it over my bowl of cereal as
315 if it was sugar.  I was feeling good already.  I then got dressed, after gettin
316 a good sensation from touching my big
317 whopping nose.  it was a better sensation than of masterbating. i could do this
318 in the public without being embarrased.
319 it was great, then as i reached the climax i comed some snaught, stretching my
320 tongue upwards licking it up.  it was
321 just delicious, just simply by rubbing
322 my nose very softly with a kleenex.

377 Leonard & kathy- I'm here. Writing, too.
378 Papa Smurf- Everytime I see your name I see little blue creatures dancing around singing, "La 
379 la, la, la." Is that the point?
380 the Gaurdian: Okay, I don't like being called a lurker. (Even if I am one). But
381 I'm feeling in a writing mood here. I've been trying to get a hold of this 
382 place for days.

384 alchemist:
385     The man flung around violently to his left. He smiled. And, laughed without
386 happiness. The other man looked at him nerviously, "What, uh, what is your name
387 sir?" The laughing man widened his eyes. The eyes of the insane, laughing man
388 stared wildly at the timed one. "My name?" he laughed again, "Ah ha ha. What is
389 name? They call me Cristo. But, that is nothing but a name. A name, a part of 
390 one's self. A calling of one's self. A name, so gently spoke, is of ourselves.
391 Is my name so important to you? Does it signafy who I am? It is nothing, mean-
392 ingless. The name which is me can not be cast downward. Ha ha ha! I throw the 
393 name away. The name, a part of one's self, a calling of one's self. The name 
394 is a reflection of ourselves." At this point the man discontinued his soliquiy,
395 the other man was gone. Cristo looked at the sky.

398 Out of "curiousity", doesn't Mike Day believe in writing on his own system or
399 does he just have aliases and never go by the name Mike Day?   - Tanya

410 TANYA: CERTAINLY I WRITE HERE. I USE CISTOP MIKEY WHEN TALKING AS MYSELF,
411 AND THE INNKEEPER WHEN RUNNING IN THE FANTASY ROLE. I DON'T USE MIKE DAY
412 BECAUSE IT IS SO... SO... WELL, AH.... NORMAL.
413 TO WONDERER: CERTAINLY PAM WILL SHOW HERE. JUST BE PATIENT, ASK NICLY,
414 AND WITH A LITTLE LUCK YOU MAY SEE A FLEETING GLIMPSE BEFORE SHE RUSHES
415 OFF AGAIN. HMMM PAM? HOW ABOUT IT, YOUR PUBLIC CALLS. HOW ABOUT IF I ADD
416 MY VOICE TO IT? EH?
417 PIPER: IF YOU SAY SO. I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU READ IT, AND I HAVE
418 BECOME SO USE TO THE NORMAL DEFINITION WHICH DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE
419 ASPECT OF EXTERNAL REPRODUCTION THAT I READ THAT INTO WHAT YOU SAID.
420 DEBATOR: ACTUALLY, THE LIFE ASPECT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, IS A NARROW
421 VEIW POINT CURRENTLY BEING ARGUED BY THE ABORTION/ANTI-ABORTION PEOPLE,
422 AND IS NOT REALLY OVERLY APPLICABLE TO THE QUESTION OF LIFE/NON-LIFE
423 IN GENERAL, SINCE THEY ARE DISCUSING WHEN LIKE BEGINS FOR A PARTICULAR
424 SPECIES (US HUMANS) AND NOT IF SOME PARTICULAR THING IS A LIFE FORM OR
425 NOT.
426 FRED ET AL : OK, HAS TO BE ABLE TO REPRODUCE TO BE A LIFE FORM HUH?
427 DOES THAT MAKE SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD THEIR REPRODUCTIVE EQUIPMENT REMOVED
428 NON-LIFE? WHAT ABOUT THOSE SPIECES WHO CAN'T REPRODUCE AT ALL? THOSE
429 THAT ARE CREATED WHOLELY BY MAN. INCLUDING PLANTS AND ANIMALS.

435 This song is dedicated to... (never mind, I'm sure you'll figure it out)
436         Fire In The Sky (words & music: Jordin Kare)
437 Prometheus, they say, brought god's fire down to man,
438 And we caught it, tamed it, trained it since our history began.
439 Now we're going back to heaven just to look him in the eye,
440 And there's a thunder 'cross the land, and a fire in the sky!
441 
442 Gagarin was the first, back in nineteen sixty-one,
443 When like Icarus, undaunted, he climbed to reach the sun.
444 And he knew he might not make it, for it's never hard to die,
445 But he lifted off the pad and rode a fire in the sky.
446 
447 Yet a higher goal was calling, and we vowed to reach it soon,
448 And we gave ourselves a decade to put fire on the moon.
449 And Apollo told the world, "We can do it if we try"
450 For there was one small step, and a fire in the sky.
451 
452 
453 Now two decades since Gagarin, twenty years to the day,
454 We've a shuttle named Columbia to open up the way.
455 Though they say she's just a truck, she's a truck that's aiming high!
456 See the jets burning. See her fire in the sky.
457 
458 Now the rest is up to us. There's a future to be won.
459 We must turn our faces outward. We will do what must be done.
460 For no cradle lasts forever. Every bird must learn to fly,
461 And we're going to the stars. See our fire in the sky.
462 
463 Yes, we're going to the stars. See our fire in the sky!

484 To: TANIS Sysop
485  You really need to work on your software. If I type at any sort of reasonable
486 speed, the characters were lost/garbled. It took me 4 tries to get my name
487 entered. It may be that just the echoed characters are getting garbled, but 
488 that is stil a problem. (I also doubt that this was the case as I could only
489 backspace to the :. If only the echo was garbled I would have would up several
490 spaces farther over due to the "missing" characters.) 
491  I also tend to dislike (on general principles) systems that don't even
492 let you look around until you are validated.

495 Boy, with all the stuff flying in the air about boarders, I'm glad
496 that the BARD is not as picky about the boarder.  I reallize that he
497 had it first, and that he was not on the system regularly when I
498 came on the system and used it.  I call them at work '~~~' my little
499 ti-fighters.  So this is why I chose them.
500 BARD:   Thanks, if you wish me to change it, please feel free to
501   let me know and I will, otherwise we can use them together, use them
502   in peace.
503 
TANYA:  'little blue creatures', I do were a blue jumpsuit when in
504   uniform sometimes at the base, and the kids there said that I look
505   like PaPa Smurf so that is what I got as a nick-name.  I like it
506   a lot better than a few I had in college (harumph)....
507   Actually the name is:     Herr Oberschlumph  (in german)
508 
by the way, these are are line-feeds not blank lines that I am wasting.
509 
NOTE LEFT FOR TANIS SYSOP: I am not the sysop but I do talk with him
510   on occation and will relay the information to him.  He asked me
511   today if I had heard anything about TANIS and I had said NO and
512   then just today I've seen two messages about it.  Maybe I said NO
513   a little to soon.  He is rewritting the I/O stuff tonight since he
514   has home-work all weekend.  After the major school stuff is out of
515   the way, he will put some more time into TANIS.
516 
ALL:  See ya at PorSFiS.

528 Mad Max : In your ear.
529 Mikey: Your point is well taken. I was trying to expand the base of debate to
530 another subject. The question of life/non-life is interesting, but moot. The
531 question of life is important to all, and should not be ignored.

535 ABOUT TANIS:  The board is still being worked on, and the sysop knows there are
536 still a few bugs. He just got a new peice of hardware that will increases the
537 reliability of the input routines. I would just like to say for the record that
538 Tanis has even been compared to the BWMS. as to the B-Board section that is.
539 So call it BWMS Jr. if you like but it is a good system.
540        Thanx,
