25 Mikey: your tax example didn't include a /0, just a 0/  which
26 WILL return 0 on ant system that I ever heard of.
27 
28 Now as for the old 0/0 argument: The mass of a particle at a given
29 velocity is given by Mv = M/tau, where tau = SQR(1-((v^2)/(c^2))).
30 At c tau=0. Now all photons have a REST mass of 0, thus the mass
31 of a photon is 0/0! Note that photons can have ANY mass.

35 Leonard:  I do not dispute your mathematical formulation in the above
36 problem, but I do question your interpretation of an undefined value.
37 An undefined value such as 0/0 does not imply ANY value, only that an
38 exact value cannot be ascertained using that formulation.  Consider
39 the slope of a line in the xy coordinate plane, which may be repre-
40 sented as the difference in y-coordinates divided by the difference in
41 x-coordinates of two distinct points on the lines.  So for a vertical 
42 line, of the form x=constant, the difference in x-coordinates is zero 
43 resulting in a slope of m=something/0, which is undefined.  Does this 
44 mean that m can assume ANY value?  NO, clearly, m<>1,m<>-1,m<>.5,....etc.
45 Given an infinite amount of time, and an infinite amount of patience, 
46 we could find an infinite number of values which m does not equal.  Thus,
47 there are limits to the range of values m can assume but those limits 
48 are mathematically undefined.

67 OPPS! YOUR RIGHT OF COURSE.. MY APPOLIGIES. I SHOULD CHECK MY WORK A LITTLE MORE
68 BEFORE ENTERING IT. (SO HOWCOME NO ONE ELSE CAUGHT IT?)
69 OF COURSE THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE WAS THAT WHEN DEALING WITH NUMBERS
70 IN REGARD TO COUNTING OF OBJECTS. WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COUNT,
71 THEN THE RESULT IS ZERO NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO MANIPULATE THE COUNT
72 OF ZERO. IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU DEAL WITH THE DESCRIPTIVE FORM OF THIS
73 THAT IT TAKES ON OTHER MEANINGS. I EXPECT I'LL GET JUST AS MANY

79 IF THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A VALUE ENTERED IS ZERO AND THAT VALUE  WILL  LATER BE  USED AS A DIVISOR, WOULDN'T IT BE 
80 EASIER TO HAVE YOUR  PROGRAM  CHECK  ALL VALUES TO BE USED  FOR  A ZERO  VALUE, THEN ASSIGN THAT ZERO VARIABLE A NEW
81 VALUE THAT WON'T BE USED FOR THAT AREA  (PERHAPS A -1), THEN  CHECK  AFTER  THE DIVISION FOR NEGATIVE NUMBERS?  OR
82 MERELY CHECK ALL DIVISORS  FOR  A ZERO  VALUE BEFORE DIVISION TAKES PLACE, AND  BRANCH TO A SUBROUTINE THAT WOULD
83 THEN SUBSTITUTE THE DESIRED VALUE  FOR  THAT ITEM (IN THIS CASE, 0).  IS THIS A WORKABLE ARRANGEMENT?

101   YOUR QUESTION I FEEL THAT AFTER A SHORT WHILE HANGING UPSIDE DOWN THE
102   POOR LITTLE TYKES MUST BE COMPLETELY CONSTIPATED. AND IMAGINE THE
103   PANIC WHEN THE FELLAS ON HIGHER PERCHES WAKE UP AND ASSUME THE VERTICAL

121 TO: BATPOOP
122 I TOO AGREE ABOUT THE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE ZERO THING. AS FOR THE ALTERNATE
123 SIDE, THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE IS THAT THE ENGINEERING TYPES RUN INTO A PROBLEM 
124 FROM THEIR STANDPOINT SUCH THAT IF THE RESULT DOES COMEOUT ZERO THEN THEIR 
125 ANSWERS WILL BE INCORRECT. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THIS WHOLE PROBLEM COULD
126 BE SOLVED BY EITHER 1.) FORGET THE WHOLE BLOODY MESS AND LET THE MATHMATICIANS
127 HAVE IT THEIR WAY. 2.) WRITE OUR OWN HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE THAT OPERATES THE WAY
128 WE WOULD LIKE IT TO. 3.) SHOOT THE MATHMATICIANS. 4.) SHOOT THE BUSINESSMEN.
129 5.) SHOOT THE PROGRAMERS. OR 6.)CONTINUE TO SHOOT THE BULL....
130 AS FOR 80 COL.. SIGH.. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO
131 THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWED THAT (NOT THAT I WOULD PATCH
132 IN THE 3K OF CODE AGAIN THAT MAKES BWMS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL. I
133 CREATED BWMS BY REFERING TO A SIMILAR SOURCE AND DISASSEMBLING WHAT I HAD
134 AND THEN PATCHING WHAT I WANTED. I AM NOT EVEN SURE THE 78 COL SOURCE WOULD
135 RUN ON THIS PARTICULAR MACHINE. ANYWAY, EVEN GIVEN THAT, THE SOURCE IS BURNED
136 INTO 2708 EPROMS, AND I HVE NO WAY TO BURN THEM ANYMORE. AS FOR THE WAY DATA
137 IS STORED, IT IS STORED AS ONE LINE PER SECTOR ON THE DISK. WHICH IS A HARDWARE
138 LIMITATION. THERE IS NO OPERATING SYSTEM. WHAT YOU SEE 'IS' THE OPERATING
139 SYSTEM! RAM SIZE IS 1K EPROM SIZE IS 8K DISK SIZE IS 18 SECTORS PER TRACK BY
140 35 TRACKS WITH THE FIRST SECTOR RESERVED FOR THE SYSTEM (MARGIN INFO, LAST LINE,
141 ECT.) I DID NOT WRITE THE MAIN LINE CODE AND I TAKE NO CREDIT (OR DISCREDIT)
142 FOR IT. I AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO CHANGE THINGS, BUT I AM LOATH TO
143 FOR BOTH THE ABOVE STATED REASONS, AND THE FACT THAT BWMS IS ONE OF THE MOST
144 RELIABLE COMPUTERS I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO MUCK WITH THAT.
145 IF EVERYONE USES 80 COL MESSAGES, THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS THAT THE DISKS 
146 WILL BE CHANGED FASTER. AS FOR ME, I ARCHIVE THEM IN CPM FORMAT SO IT 
147 DOESN'T MATTER SINCE THE DISKS ARE RECYCLED AFTER BEING ARCHIVED.

153 ================================================
154 	Besides the well-known /0, there are plenty of other mathematical functions
155 that can have illegal input.  Trying to take the log of 0 or a negative number,
156 the arcsin or arccos of a number greater than 1, and some others.  Most of us
157 don't deal in these things, so they aren't mentioned.  But I think that we have
158 to provide for illegal operations.
159 	For simple programs that input data, do only a little manipulation, and
160 then output the result, a no-error return of /0 might be visible and correctible.
161 But many programs take data from files, do extensive modifications, then output
162 the data to other files.  Maybe never even seen by human eyes.  In that case,
163 allowing an illegal operation could result in the contamination of large amounts
164 of data, possibly quite important.  And even if you suspected an error, you
165 would have no clue where it happened.
166 	A program is called 'robust' if it can be fed all sorts of nonsense 
167 data, and operate properly on it.  The consists of error checking and traps
168 to make sure that if Garbage gets in, much less Garbage gets out.  Programs
169 needn't be robust if they are written by an individual for himself, since
170 he can control the data they are run on.

173 D.O.M: Reguarding your example of the slope of a vertical segment,
174 That is not an example of 0,0 because slope is defined as dy/dx.
175 
176 While there is a zero in the denominator, the value for dy is non-
177 zero for a segment or a line.  So, you end up with a situation like:
178 5/0, 11/0, inf/0 (in the case of a vertical line), etc.  These all
179 fall under the set of UNREAL numbers.  The only example of 0/0 is
180 when dy=0 and dx=0 (ergo, a point) and a point can have any slope 
181 you want to assign to it.  
182 
183 Alas, the time has come to leave your fair Inn.  I must now venture forth into
184 the world of acadamia.  To all of you, my thanks.  To Aaron, Tron, Pam, 
185 Charlotte, Batpoop, Master, Leonard, and even to (un)signed, and any one else,
186 I will miss your discussions.  But my special thanks goes to Mikey and his
187 GREAT!!! system.  To all, farewell.

190 about 0/0=R and the UNREAL numbers, hurry.

192 FAREWELL                                                           THE DOCTOR

196 Doctor:  I was speaking, of course, in terms of conventional mathematics
197 (which everyone with the exception of yourself uses) by which any REAL num-
198 ber (zero or otherwise) divided by zero is undefined.  Had I any desire
199 to take into consideration your "UNREALs", I would have no basis for doing
200 so, as you have made no attempt to define the operations which are legal
201 and closed in this group, nor the properties which govern them.  By
202 "academia" I presume you are speaking of your first year of college.  Per-
203 haps there you will have the opportunity to learn the basics of math-
204 ematics, if you concentrate your efforts on doing so, rathar than cor-
205 recting your instructors.  I sincerely hope, Doctor, that you never get
206 your hands on a scalpel, but if you do, please employ it practicing surgery
207 on yourself, beginning preferably with fingerectomies (I suspect your ins-
208 structors will also recommend a toungue-ectomy).  Perhaps I speak
209 to harshly, but I suspect that if your patience will endure a year at
210 Miscellaneous U, you will then begin to recognize your limitations, and
211 only then will you begin to learn.
212                 GOOD LUCK!

226 As to checking for illegal entries & correcting or rejecting them, even this
227 is not always enough: no entry at all may cause trouble. A good example of
228 this failed one of our Venus rockets. Seems that the FORTRAN compiler the
229 program was tested on set variables to zero until used, but the compiler 
230 used on the real thing didn't, leaving garblagage. The rocket crashed.
231 Nothing in, garbage out.
232 
233 If the subject of ethics were to be brought up again, would everybody just
234 guano, or?? In particular, in the last 2 issues of Scientific American is
235 an article on cooperation vs defection (no, not defecation) If we all work
236 together we gain, but sometimes it benefits the individual who cheats more
237 than the cooperaters, and indeed a few defectors can destroy the whole thing
238 There are things that can be enjoyed by a few, but if all tried, itcould
239 not be enjoyed. A pie can only be sliced so thin. If the choice is logical,
240 all who choose logically will get the same answer, and so your own choice
241 is a valid example of everyones; this leads to being able to predict the
242 "best choice for all", it's the same as your own.
243 We will give one million dollars divided (not by zero, i hope) by the total
244 of all numbers entered, to the person who enters the highest number.
245 Unfortunately the numbers entered included things like 10^100, called
246 a googol, and 10^googol, called googolplex, and several like sums: the 
247 winner would receive something so near zero the number can't even be written
248 what woulLd you try??

334 CS classes.  I believe that PSU also did for some classes until recently.
335 Anyway, thanks for the above info.  I am delighted that my original three
336 assumptions, premature as they may have been, were correct.
337 As to the two ongoing discussion of /0, one regarding mathematical theory
338 and the other regarding computer applications, I would like to address my-
339 self to the latter, as I am still awaiting a response on the former.
340 If I understand correctly what you (PAM) were suggesting, it would work,
341 and would probably be preferable to returning zero in most cases (with
342 the possible exception of business applications such as those previously
343 discussed [one must exercise extreme caution in what one says on this
344 system]), and in some cases even preferable to returning MAXINT.
345 There are some inherent problems, though.  Although it has been a long,
346 long time (punched-card days) since I have used ForTran, I seem to recall
347 that it supports complex numbers.  I am not aware of any basic interpretors
348 or compilers that do so, however.  So, creatures such as SQR(-1) and
349 Undefined must be represented in memory as a string if they are to have
350 their own symbol.  So the bulk of the data must also be in string format.
351 IN GENERAL (I stress these former words) numerical data is represented
352 in floating point format, so each number requires two bytes of memory,
353 one for the mantissa and one for the power of ten (simplified).  In string
354 format though, a byte is required for
355 each character.  So 132.56, for example, would require two bytes if
356 treated as a number and six bytes if treated as a string.  Where division
357 is involved, you  will almost inevitably have greater than two digits
358 to deal with, so the memory requirements would be much greater.
359 Also this data would have to be converted to numerical format in order
360 to perform any computations and prior to this it would have to be checked
361 for the non-convertable values SQR(-1)
362 and Undefined in order to prevent errors.  All this manipulation would
363 take the computer about as much time as all this typing has taken me.
364 Pardon my lack of brevity.

384 Pam, using a special character like italic i for sqr(-1) is very dificult,
385 as most computers have no such character. In general (where have I heard
386 this before) the business computers have very simple graphics or none at
387 all since it wasn't considered useful. The home computers are more closely
388 related to video games, and are more modern, so they may have fairly good
389 graphics, but in contrast fall down in such things as memory or disc size.
390 This is changing rapidly, soon just abut anything will have graphics. Your
391 simple machine is likely more advanced than you think.
392 I still haven't seen any use for /0 , all comments have either been math
393 errors, or involved checking for 0, not dividing by it.
394 Dom, you asked about bat caves, and how bats excrete, soo If you are truly
395 dirty, you should love bat cave, they are the most disgusting things on 
396 earth. Bats have the most parasites of any known species. Of course the
397 best (worst) caves harbor vampires, as GIGO , or as here liquid in, liquid..
398 you will never forget the smell, no matter how hard you try. I cannot
399 believe anyone who had seen and smelled guano would call himself after it.
400 
401 Last night I noted the question of cooperating or defecting, and said it
402 was an issue of ethics. Since noone answered I will say we must stop all
403 defectors before they hurt us. We call defectors criminals, but in the USA
404 we have this funny idea about prior restraint, and punish crimes only after
405 they are committed. This is wrong: by the time we get around to punishing
406 someone for a crime, the law has already failed: the crime has been done.
407 Putting them ih jail afterwards only lets them learn from the older criminal

426 BAD, MAYBE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU  ARE ASKING FOR.  IF PUTTING

429 CRIMES WOULD BE BETTER?  HOW WILL WE BE SURE SOMEONE IS GOING TO COMMIT A
430 CRIME?  I SAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ROB A BANK IN 2 WEEKS, SO LET'S PUT YOU

435 I see what he's saying.  The answer is very simple.  First, you make a tachyonic
436 memory device (TMD) which gives you a negative 100 nsec access time.  Then
437 store and retrieve information on criminal behavior 1,000,000,000,000 times,
438 so you can predict a day ahead of time who will commit what crime.  Lock him
439 up the appropriate period of time, and you're saved.

472 ***************************************************************
473 In recent years there has been a good deal of controversy regarding which
474 colour CRT ultimately produces the least eye strain on the operator.
475 At present, the display of 'light characters on a dark background'
476 predominates over 'dark characters on a light background'. However the
477 German standards suggest that dark on light is a better adaptation to
478 human capabilities and to the working environment, and strongly suggests
479 this for future CRT selections based on the following assumptions:
480 1. Unavoidable reflections are found to be less disturbing with dark
481 cahracters on a light background.
482 2. Less fatigue results from better match between luminescent levels of 
483 document and screen.
484 3. The closer the luminescence of the screen is to the illumination required
485 for general office work, the lower the resulting eye strain naturally
486 caused between adaptation in looking from light to dark or dark to light.
487 4. Recognition of dark characters on a light background.
488 
489 As a guideline, when displaying light characters on a dark background, the
490 contrast should range between 3 to 1 and 15 to 1. When displaying dark
491 characters on a light background, the luminescent level of the background
492 must be at least three times that of the characters. In any case, contrast
493 levels should be adjustable.

496 Congratulations, MIKEY: You have redeemed your tax-calculation error b submitting the ergonomic tips above.  People,
497 does this suggest to you that the operator, having chosen the contrast setting, is thus the prime cause of his own
498 eyestrain?  Gee, maybe this reinforces the notion that we, must face the consequences for our own acts, however trivial,
499 shunning the popular notion (espoused by schools, governments, unions, media, and societal lazies) that "whatever
500 disturbs me is someone else's fault, and 'They' better make it right" (whoever 'They' is)!

544 How about an opportunity for employment?
545 If you missed the ad in a recent Oregonian...
546 PGE is looking for a Communications Engineer to work in the Telecommunications
547 Department.  We are looking for an all around sort of person with a background
548 in Electronic Engineering (and professional registration... or the capability
549 to be registered).  Some experience in analog/digital design would be nice,
550 although this is not a major part of the job.
551 
552 The primary responsibilities would be in systems level configuration of
553 telephone, data transmission, telemetry, mobile radio, and microwave 
554 equipment.  If you lke working on one thing for a month at a time, forget it.
555 Versatility is all-important!!  
556 Familiarity with computers and power system technology would be great.  An
557 FCC Second Class License (or the current equivalent) is a plus.
558 
559 The working environment is mostly casual, but the ability to provide
560 services to other departments on a professional level is mandatory.
561 Compensation is very fair, and depends on experience.
562 Non-smoker definitely prefered!!!!!!

603 Mike, before you glorify the German standards on computers too much, consider
604 their placement of the all important return key: small and out of the way.
605 Dark letters on a lite background may be better in a brightly lit office, but
606 when I tried it here, it blew me away. I don't have enough control on the
607 contrast. The choice of lite on dark also has one other advantage: it is much
608 easier on the hardware. I like white, it seems many like green, but 
609 beer bottle brown is very German. Any votes for red or violet?
610 As to preventive justice being totalitarian, does the current ratio of blacks

614 value is jailing him to the one he shot? There are far more honest people here
