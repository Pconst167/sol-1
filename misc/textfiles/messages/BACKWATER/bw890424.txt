 90 EFFORTS POINTLESS, LUJAN SAYS:-4/26/89
 91     Efforts to hose down coastal Alaskan beaches fouled by the Exxon Valdez 
 92 tanker spill are ineffective public relations gestures that make little 
 93 relevant contribution to the massive cleanup effort, Interior Secretary Manuel 
 94 Lujan said. "It just seemed like make-work for appearances' sake," Lujan said 
 95 after returning from a three-day visit to the scene.
 96     In an interview with USA TODAY, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said the 
 97 state of Alaska has to accept some of the blame for the ineffectual early 
 98 cleanup efforts in the Exxon oil spill. In the hours immediately after the 
 99 tanker went aground, various cleanup proposals were advanced but effectively 
100 vetoed by Alaskan officials, Lujan said.
101     For all the environmental damage caused by the Exxon oil spill, Interior 
102 Secretary Manual Lujan said he continues to believe oil exploration should be 
103 permitted in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Alaska's northern coast. 
104 Lujan said he regards the nation's oil need as compelling reason to risk 
105 environmental damage on the Arctic plain.
106     USA TODAY columnist Dan Dorfman is reporting advice to Exxon Corp. 
107 stockholders: Get out now while the getting's good. Reason: Exxon could be 
108 dead money for the next two to three years because of the impact of its giant 
109 oil spill off the Alaskan coast.
110     USA TODAY columnist Dan Dorfman quotes Alan Gaines, a partner in a 
111 brokerage firm specializing in energy research, on bad tidings for Exxon Corp. 
112 stock. Gaines: Exxon has about $400 million worth of insurance to cover oil 
113 spills. But he figures total costs covering the Alaskan disaster will run 
114 between $5 billion and $8 billion.
115     The implications from the Alaskan oil spill for Exxon Corp. are ominous, 
116 energy analyst Alan Gaines told USA TODAY columnist Dan Dorfman. Gaines sees 
117 costs of $5 billion to $8 billion connected to spill. He says that Exxon - 
118 already facing lawsuits - has yet to set aside reserves to cover the costs. 
119 Gaines predicts Exxon will scrap its dividend boosts after seven consecutive 
120 years of raises.
121     Energy analyst Alan Gaines told USA TODAY columnist Dan Dorfman that he 
122 expects Exxon Corp.'s share repurchase plan to be sharply curtailed as a 
123 result of the Alaskan oil spill. The buyback had helped fatten Exxon's stock 
124 price and boost per-share earnings. Also: Gaines sees possibility some large, 
125 socially conscious institutional investors might unload extensive Exxon 
126 holdings.
127     Exxon Corp. rejects the conclusions drawn by energy analyst Alan Gaines, 
128 reported by USA TODAY columnist Dan Dorfman. It says his $5 billion to $8 
129 billion estimate for the Alaskan oil spill is ridiculous. Exxon spokesman: 
130 There is nothing definitive about a dividend boost or a per-share buyback on a 
131 year-to-year basis. Gaines' assumptions are invalid.
132                                                                              
133 TOPIC - CLEANING UP ALASKA:
134     Manuel Lujan Jr., secretary of the interior, talks with USA TODAY's 
135 editorial board and Gannett News Service about the Alaskan oil spill. Alaska's 
136 Gov. Steve Cowper adds his views.
137  WHAT'S THE SITUATION IN ALASKA? IS THE OIL SPREADING?
138     LUJAN: No, most of it has disappeared. It's either on the beaches or in 
139 the fiords. You only see ribbons of oil, six to 10 feet wide. And some of them 
140 are long - 100 or 200 yards. But it's really solid stuff. Soft peanut butter 
141 is what it's like.
142  WHAT WILL CLEAN THAT UP?
143     LUJAN: The fishermen are the most effective way. They're going out there 
144 with scoops or buckets, filling them up, bringing them back to shore and 
145 selling them to Exxon for $5 a bucket.
146  WHY WAIT FOR PEOPLE WITH BUCKETS? WASN'T ANYONE IN CHARGE?
147     LUJAN: The Coast Guard was in charge, very clearly. But when they started 
148 doing the things that they were supposed to do, the state of Alaska objected 
149 to it. The Coast Guard tried some burning; Alaska objected. They tried 
150 chemical dispersants; Alaska objected. The Coast Guard, which is the federal 
151 cleanup agent, just didn't know what to do.
152  DOES THAT MEAN EXXON'S GETTING TOO MUCH BLAME?
153     LUJAN: Well, they're the ones that wrecked the ship. They've got the 
154 ultimate responsibility. But I think they are all to blame. In the 
155 containment, Alaska has to share the blame. And then the Coast Guard for 
156 letting Alaska intimidate them.
157  SO HOW IS THIS EVER GOING TO GET CLEANED UP?
158     LUJAN: Man's efforts are not going to pick it up. Eventually, there will 
159 be a good-sized storm, and that will break it up.
160  WHAT MIGHT HAVE LESSENED THE DISASTER?
161     LUJAN: More equipment; a different kind of equipment. The king of 
162 equipment that we have is not sufficient to handle that kind of a spill. First 
163 of all, you have the ship for skimming that can pump form 200 to 500 barrels 
164 an hour. But its capacity is only 37 barrels. The second thing is the booms 
165 that they have there were like Tinkertoys. They were breaking up.
166  WHAT ABOUT CHARGES ABOUT DISPERSANTS NOT BEING ALLOWED?
167     COWPER: Chemicals to break up the oil didn't work when first tested by the 
168 Coast Guard the day of the Exxon Valdez accident because the weather was too 
169 calm. When conditions improved, the industry didn't have enough of the 
170 dispersant.
171

292 A question:  (actually, a story and then a question)
293     The other day in a writing class, we were giving comments on an anonymous
294 essay.  Instead of saying, "the author says, the author does, the author..."
295 all the time, I resorted to the neutral pronoun 'he,' thinking it the most
296 logical and best-sounding way to express my thoughts.  The instructor took 
297 it to be sex-biased, possibly sexist.  The question:  how many people out 
298 there are actually offended by the use of 'he' as a neutral pronoun for 
299 people.  Anybody know a better word?  ('it' sounds a bit derogatory, no?
300 'he or she' can do for once or twice in a paragraph, but is worse than
301 'the author' in the long run)

308 I think 'they' is a good alternative. Or, just use she. I've seen some writters
309 do that. Seems sort of strange at first, but what the hell. Women have had to
310 put up with it, why should I complain?
311  
312 I was dodling and the following is what I came up with, it is the opening
313 scene to The second part of Patricks story. (Oh, swob. I use AZComm on its
314 lowest text send speed. Just hit the 'Help' key and you'll see what I mean.)
315  
316      A shadowy figure moved rapidly from stall to stall. Few noticed, and 
317 those that did smiled knowingly. The screaching of the SeaGulls that 
318 seamed to be everywhere was a constant reminder that the sea was near.
319 One stall in particuler seemed to have drawn our furtive friend. As if out
320 of nowhere he appeared in front of the propriator. "Brian sends his regards."
321      The man was dressed in the simple yet functional dress that many of the
322 Merchents seemed to prefer. "And?"
323      "He has a request."
324      "What will it be this time?"
325      "Leaf of Cerium, no less then ten. Can you get it?"
326      "I might, it will be expensive though."
327      A hand came from under the dark robes and placed a money pouch down on 
328 the counter. "Will this be enough?"
329      The merchent picked up the pouch and after examining its contents nodded 
330 in agrement. "Three weeks, no less."
331      "I"ll be back in two."
332      Their was an uncomfortable silence. Finaly the Merchant conceded. "Two
333 it is."
334      "Good day then." And like the wind he was gone.
335      The alley he stood in was silent and deserted, the perfect place for
336 a quick spell. He pulled a tiny vial from inside his cloak and after a
337 moment of concentration through it on the ground. A billowing cloud of
338 smoke enveloped him, and when it cleared he was gone.
339      Back in his room Jos removed his cloak and emptied his pockets. He had 
340 done well, perhaps 10 gens if he disposed of everthing properly. And their
341 was the bonus from Brian. A quit chime reminded him that it was time for 
342 dinner. If he didn"t get there soon the best places would be taken. 
343      The dark cloak and the furtivness were now gone and a young man, 
344 perhaps 17 was revealed. There was nothing outstanding about him,
345 and during his walk nobody gave him a second glance. 
346

348 Thats all for now.

384 GROUP SAYS REPORTS INCORRECT:-4/28/89
385     Reports from Alaska have failed to get across the vast killing of wildlife 
386 or the enormous remaining risks to birds, animals and fish from the oil spill 
387 in Prince William Sound, a conservation group said Thursday. The Defenders of 
388 Wildlife said reports of 200 to 300 miles of beach contaminated by the 11 
389 million-gallon spill were inaccurate. Actual contamination: 1,000-2,000 miles.
390                                                                            
391 EXXON CONTRIBUTES TO ALASKA:-4/28/89
392     Exxon will give the Alaska Tourism Marketing Council and the Alaska 
393 Visitor Association an estimated $10 million for a four-month print and TV 
394 advertising and public relations campaign, reports Advertising Age. The 
395 effort, breaking May 1, will use TV spots from the council's current campaign.
396 EXXON CREATES LITIGATION PANEL:-4/28/89
397     The board of directors of the Exxon Corp. has created an independent 
398 litigation committee to determine whether Exxon should file lawsuits against 
399 any one or more of present or former employees or directors because of the 
400 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Committee: Jess Hay, Sir Hector Laing and Philip E. 
401 Lippincott. They are all non-employee directors of Exxon.
402 SURVEY - PROFITABILITY DOWN:-4/28/89
403     A survey by the American Petroleum Institute finds that despite increased 
404 net income, the profitability of the leading U.S. oil companies lags behind 
405 that of non-oil firms. API: Gain in income from refining and marketing 
406 operations offset by decline in exploration and production earnings.

444 To those following the cold-fusion experiments:  The Friday 28 edition
445 of the Vanguard, PSU's school paper, has a front-page story about an
446 experiment on campus headed by Physics professor John Dash.  25 ml of heavy
447 water, platinum and palladium conductors, 2 watts of electrical power, and
448 a special electrolyte not used in the original Pons-F experiment produced
449 100 times the input energy.  It lasted 10 seconds (the duration of the
450 current flow) and heated the water 6.5 degrees C in that time.  No mention
451 of radiation is made, but the reported neutrons in other experiments are
452 difficult to detect.  Now, all I want to know is, where can I buy
453 palladium stock?

471  
472 On May 12th around 10PM J.D.'s Place will be going down permanently.
473  
474 This is because I will be moving from Portland to Eugene during that
475 weekend. This is for personal reasons which are long and complex which I do
476 not wish to go into here.
477  
478 I apologize for the apparent suddeness of this decision, and for any
479 problems it might cause. The time I have spent running this system has been
480 a lot of fun, and I have met many great people. I will miss you all.
481  
482 I do not know yet if I will be setting up my system in Eugene yet. I would
483 like to, but other considerations must be attended to first. At the very
484 least it will be late summer or fall before J.D.'s Place again sees the
485 light of day, and maybe in a vastly altered form. When (if) this happens I
486 will be calling the Blue Parrot (661-3529) and Applephilia (591-8090) with
487 the information in case anyone would like to call long distance.
488  
489 I would like it if somebody organized a Farewell To J.D.'s Place party. I
490 most certainly will not have the time to do so between now and the weekend
491 of the 13th. An optimum time would be the weekend of the 20th or the 27th.
492 Gino's comes to mind as a meeting place (it's traditional!) but that, too,
493 I will leave in the hands of whoever cares to organize it.
494  
495 Finally, I would like to thank you great people for calling and
496 contributing to make this one of the finest systems Portland has ever seen.
497 I can only hope I will be able to do this well in Eugene. Thank you one and
498 all.

544         Sem punched in, allowing the crisp edges of C-space to fill
545 his awareness.  The grid lines pulsed brightly, carrying thousands
546 of transactions per second.  Sem ignored them.  He was after bigger
547 game.
548         Sem's fingers flew over his keyboard, and he moved.  He moved
549 faster than fast-forward, his sensory input distorting for a moment.
550 He knew no one else in the matrix could move as fast.  Speed aided the
551 ability to attack, and also made retreats possible.  More slowly now,
552 he moved his matrix-analogue nearer his target.  He dared go no closer,
553 or the ICE systems would lock on to him too soon.
554         Streched before him, some two clicks farther down the 5F7B:A8 line,
555 stood the Turing pyramid.  The Turings were cyber-police, the watchdogs
556 of AI machines.  Only so far would they allow machines to evolve, and no
557 farther.  Every AI used an ANN (analog-neural-net) cube to provide the
558 base for intelligence.  Turing registered every ANN and watched it.
559 Sem intended to make Turing forget about one.
560         Sem jacked out for a moment and reached for his cartridge.  It
561 had taken weeks to construct it, taking the CPU time from over a
562 dozen systems to run the silicon-compiler.  It was his program, but as
563 software it was too slow-- useless.  Once translated into hardware
564 it was a weapon.  He called it DiamondCutter.
565         Sem jacked back in, casually slotting DiamondCutter.  Instantly,
566 the form of a ship materialized about his matrix-analogue, the heads-up
567 display targeting the Turing pyramid automatically.  Several displays
568 winked on, controls formed out of nothing beneath his mental hands.
569 Sem checked the information, noting green lights over each display.
570         Easy.  He knew it would be easy.  Turing didn't have a chance.

575 Lurking mostly. 
576  Impromptu story follows. 
577  
578      The wizard in the window.
579  
580      The wizard in the window stared at me as if with its eyes it could know
581 all that transpired within my mind. Its clay hand held above its head an orb,
582 in which I could see a tiny round replica of my face reflected. I fixated on 
583 that for a moment, imagining myself as actually being that size. I'd probably 
584 see eye to eye with the tiny statue. 
585  
586      I looked down at the price tag, 35$. It was a heck of a lot of money for
587 a lump of clay and a tiny bit of crystal... Why not? And so I walked in and
588 bought it. The sales lady was a bit uptight, as I insisted that I had to have
589 the one in the window. I offered an extra 5 for her trouble and she decided tha
590 t perhaps it was worth her time. It was wrapped and bagged and I was out of the
591 store. Total transaction time, 5 minutes. 
592  
593      I looked around at the other shops in the small mall, but saw nothing 
594 interesting. Time to find the car and drive home. I knew just the spot for
595 my new purchase... I nearly hit the neighbors cat coming into the drivway,
596 Boris was its name, but the way it always seemed to be nearly underwheel made
597 me think that chicken was more appropriate. Stop the car, pull out the stereo
598 and lock the door. Ah, the joys of modern living.
599  
600      I noticed that the grass was dying, I'd have to look at the sprinkler 
601 controls again, They don't even make the things they didn't used to make the
602 way they used to make them. Up the stairs and to the door. Insert key, yea the
603 same old routine. Flipping the light switch by the door brought my living room
604 to elumination, and also served to remind me that it was time to vacume again,
605 but my new purchase was heavy under my arm. I'd always thought the mantle of
606 the fire place looked a little bare, so after unwraping my purchase I filled 
607 that naging hole.

667 (More impromptu story telling follows.)
668  
669     After dinner I sat down to read the paper. Death, violence and 
670 advertisments all lept out at me. Somtimes it just seems better to avoid
671 finding out what the rest of the world is doing. After flipping through the
672 22 chanels I have the dubious houner of recieving I decided it was time to do
673 some reading. Somthing light and entertaining I thought. I looked at my to
674 be read shelf and spoted a book by Piers Anthony that I had been wanting to 
675 read. Another of his Xanth series. Always good fodder for an evenings 
676 entertainment.
677  
678      Some two hours later I had made my way through most of the book. It was
679 a familer story, but as usual t execution was superb. I caught a movement out
680 of the corner of my eye. I looked over at the fireplace, looked away and then 
681 looked back again. The clay mage was dancing. twirling about and tosing his
682 crystal ball into the air. This went on for several minutes while I sat there
683 slack jawed. Then with a final florish he turned to me, smiled and disapered.
684  
685      The next day I went back to the little shop in the mall. And there in the
686 window was the clay mage. I wasn't sure if it was the same one untill it 
687 winked at me.

777 Science Con Fusion by Robert Fried
778      Science is in trouble.  Big trouble.  And it's all because of a couple of 
779 scientists in Utah who simply refuse to follow the rules.  They believe that 
780 they have created atomic fusion in a jar, and a few other researchers now 
781 think they're right.  If they are, we may have a curcu of very cheap energy, 
782 but science as we know it may be done for.
783      How have these people endangered science?  To put it bluntly, they may 
784 have started a movement toward science on the cheap.  No more multi-million 
785 dollar physics0labs, no more huge government grants to look into the long term 
786 effects of exposure to neutrinos, no more super colliders. Scientific research 
787 may be moving into a jar.  Future requests for large grants may see 
788 foundations questioni~g whether a few hundred dollars for some heavy water and 
789 a few palladium rods might not be enough.  No?  Well then, how about trying 
790 some other kind of rod?  Have you looked into the possibility of using rhodium 
791 rods?  Why not? 
792      If dhese upstarts had any consideration at all for their colleagues, they 
793 would have hidden their jar in a mass of stainless steel and surrounded it 
794 with rooms full of sophisticated electronics.  That's the least they could 
795 have done.
'96  0   Yes, it's possible that it may all blow over, even if we do end up with 
797 an almost limitless source of energy for twenty bucks.  Maybe the government 
798 and foundations will treat the whole thing as an exception to the rule, and 
799 maybe0they'll go on investing their millions in research. Maybe.
800      But don't count on it.
801      At this very moment, there may be scientists waiting in the wings with 
802 other shoestring discoveries, biding their time until the furor over fusion0
80# disappears.  As you read this, there may be thousands of disgruntled graduate 
804 students in their labs trying dumb experiments with foam hamburger boxes, 
805 orange crates, mailing tubes, and water guns, hoping against hope that they 
806 will come up with antigravity, perpetual motion, time travel, teleportation, 
807 or a cure for cancer.
808      Hamburger boxes?  Yes, hamburger boxes.  You know, those foam boxes that 
809 are hinged on one edge.  Some smart kid may decide to take a closer lok at 
810 the orange residue left in the box weeks after the removal of his 
811 cheeseburger.  His nimble mind might wonder why the leftover cheese has 
812 apparently not been attacked by mold. Look out cancer, here it comes -- the 
813 Big Mac Effect.
814      Oh yes, it would be very nice if a graduate student happened on the Big Ma
815 breakthrough, but after cheap fusion, a 99-cent cancer cure would totally
816 destroy the scientific establishment. 
817      Silly?  Yes, indeed.  As silly as a jar full of water and a couple of 
818 metal rods.

820  This is Number 174 in a series of articles designed to explain the world to

823  Watch It by Robert Fried                         
824      Cows like to watch television.  In a study several years ago, cows were
825 shown to produce more milk when they had television available in the barn, so
826 the conclesion0was that they enjoyed it.
827      Aside from the question of why the researchers decided to set up a TV in 
828 the barn, there is nothing at all interesting in the project.  After all, 
829 people enjoy watching television too.  It should be more0inturesting that 
830 people watch television, b ecause under close questioning, even cows will 
831 admit that they are stupid animals.  Humans don't like to admit that they are 
832 stupid. In fact, they will go to great lengths to avoid looking stupid.  Hmm.  
833 On reflection, perhaps someone caught a few humans watching TV in the barn, 
834 and perhaps they decided to explain their behavior by claiming to be 
835 performing research, and perhaps other people believed them.  Yes, that's 
836 pocsible.
837      The fact is that people will watch almost anything. The most significant 
838 difference between the Gilligan's Island of yesterday and the Alf of today is 
839 that Gilligan was more intelligent.  But it shouldn't be surprising that 
840 people watch those shows when one considers that they have been enraptured for 
841 years by the spectacle of Mr. and Mrs. America buying deodorant on The Price 
842 Is Right.
843      Television is, to be sure, a special case.  It is, after all, an oasis of 
844 brightness in an otherwise drab and lifeless room.  No matter how frayed the 
845 curtains become or how much dust builds up on the coffee table, the screen 
846 radiates excitement.
847      Some people can't take the excitement, of coubse.  But that doesn't mean 
848 that they are immune.  The literature has reported cases of people who watch 
849 fish.  These poor souls buy huge tanks, fill them with water, rocks, and fi 
850 sh, then sit and stare for hours.  One might imagine that watching a little 
851 yellow fish swim back and forth for a few minutes would be enough for anyone, 
852 but one would be wrong.
853      You wouldn't have been surprised to learn that human beings can spend 
854 their time watching guppies if you knuw arout the pancakes.
855      Pancakes.  You know, those spongy things that you brown on a griddle, 
856 then have to drown in corn syrup before they will slide down your throat.  
857 Right, those pancakes. At the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, special `olice had to 
858 be hired to keep the crowds of people from crushing each other while trying to 
859 watch a lady make pancakes.  The Betty Crocker Company has a photograph of a 
860 crowd watching a short-order cook making pancakes eleven years earliub than 
861 that. Come to think of it, how surprising is it that people would watch 
862 someone make pancakes when you find out that someone else spent their time 
863 watching the people who were watching?
864      Human beings will watch pancakes browning, fish swimming, pizza dough 
865 stretching, balloons rising, snow falling, baseball, ant farms, The Price Is 
866 Right, and cows. If we can tear our eyes away for a few moments, we might want 
867 to re-evaluate the comparative intelligence of sows0and people.
868      No, maybe not.

932 Gee, Even mine? :-). Yes folks, the lurk ratio is heading down. But remember,
933 only yoe can keep this trend going. 
934  
935      Another attempt at impromptu story telling follows.
936  
937      It was one of those warm summer days that writers seem so fond of writting
938 about. I sat in the living room watching TV. Fred and thu ga~g were doing 
939 their thing. Suddenly by brother burst in through the front door. He looked 
940 a little wild eyed, and right away I knew somthing was wrong. Being the oldest
941 I knew I'd better try to get a handle on the situation. He ran back into the
942 kitchen, I followed.
943  
944      "Whats wrong?"
945      "The Clubhouse, it's on fire! Grab some milk jugs and fill them with 
946 water!" 
947  
948      I didn't have time for questions, the 'clubhouse' was a big hole in an 
949 open field covered with boards. Surronding those boards was dry grass, and 
950 beyond that, on two sides was the begining of a duplex. We filled a couple of
951 water jugs each and ran out the door and up the road. I Don't think I had 
952 ever ran that fast before, the thought of eight or nine house going up in 
953 smoke really scared me.
954  
955      By the time we got there the flames were leaping up six or seven feet.
956 we emptied the jugs out, but it didn't seem to do much good. A couple f 
957 my brothers friends were there as well. We started to throw dirt down into the
958 pit and did our best to keep the flames down.
959  
960      More story telling later.
961  
962      Vision, I'm feeling sort of indiferent right now. I'm goi~g hme this
963 weedend to help my mom and brother go through a lot of stuff that has been 
964 in storage for a long time. I still havn't reconciled myself to the whole 
965 thing. This is only my second experience with the death of somebody I knew,
)66 and the first with a family member. There will always be a whole in my li,
967 but I will continue to live and grow. In one of my last conversations with
968 my father he told me how important it was to finish school. I guess he was
969 proud of me being in College, and I'm sort of glad he never found out how
970 badly I've been doing recently in school. For both he and I, I will someday
971 get my degree. He came so close, withing one term, but didn't quite make it.
972  
973      Well, don't let me0dampen the mood. One of the things I realy enjoy is
974 conversing with everybody on this board.
