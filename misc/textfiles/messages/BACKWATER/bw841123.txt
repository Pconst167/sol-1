22          NOBODY IS PERFECT

24 Each one of us is a mixture of good qualities and some perhaps not so good
25 qualities. In considering our fellow man, we should remember his good 
26 qualities and realize that his faults only prove that he is, after all,
27 a human being. We should refrain from making harsh judgement just
28 because he happens to be a dirty, rotten, no-good son-of-a-bitch...........

30 Leonard : Fine. How would you like the program. IBM to TRS80 Model 1 ss/sd. You convert to Model 3 and send it via
31 null modem? Or over the phone lines sometime? What would you like? And tell me dear sir, didn't you keep backups?
32 A person with as many computers as you should know far better! Shame shame shame...
33 Mikey : I'll re-check the board. The rectifier was taken off board and put on the power supply board to avoid
34 possible heat problems. I'll check around for a short. But we were so careful...sigh...
35 Gaudy Minsky : Thanks for the glowing report on my presentation. To the clod who wondered about possible payments,
36 nothing of the kind existed. It always amazes me how some 'people' manage always to read in the worst into a situation,
37 rather than sit back and make judgement from a position that offers a better view. Again, G.M., thanks.

40 (As I smack the side of my compass once or twice to see if it still works): Sorry L'homme, every once in a while I iss
41 something I shouldn't.  Since in this case it doesn't matter, let's make it east.  By the by, I seem to have frotzed 
42 version of the Original Adventure you gave me.  [Kindly insert the word 'the' after 'frotzed' in the last sentence.]  
43 Seems some jerk I lent the disk to ran the disk timer program on it, wiping out one of the tracks that had most of the
44 program on it.  Could you please remember to have yours handy again next we meet?  (For all those who are wondering,
45 yes, the disk I am talking about is in the public domain.)
46 ++++++++++++++++++++++++
47 I heard screams, and stopped dead in my tracks.  These hideous little blue creatures hopped at a breakneck pace towards
48 us, ignoring the crystal points about them.  They emitted a vile scream that send shivers down my spine.  Their ivory 
49 fangs gleamed brightly as they approached.  They seemed to be in a pack of about 20 or so, and they seemed to be 
50 hungry.  We were so close to the tower!  "'Ware fanged creatures!", I yelled, diving behind the safety of the nearest
51 crystal.  I retreived my 3 X 5 cards and shuffled through them rapidly to find a spell to help.  I hoped the others 
52 were finding similiar things to do.  A card caught my attention... Yes, this might work... I began the chant, started 
53 the motions that would weave into a spell...
54 +++++++++++++++++++++++++
55 Milchar and the others were pinned down behind croppings of crystal.  I luckily had begun my Levitation spell just 
56 before those nasty little devils arrived.  I decided I would help only if they really needed it, I didn't want to give 
57 myself away.  I waited and watched, hoping they could solve the problem themsves...

60 To all the fair citizens of the Backwater Inn:
61      The adventures are enjoyable, the conversation delightful, and the
62 criticism is at least fun to read.  Spell Alert seems to be one of those
63 gung-ho Americans-I'd be willing to bet that he doesn't like Monty Python
64 either('thats not funny...').  Hurray for Bill C - writing feels a lot better
65 than deleting, doesn't it??  The authors on the board are all fantastic--
66 and don't let anyone tell any of you otherwise!!!  Now if I can only get my
67 humble serialisation up to your fine standards, I'll type it in and see if it
68 meets with at least a little approval.  Maybe later this weekend, or next
69 weekend when I'll be home again from the fair burgh of Corvallis.
70 		Keep up with the good tidings, and a
71 Happy Yuletide Season!!

75 lately.  Perhaps you are referring to QUIZMASTER ?  He left one on

78 The hornet's nest stirred up by SPELL ALERT reminds me of something very
79 similar on CBBS/NW a few weeks ago.  As I recall, Steve D. B. and someone 
80 else were 'discussing' the bastardization of the language and how (in)appropriate
81 it is to coin words.  Perhaps we should invite them over here (if they are
82 not already).

85 Mikey: That adventure disk you gave me DOES NOT work. I typed 'RUN ADV', and the program started up, displaying a few
86 garbled words that should appear half-way through the game. Could this be some problems between the Sanyo/IBM?
87 Leonard: I don't know if you are interested in this or not, but I might as well let you know. The Portland Review will
88 be releasing its special Science Fiction - Fantasy - Horrow Anthology in the first week in December. Included in the
89 edition will be art and literature from such local artists as Gary Davis, Matthew Simon, and Jon Tuttle. And some
90 national and international artists like David Sheskin, Elisabeth Stevens and John Borkowski. If you are interested in
91 an issue, send $4 per copy in check or money order to Portland Review, Science Fiction Edition,

110 MADE ERRORS. I KNOW THAT I DO MAKE THEM. AFTER ALL, I AM ONLY HUMAN,
111 WE ALL MAKE ERRORS. PERHAPS MY CONCERN FOR CORRECT SPELLING IS NOT AS
112 GREAT AS OTHERS, BUT IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME IN THE LEAST. IF I USE A
113 WORD OFTEN ENOUGH, I GERNERALY START TO SPELL IT CORRECTLY AFTER A WHILE.
114 THOUGH I DO SEEM TO HAVE SOME SORT OF BLOCK WITH SOME WORDS, AND NEVER
115 SEEM TO GET THEM RIGHT. BUT, AGAIN IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, I GOT MY

131 L'homme: I've GOT backups... but they're all of the M100 version & intermediate
132 steps in the conversion.  I need the ORIGINAL for things like LOCATE (remember
133 THIS version will be running on a 80x25 screen). 
134      As for disk format, you can either tack it onto one of the archive disks
135 or you can put it on a disk formatted like voyeur's archive disks... (Yes I
136 CAN read NEWDOS ssdd disks, it's just a pain using MOVE123 all the time...)

139   Cistop Mikey -- I tend to agree on spelling (I consistently invert ie
140 or ei combinations).  However, in some cases a misspelling gives me a brain
141 warp.  Example:  "I am a gluten for punishment..."  The word you were 
142 looking for was "glutton" -- "gluten" is the stuff that you develop when
143 you knead bread dough.  I had this mental image of you entangled in this
144 large mixing bowl, with flour and strings of dough......
145 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
146   Meanwhile, back in the diamond valley, the piper had not relaxed his
147 vigilance.  Walking with the air of a man who did not trust the happenings
148 around him, he followed the others toward the towering citadel.  When a 
149 group of howling blue creatures (not unlike smurfs that had been reading
150 too much Robert Louis Stevenson) appeared on an intersection course with
151 the party he did not feel particularly surprised.  Apprehensive, yes.
152 Fearful, yes.  Terrified? yes.  Surprised? no.
153   The piper reasoned that  this group did not necessarily have to be 
154 hostile.  He could think of lots of cases where primitive peoples rushed
155 out to meet visitors.  Sometimes they would wear quaint native costumes.
156 Sometimes they would wave quaint native spears.  Sometimees they would
157 impale the visitors on the quaint native spears.
158   Milchar had hit the dirt behind a crystal formation and was fumbling
159 in his deck of 3x5 cards.  The rest of the party had already taken cover
160 and the piper was standing here philosophizing!  Catching sight of him,
161 the pack started toward him, and the piper really doubted that their 
162 intentions were pacific.  He felt at his waist for his dirk, then realized
163 thjat its eighteen inch length was far too short for this type of work.
164   He fumbled in his sporran for a moment, hoping to find a more useful
165 weapon, then came out holding a queerly shaped stick.  Glancing at it 
166 a moment, he shrugged.  It was worth a chance.  He placed one end of he
167 stick to his mouth and blew.  A thin reedy sound came out, barely audibe
168 over the sound of the blue beasts.  As the pack started for the piper,
169 ignoring the rest of the party (isn't it amazing how much cover a few
170 crystals give?)  the leaders begain to quiet as they came within earshot
171 of the queer noise he was making.  The followers crashed into the leaders,
172 causing a few nasty gouges and snaps, but they, too, soon quieted down
173 listening to the strange sound issuing from the piper.
174   The piper smiled over his practice chanter at his new-found audience.
175 They were certainly not a prepossesing lot, but he was a person of little
176 cultural prejudice.  The piper played on.

180 There seems to be a change comming to the board of late.  Did I detect the
181 presence of a couple of neophytes to the Inn?  Did someone actually seemd
182 to be novices to some area of the computer kingdom?  Hail, and well met!!
183 To those PSU "bums":  you bring a breathe of fresh air to a sometimes 
184 overly stuffy and stale environment.  Keep your presence felt here!

193 Voyeur : Saw a long commercial for Dune on that music station (the name escapes
194 me now). Stunning! I can't wait until it opens (December 14th) It may not
195 be the book, but from first glance, it looks like it can hold out on its own!
196 I'll make an adventure entry later. Thanks piper...I didn't want to return to

210 All:  I am back!!!  After a long and tedious absence I have returned.  
211 Milchar:  Would it be possible to encorporate me into this storyline?  I would

243     Hello folks, I haven't logged in for about 4 days and it looks
244 like I missed the (spelling trap) Actually I am relieved since I
245 know I most likely had the most words missed.. enough of that drivel..
246 I went and saw BUCKAROO BANZI last night and found it most entertaining.
247 I love the comic book format!!! anyway Ill log off now ans I be back
248 with another thrilling chapter?
249 ********************************kathy*************************************
250 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
251 Kathy; where did you see Buckaroo?  I went with 7 other people including the Doctor above Friday night at Town Center.
252 I enjoyed the movie, was reminded of my bedroom by looking at the crazy laboratory settings, but found it lacking 
253 somewhat.  Perhaps if the storyline had been stronger than 'this is the way it is, so don't try to explain it'.
254 Doctor; you know what my number is, and we'll be seeing each other tomorrow anyway, so I doubt that you will have 
255 problems finding out what the storyline is.  Say, how long is your mother's office going to let you have that thing on
256 loan?  Can I borrow your printer since you have a much faster one there?  Hmmmm?
257 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
258 I was suddenly struck with the notion that these little beings were remarkably similar to the Smurfs found on Earth. I
259 shuddered involuntarily.  Wait... I think I have a 'Summon Gargamel' spell down here somewhere.  I had barely found it
260 when I heard the thin notes of a strange wind instument being played by Piper.  Those little devils seemed to enjoy the
261 music, for at leat they had quieted down a little and sat down.  Now that they were still for a bit, I thought of a 
262 way of escape.  Trying to be as quiet as possible, I found another 3 X 5 card that I felt was appropriate for the 
263 occasion.  I gathered together the rest of the cards and put them into one of the many folds on my robe.  I hoped the 
264 crystal had the right qualities for what I was going to do.  Chanting very softly, I touched my wand to a branching of
265 the crystal.  It promptly molded itself into a flat square, perfect for what I needed.  Again and again I touched 
266 crystals, until I had encircled the group with little flat squares hanging onto the formations.  I was about to ask 
267 someone for a light source whea beam of light suddenly flashed from one square and leaped to another... on and on this
268 went, until we vanished in the circle of light that had formed.
269 Vanished from there.... to where?
270 +++++++++++++++++++++++++
271 My jaw dropped open.  Wholesale transportation of matter was something I had thought was beyond Milchar's abilities.
272 I couldn't yet do it consistently, sometimes things got a little frotzed up along the way, if you know what I mean...
273 I was very thankful for the Levitation spell now that the Piper had gone and the Smurfies were again loose.  I moved 
274 over them, toward the citidel to the east.  I hoped that they had gone there, for if they hadn't, I would never find 
275 them again.
276 +++++++++++++++++++++++++
277 I sighed at the expenditure of power.  the knack of transporting matter lies in supplying enough energy to keep the 
278 link fully open.  I gave much to allow those ones to come nearer.  I wondered at what their reaction would be to this 
279 entire mess.  I remembered how their journey began, a pleasure trip to see the beauty of the Ruby Valley.  And how it
280 now was, the quest to find out about a necklace made of Four Powers.  Ah, yes, and their time was running out.  Mariani
281 needed that necklace to stop the sickness in the water.  And of course, something that nearly all had forgot, the Blue 
282 Demon himself.  Someone who those dreadful little Smurfies worshipped as a god.  Little wonder why they called him 
283 'Papa'.  A lot of little loose ends on this trip.  Well, they would find out about it all soon enough.

291      Ontho was waiting patiently for Leo, the Inmo's mind was
292 whirrling thinking of the mission ahead.  Hopeing that Leo could
293 keep her cool for a change. Certain of danger, ready to act. Ontho
294 had upped (his?)own personal defense system with a handy dandy laser
295 weapon and the new invisablitly shield. Ontho had also been thinking
296 about the pain in (his?) skull. The new intellegence was taking it's
297 toll. Hopefully they would complete the mission before total burnout
298 occured.
299      Leo dragged in, late.. how could I have slept so late? She thought
300 to herself. The Innkeepper must have spiced up her tea. No that couldn't
301 be it. Anyway, here I am. She jumped up on the disk and took her seat.
302 Ontho set the disk for (screamming) and they were gone!
303      Iceland was in view in no time, they flew over the spot where the
304 previous event had occured and saw no trace of the small craft. It was
305 gone.  Ontho slowed the disk so they could survey the earth, nothing
306 caught their eyes right away.  Leo opened her sack lunch and started
307 to peal a banana. Had skipped breakfast so this was welcome. Ontho 
308 was keeping a close lookout.
309      The hours dragged, nothing had happened and the sun was starting
310 to set.BRRRRR god it was getting cold, Leo wrapped her parka closer
311 to herself and peered over the disk. Ontho had retired for a couple of
312 hours and it was her turn to watch, although she didn't have the 
313 atvantage of 8 eyes she did have 20/20 vision. She thought she saw
314 something move on the surface and zoomed down to take a look, oh nothing
315 but a man and his dogsled. The invisablitly shield was on so the man
316 didn't see them. She zoomed back up to a better observation spot.
317 Night had closed in and she could she the northern lights, it was a
318 awesome sight and gave her a warm feeling inside. She could also see
319 the occasional lights of nomad travelers.

321 I saw BUCKAROO BANZI at washington square. I really liked the movie but
322 I felt like keeping my feet off the floor durring the whole show. The
323 place was so filtly I was worried about catching aids or something.IEEEE
324 like i said before, i havent logged on for a while and i must have missed
325 my adventure and zork clues, I still need help!! ill be logging in again
326 tomorrow night after midnight. We will most likely be on a another new
327 disk again.  Help!!
328   also sorry about the borring entry, but sometimes things don't move
329 as fast as we would like. Leo gets so impatient with me, This will cool
330 her jets, ehh.

333 Piper: I got a laugh out of that, but maybe I was closer to the truth with
334 gluten, (at least figurativly). But yes, you are right, I did mean glutton
335 originaly.
336 By the way, I think you may have created a monster in the universal slime pits.
337 Leonard: No, I am still trying to get hold of CIS. Of late, I have been trying
338 to reach Sandy Trevor (VP of engineering) in the hopes of getting thru that way.
339 I at least got him to call back once, of course I wasn7t in when he called. Sigh.
340 But maybe there is hope. I would be very grateful for any help you could provide
341 for this madness.
342 Archivers: Given your responses, I assume you are still interested in the
343 archives. So the new format will be no header, line numbers will be given,
344 A new tag line will be added at the end indicating the total number of lines
345 in the file. I will be distributing the new format on MSDOS disks. Is this 
346 acceptable? This allows a consistant 6 files per disk format which is easy
347 for me to generate since my CPM system from which it is initialy generated
348 holds 3 files per disk. Finally, I am currently only striping control Z,
349 I need to know if this is acceptable, or if you wish other characters to
350 be striped.

354 The Innkeeper woke late, and got up to look out into the Inn proper.
355 Yes, there were still glasses littering the tables, so it wasn't
356 a dream. What new vistas had been opened, and what new adventures would
357 come? Fears to overcome, memories to store, joys to savour. 
358 Getting up and dressed, he moves out to do the days chores.

362   After becoming an acomplice before the fact in a pedestrian killing, I got home a few hours earlier than I had hoped.
363   During the inquiry, the driver simply stated that he was not insensitive to the plight of the elderly;
364   He simply didn't see any reason for the continued existance of slower pedestrian...
365   That man is sick, and should not, will not be released for some time to come.

367   A more pleasant subject is that of the Spell Check huntSince your presence here lends itself simply to agitation and the
368 point has been made, why do you not simply apologizeopenly to those you have offended?  Or even simply shut down the HP for a
369 while.  Say, eight months or until spelling is very, very bad?

371   KATHY; Mayhaps you would care for a small round o'pente?  The logistics seem at first glance to be easy.  20x20 grid?

377     Dear Kathy:
378 
379            
380           What ZORK are you on? And of that ZORK what part do you need help with?
381   If it is a solution you want ,clean and clear,I have a printout of ZORK I solved.
382   If you are interested in hints.What have you accomplished? Information that you allready have would be worthless. would
383  It not?
384    Aneyway. If you want the help, It is here.

388 Mikey: Ok, I can either bring hard copy, or I can put it on a 256 byte/sector
389 18 sector/track, 40 track disk. To make things WEIRD, I can make it one big
390 file with no directory (^Z between entries?). OR I could just put it on a 
391 normal TRSDOS disk...
392     As for the ^Z, could you just set the high bit? That way it would still be
393 there, but wouldn't screw up CP/M. If not, no problem.
394    Further disk note: as long as tit's 40 track, 18 sector, 256 byte etc, I can
395 do just about anything as far as getting that info on disk for you. (Direct
396 sector I/O from basic is NICE sometimes!)

400 Gaudy M. Thanks for the date on the article. 
401 Anybody have theater recomendations for where I should see B.Banzai?
402 Leonard: Was it a bad day for you? you normaly don't confuse me with others... 
403 And nothing screews up my printer, I don't have one here! My printing is done at
404 L&C. I assume that your 16K pack still  functions?
405 Theus: I called SALOG again, our fearless leader wants us to blow up a fort
406 in Idaho. He talks about sanctions against the Nazi's there. Did you make
407 sure you got the payment in this month on the black van? Oh yes, your not going
408 to like this, SALOG has issued us a bodyguard/driver. Sort of, he likes to drink.
409 He drives the Banfield at 150 KPH. He told me about hitting this little old 
410 lady on the way over. Your right, he is sick-o. And we can't dump him, he knows
411 where the damn fort is. God, the things I do for my country.
412 Allen/Mary:What kind of software do you need? Nice to see new faces that have
413 some brains behind them, there are too many Vic-20 twits around.
414 Asp:Kathy is playing adventure on a PDP 11/70, Zork hints may not work too well.

417 Mikey:MSDOS disks? No problem. In fact, that will save me quite a bit of work converting from 8" to 5.25" formats.
418 Kathy: The hint on the pirate treasure chest is on disk b. Did you miss it? If so, I can repeat the hint, if you wish.
