21 Wow!!!!  Made it to the top!!!  Hey Mikey what on earth are
22 you doing up so early in the morning?
23 
24      Leo hestitated before opening the craft, after the fast
25 hot heat of the trident, the latch was almost welder shut.
26 Using a trusty churchkey that she had carried with her for
27 a few years, she pried open the cover.
28      Ontho in the meantime had anchored the disk and jumped
29 down and moved to Leo's side, curious about the contents as
30 she was.  Toghther they opened the lid, "oh yuko, barfo" Leo
31 looked away in, her face turning the color of Ontho's skin.
32 (green). " Ontho I'll let you do the checking" Ontho was already
33 inspecting the remains of a small child. (see I told you..
34 yuko, barfo!). It seemed as if the child was the sole occupant
35 of the craft. "trazz cwzz dazzm" Ontho had discovered a comunication
36 device in the form of a metal headband around the skull of the
37 child. 
38     Ontho had come to the conclusion that the headband was more
39 than a communication device, that it also was the source of a
40 powerfull mind control device.  Ontho had trouble removing the
41 device, because probes seemed to penatrate the actual bone of
42 the skull.  Ontho scurried back to their disk, where Leo was
43 resting, getting over her sudden illness. Ontho picked up a
44 box and headed back to the craft, where the Inmo took the entire
45 skull and placed it in the box, not wanting to futher damage the
46 device.
47      Leo was feeling quite guilty about the death of the child,
48 and was not prepared for such a ordeal so soon in her new career.
49 Finally she got ahold of her self and went back to the craft to
50 join Ontho, who was examming the underneath of the craft. Leo
51 got down on her stomach and looked too. She saw the bay type
52 doors under the vehicle were open and the contents gone.
53      "By golly this is a real mystery, Let's head back to head-
54 quarters and get this headband examined." Ontho agreed that was
55 a good idea, the rest of the craft really was quite ordinary and
56 they really didn't need the dismembered body either. Leo closed
57 the lid on the craft. She thought of the child, and then walked
58 slowly back to the disk where Ontho had already powered up and
59 was ready to go.
60      "Can you imagine the bastards that have children do their
61 dirty work for them?" She said outloud and to herself.

68      Mez was quietly quenching his thirst and listening to first one story
69 then another. The Inn was a-swirl with great fare for the mind. A voice close
70 by was calling his name.
71      "Why Laz", he said, looking up, "I thought you were permanently lodged
72 in 'lurker' mode. How nice to see you here again." He listened to the new
73 arrival for a moment then swept his hand toward one of the chairs around the
74 table. "Analysis? Do have a seat and some refreshment."
75      While the shuffling and other arrangements were going on Mez pondered
76 the question of analysis. When everyone was comfortable he turned to Laz and
77 said, "Honestly, my opinion is that there is entirely to much analysis of
78 events these days. More and more people are looking to others to tell them
79 what things mean, rather phan thinking about it for themselves. Just look at
80 99% of the comments concerning the recent political happenings. In the whole
81 they were mostly reiterations of media positions. One set for each faction.
82 I'm personally in favor of the revival of independent thought."
83      "The only aspect of the results that would dictate caution is the trend
84 toward more suppression or filtering of information by the forces in power.
85 This is not a new technique, of course, it has been practiced through out
86 history. It must continually be balanced by those who seek to understand
87 rather than just accept the projected reality."

91 Hmmm, gone again? OK, one more time...
92 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
93      A  small  huddled figure lay near a fire that  only  glowing 
94 embers.  There was a tensness about him as if in great fear.  His 
95 sleep obviously troubled.  Suddenly he awakens with a start.  The 
96 nightmare of death had returned. Fear shook his body. he had been 
97 promised it would not return,  but now it was back.  What was the 
98 cause of this broken promise? Why had the nightmare returned?    
99      He  was beyond sleep now,  so Tarn built the fire back up to 
100 await the sunrise, leaned against the rock wall, pulled his knees 
101 to  his chest,  and stared into the flickering  flames.  So  many 
102 years had passed,  Tarn had thought he had won free of the curse, 
103 but  here  it was again back to haunt him.  It was not so much  a 
104 dream as a presence.  A dark presence of death itself slowly  and 
105 ever increasingly closing in on him. It was no use trying to stay 
106 awake  fighting  it,  it  always came upon him sooner  or  later, 
107 biding its time until it could.                                  
108      Tarn  sat  in the darkness relieved only by  the  flickering 
109 light  of the fire and thought back on what lead him to  live  in 
110 this lonely cave,  away from the rest of the world. Attempting to 
111 restore some semblance of order to his life and soul.  The  wars, 
112 those  hateful  wars that tore his family from him,  forcing  him 
113 away from his friends, and striped him of his possessions he held 
114 so dear.                                                         
115      The Inn where he had found a moments rest and comfort, where 
116 he had met Emer...  Ah Emer,  dear Emer,  where have you gone?  I 
117 searched  so long for you,  but always you eluded me.  Unable  to 
118 deal  with  the loss Tarn had fallen to  drunkenness,  a  pitiful 
119 wretch  of  a man.  Until a boisterous elfe by the name of  Robin 
120 Goodfellow  had shaken him out of his wallowing  self  pity,  and 
121 forced him to think about his life,  and living. Crawling to this 
122 remote mountain cave, Tarn tryed to heal the hurt, to resolve the 
123 pain,  but the task seemed insurmountable.  A great emptyness lay 
124 inside  him that he was unable to fill or heal.  Instead he found 
125 himself praying that she would return to fill the empty void once 
126 more.                                                            
127      The  dawn finally came with the first morning light  finding 
128 Tarn  still huddled before the fire,  a tear slowly traversing  a 
129 crevice in his cheek.                                            
130                           *O* Tarn *O*

144 =======================================================================
145 Walrus and the other person talking about writing another backwater
146 type system. Many have boasted such ideas, but to date, NO ONE HAS
147 gone through with it. I include that travesty The Corkboard in my
148 sweeping statement. Instead of asking others if there is any interest
149 in putting together a system, why don't you just do it. There are
150 very few people who are capable of writing a good bulletin board
151 system themselves. I am not talking about the apple fools who bring
152 up another pirated Ascii Express line, or the morons who change the
153 print statements and menu selections on Apple NETWORKS, and call it
154 their own.
155 Consider the multitude of BBSs in town. How many are REALLY written
156 by their sysops. Go ahead and go through the list. Almost every
157 system is some commercial product, or more likely, so product that
158 has been pirated and changed just a tad. The Bit Bucket, BWMS,
159 Electric Ark, Radio Shack network, and Bee Color are the only
160 notable systems in town written by either the sysops or someone
161 close by. The rest of the non-commercial systems are marginal at
162 best, have flakey hours, are full of bugs, have incredibly bad
163 user interfaces, or are down 90% of the time. Talk is cheap. Results
164 are the only thing that can be believed in.

170 *******************************************************************
171 LAZ: Not to deflate your comment from above, but I did not write
172 BWMS (gasp!). What I did was to take a commercial product that
173 I happen to have laying around, and changed some of the headers
174 and such to say what they do now, add to that a few patchs to fit
175 this enviornment, and that is what BWMS is. Now admittedly, I had
176 a hand in designing the hardware, and as a result to some extent 
177 indirectly the design of the software, BUT I DIDN'T WRITE IT!
178 BWMS is up most of the time as are most of the other 'stable'
179 systems because I don't change the thing every day, and the hardware
180 is totaly dedicated to being a BBS. That is the problem with
181 most of the other systems that come and go, it runs on the only
182 computer the sysop has, and as a result, they can't keep their
183 hands off the bloody thing. Add to that the dissatisfaction 
184 of not getting alot of callers rightaway, and most of those being
185 hackers out looking for systems to crash, it is no wonder that
186 few of the systems survive. You talk about poor user interface,
187 BWMS is hardly among the top 10 in being 'user friendly', but,
188 it is resonably consistent, and with a bit of bumbling around
189 you can get to learn the basic commands rather quickly. Starting with
190 LIST, then moving on to ENTER, and maybe HELP, which of course
191 leads to some of the other commands. Simplicity is the calling
192 of the BWMS system, not being fancy, but then it couldn't be
193 anything else given the whole basis around which it was designed.

207 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
208   From HPrometheus: The Designed
209   Nice evening to you all. I have a question of some interest to all those who tried to come up with the perfect delay, and
210 failed, other than to default to NULL (&0).
211   Although the question has only been slightly mentioned, it is important to us all.  And I know now how important.
212   You see, I was using MODEM7 on an Osborne I, thusly having my first real use of a viewport.  They are not good!  With the
213 added complication of varying line lengths with almost everybody, it is seemingly impossible to read a single disk!
214   In any case, is 79 characters the perfect line length? Is 32, since that is the CoCo line length, and the shortest length on
215 any popular computer that I know of.  Or was the Doctor right and 126 fun for all?
216   Confused as I seem to have made you, I will proceed with regularly scheduled dribble.                                       
217   Pam, I was delighted to hear a response from you, but am I that bumbling?
218   Buckaroos, I can, and will attend this Fributwhere is it that I am supposed to attend?
219   Man in Gray, I talked to GREGORY again. His real name is Larry, and is psychotic it seems. After an afternoon of 'Political
220 discussions' I ended up with the instruction on converting the Czechoslavakian Skorpion to 45mm or so. 
221   After I finally got him to understand what I wanted. I did get the docs on the PETN shape charges after all. Come by the lot
222 and we'll discuss it all.

225 ************************************************************
226 Kathy: We've got you hooked eh? (You friendly neighborhood BBS pusher.)
227 Prometheus: At one time there was an attempt to standardize on 76
228 characters per line. It had some success, but there are those who prefer
229 longer lines. Definatly not 32 though! It looks horrid on a decent 
230 terminal. By assuming the standard terminal as being 80 column wide,
231 and assuming you are going to have line numbers of some sort, this means
232 the best aspect is to subtract the number of maximum line number positions
233 used (4 on BW (3 for the number, and one for the space)) from 79. Can't use 80, 
234 as a lot of terminals/programs do an auto return after the 80th character.
235 Thus idealy for BWMS 75 is the best length.
236 This is assuming you want it to look nice on a 'normal' terminal (What ever
237 that is!)
238 ************************* CISTOP MIKEY *********************************
239 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
240 'Normal'?  What's that?
241 L'homme; I had this funny little feeling deep down about your stack space, and if you will recall I did ask about 
242 how much stack you had available.  I'll be happy to help you out with the paint, but I warn you it'll be the 
243 largest ML program I have written to date (many small ones, none very large).
244 Alex; know anything about the 6522?  I'm dissecting a ML program that deals with it quite a lot.  It has 15 
245 registers, $0 to $E.  Sound familiar?  Is it a more primitive version of the 6526 (Commodore's CIA)?
246 Walrus; Thank you for even that little tidbit, that's the most I have been able to find out from anyone.  I have not
247 answered you before for one of two reasons: 1) I missed the question [It does happen]   2) It didn't refer to me 
248 and it didn't interest me.  Don't feel that I think your entries to be not worthy of reply.  They are.  I just did.
249 All; just following a bit of advice from L'homme (sometimes it is good, you should listen to him), not entering
250 anything about the story until another puts in a good section. Waiting, waitning, waiting...

253 <(::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::)>
254 Ho, boy, I've got quite a list of messages today, so I'd better get started.
255 Robt F: Thanks for the suggestion, a very good one at that, so if all goes
256 	well, my new board will be called "Vox Populi"
257 Laisez: Well, true, Rome was a Networks conversion, but I put many hours
258 	into programming it.  I added more features, and changed more things
259 	than any other Networks that I know of.  Also, I want to find out if
260 	people want Vox Populi before I write it because if no one wants it,
261 	why bother?  It's disheartening to spend hours programming a BBS and
262 	not even know if anyone is going to call it.  But, I can understand
263 	your skepticism.
264 Pam:    Yes, spelling is definately not one of my strong points.  But, if it
265 	matters, I usually have "that feeling" when I misspell something
266 	that it's not right.  My literary form isn't very good either, but
267 	a Networks board will do that to you.
268 Voyeur: No offense intended, but is your pseudonom to be taken literally?
269 Mesol.: Very true, but you must have a balance of reason and faith.  You ob-
270 	viously can't test EVERYTHING yourself, you must rely on others for
271 	certain concepts.  But, of course, reality is a personal construction.
272 Kathy:  I enjoy your writing very much, but could you change your border?
273 	It is the same as Mikey's, so it can sometimes cause confusion.

276 L'homme: laying in bed last night, staring at TEVA HEOP... when I should have
277 been getting my beauty sleep, it finally came to me: THE ANSWER YOU.....
278 I suppose, therefor, that you may not have been BSing us after all.
279 Alex: I attempted to apply your Cryptology 95 lesson to Milchar's little puzzle.
280 I'm afraid I didn't get past the letter frequency.  What do you mean by
281 factoring the number of characters? (Milchar's puzzle was 56 chr long: 2*2*2*7?
282 Is that what you meant?  So?)  This is supposed to define the boundaries of teh
283 code. (teh?  damned Enter Only)  'The grouping of the code a factor of its 
284 length'?  How about stepping thru an example for me?  It would make things
285 much clearer, I'm sure.
286 Out of curiosity, I ran the BW Archives from late August/september thru a
287 frequency count.  It came out somewhat close to your table, although I think
288 it was skewed slightly by things like borders (pipers probably weighted the 
289 P's kinda heavily, I saw a lot of Q's, stuff like that).
290 Out of 216,312 chrs tested, 149,794 were valid (A-Z,a-z):
291 E  11.9%	T  9.3		O  8.1		A  7.7		I  6.9
292 N  6.4		S  6.4		R  5.7		H  5.0		L  4.2
293 D  3.5		U  3.2		M  2.7		C  2.7		P  2.6  etc
294 50% of the letters are E, T, O, A, I, & N.  The rest are just for window-dressin
295 I guess.
296 Walrus: If you substitute participating on this BBS for sex, then my
297 pseudonym is how I felt when I first began accessing this board.  I lurked
298 for a long time before joining in.  'voyeur' is no longer really appropriate,
299 but it's the (major) name I've used for a long time.  It has changed from
300 being a description, to being a name.
301 (actually, the answer is a bit more complex than that, but this is good enough
302 for here/now).
303 L'homme: shall I call you at RHC to discuss the situation vis-a-vis Buckaroo
304 Banzai?  (if you answer after 08:30, I won't see it...then try calling me X5430)
305 ::::::::::::::::O O::::::::::::voyeur::::::::::::::O O:::::::::::::::::
306 Prometheus: I hate to tell you this, but a VERY popular machine (don't ask me
307 WHY it was popular) had a 22 character wide display. There are STILL some poor
308 fools using VIC-20s to call BBS's!
309   Also, you mentioned delay chars and then wandered off before making your
310 point (something about Osborne & MODEM7?). There is the Unrtu (ARRRGH! @#%^^*
311 enter only! BW just turned a char into DEL.....)
312 unfortunate problem of so MANY control chars being used for SOMETHING! With
313 NULL at least it was INTENDED as "filler". 
314    I never did get the story on why your "home-built" program couldn't send
315 nulls....

318      "Laz, I can certainly appreciate that, however, it is nice that you
319 dropped by for a bit of refreshment. I should think you would be pleased
320 with the results of recent events, speaking in terms of the free market,
321 rather than a federally controlled economy. One question is how can the
322 free market be encouraged to engage in investigations that will only show
323 results in the future, rather than spending massive ammounts of energy on
324 endeavors that only promise immediate gain?"
325      While the mathematician was 'wetting his whistle', he leaned forward
326 so he could hear what the Tusky fellow across the table was saying. Then
327 he leaned back, wiped his hand across his beard and said, "Perhaps a few
328 more words might clear up the confusion, Mr. W.. It's the tendency toward
329 having events and situations explained, rather than being given the 'raw'
330 data and an opportunity to formulate one's own conclusions, that seems to
331 be a concept we should question. So, considering opening an establishment
332 of your own, are you? The only thing I can tell you is that the kind of
333 place you run determines the type of clientele, and the type of clientele
334 determines the kind of place it is. You might get away with a quiet check
335 of identification at the door, but if you insist on pinning name tags on
336 everyone you'll not be getting the free expression of opinion you see
337 here at the Inn.", he took another long swallow from his glass.
338      Turning to face the bar he called, "Innkeeper, I tip my hat to you,
339 you run an excellent establishment here. Another round when you get a
340 chance, please."

371 voyeur,
372         By determining the letter frequency we insure ourselves that this 
373 code conforms to the knowen alphabet. So with that information we move on to
374 what other forms of encipherment are posible within the constraints of a
375 normal alphabet. Starting with the more simple and moving towards the arcane.
376 Most are some form of transpostition. Based often on some geometric figure ie.
377 squares, rectangles and triangles. Now here is where the factoring of the
378 number of characters comes into play. You were on the right path but you
379 reduced 56 to its PRIME factors as opposed to its INTEGER factors.
380 So now we have  1x56 2x28 4x14 7x8 ....now is the code grouping (in fours)
381 a nice factor of any of the above combinations ? 2x28 would mean every other
382 letter was part of a word...you could probably see that...4x14 probably
383 the same .....leaving.....7x8...a nice rectangle two groups (8 characters)
384 across/down and 7 lines/columns ....Try the analysis on the message Leonard
385 left me on DB.
386  
387 Leonard,
388         Naw....nuking is more fun....SPEAKING of WHICH...what say we riskers

390  
391 L'homme ,
392         Indeed ! ! ! I do wish those manuals.....perhaps buried in there 
393 somewhere is a decent routine to allow illegal characters to be read from and
394 written to disk...that does NOT screw something else up in the process.....
395  
396 Milch,
397         Nope...when it comes to chips....The only way I can take them is with

406      A crisp autumn day, alive with a brisk wind and unfettered leaves 
407 that dash joyously about the cobblestones, like puppies with sparkling
408 eyes and mischevious aims:  they swirl at the feet of the Inngoers, cheeky
409 escorts in the sunshine.  And a bustling crowd there is, with many familiar
410 faces amidst them...Leonard, with that disarming smile and open manner;
411 L'homme, intent in conversation, his hand flailing in unison; the none-
412 so-quiet Voyeur with eyes that rove constantly through the Inn, greeting
413 companions; Phantom Glitch, ever in his quiet corner; the startling
414 figure of Mez, with bare feet propped on the hearth and beard quivering
415 in intensity as he waxes philisophocal to Laissez-faire; drooped over
416 an ale at one table, Tarn, with eyes meeting no ones, but emiting soul-
417 ful sighs as if in invitation; Alex, emanating that blissful content
418 that only comes from being part of the Backwater's aura, leaning back
419 leisurely in his chair and watching the crowd with his intelligent eyes...
420 Surveying it all with a lop-sided grin, the Innkeeper, our beloved Mikey;
421 he keeps murmering "Pam...now where did she get to?"  Many others mill
422 about, not quite so familiar, yet they have caught the sense of magic
423 that lingers about the Inn and stoke the flames of it:  there, she's one;
424 a breathless figure that arrives at the front door, delightedly scans 
425 the crowd, and brandishes her feather pen.  Her greeters call her Kathy.
426      
Into this motley crew, a small figure slips unnoticed, with dark
427 hair and green-lit eyes.  She wends her way silently to the hearth,
428 wafting a scent of apricot from the silky garment that billows around
429 her, the purest of white.  A bit of a flame is left from the eve past,
430 weaving amidst the coals, and it chuckles as if recognizing her.  She
431 only smiles, keeping still so as to look on at the Inn's merry crowd...

443 exploring the vwestern front in a wagon train!
444   No sod houses, I simply started stealing little bits of a dissassembly and an old terminal program, and ended up with this.
445   As to nulls, I tweaked the blasted thing and thiis line is the test.

448   CISTOP MIKEY, should I therefore switch to 75 columns? I was, by the way,being sarcastic about 32 columns. Thank you for

476 Alex; a pity, I thought perhaps I could rely on you for help... oh, well.
477 Whoever above about the 6822; if you're quite sure, could you post 
478 what each of the registers do?  I'm working with a program that uses a 
479 very odd method of high-speed transmission to the disk drive (uses the
480 ATN line for a clock line and uses the clock line and the serial line to
481 send two bits at once instead of one), and I'd like to know what it's
482 doing when it LDA #$0B's and then STA $DD00's.
483 L'homme; I have seen an editor/assembler package for the 64, can't remember
484 the name of the whole thing but the files were called 'editor64',
485 'assembler64', 'hiloader', 'lowloader', etc.  Is this the same as the one
486 you have?  If so, the friend who has this package has problems saving
487 source files... can you explain?  Thanks.
488 All; when is the next PorSFiS meeting, so I can work on getting the day off?
489 ++++++++++++++++++++++
490 I awoke on a bed of soft straw, one of the most comfortable I have ever seen.
491 A young man of about 24 in grey robes stood nearby, quietly observing me.
492 My head still pounded with the force of the field exploding.  As a matter of
493 fact, my whole body hurt.  "Water", I mumbled weakly, and before I knew 
494 the man had gone, he was back with a glass of water.  I downed it quickly 
495 and found breath to ask him where I was, who he was, and what had happened.
496 He had anticipated my questions and rattled off a brief reply, still 
497 examining me as if I were a specimen on a slide.  I had this queer feeling
498 something important was going on elsewhere... it passed.  I looked about
499 and saw my magical items nearby... my book, my 3 X 5 cards, my wand... but 
500 where was the ring?  I had the magic back, wbut where had the ring gone?
501 And how did this stuff return from the sand, anyway?  I asked the man
502 about all of these things as I put each of my objects back into their
503 places among the many pockets and folds of my robes.  Drat- no material
504 components.  Have to get some.  Might come in handy.  Frotz, now I had m
505 issed half of what Novar had said (that was his name).  "...off to the
506 Diamond Valley, where they are solving a puzzle...", he had said.  My
507 friends!  They had gone on to find the last piece, the last one!  I grabbed
508 at my neck, and yes, the necklace was still there, faintly glowing.  I
509 wondered what that meant...
510 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Milchar, 10:49 on 11/16/84 ++++++++++++++++++++++
511 I'm not sure who asked, but the next
512 meeting of the PorSFiS(?) is THIS
513 saturday(11-17-84) at 2 pm.  Also,
514 the name of the assembler system that
515 was talked of above is "ASSEMBLER64".
516 I have had no problems with it so far.
517 If anyone wants a copy, leave me a
518 message here or on most any other
519 board.  One last thing, I have info
520 on the registers for the 6522 if
521 anyone needs it.......................
