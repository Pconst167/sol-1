I didn't notice it at the time, but it was the beginnings of a memory chip
failing in the Sanyo. I didn't ctach it until several disks later when 
there was a complete failure.

 20 The Big Bang Theory:
 21 Imagine that you are an ant on a sponge. Suddenly the sponge explodes.
 22 As each piece flies apart from every other peice, all the pieces are 
 23 equally far away from one another. The pieces farthest away are are going 
 24 faster than you are. One day every piece of sponge except us will will be
 25 out of sight. Too late then to wish we had been on a faster piece of
 26 sponge. This is the Big Bang Theory. Before the big bang we must imagine 
 27 a glowing ball of something, without any edges. This is the ball which,
 28 by a process not understood, turned into a sponge.

 32 Cultist? Yes, in a way, but a cultist of a different color. I do not consider
 33 myself a Jonsian-styled cultist. Because of this, I always run a chemical
 34 analysis on any koolaid I might be offered. A love of music and art might be
 35 considered a cult - a cult of a mindset steeped in expression and presentation.
 36  
 37 Life is like a sine wave of varying amplitude and frequency. The peaks and
 38 valleys are composed of different heights and depths, and the distance from
 39 the minima/maxima of valley/peak is also in constant flux. Always changing,
 40 up and down, our lives and our life flows always forward. One day feels
 41 greater than the next. Next week brings utter despair and the accompanying
 42 depths. The slope is forever changing. The derivatives of the line that
 43 traces this path must always be recalculated.
 44 Life might be a cult. We put so much energy into it. We give up everything
 45 for it. We put all our hopes and dreams on it. And if we lose those hopes
 46 and dreams, we might as well drink fully of that tainted liquid despair.

 52    Addiction - and Cults.  Put the two together, shaken, not stirred, and
 53 you end up with a Cult of Addiction.  Shades of THX 1138!  Is there really
 54 addiction to anything?  Or is every redundent habit an addiction, an
 55 affliction, a rash that we dig, groovy huh?  Cults are addictions to
 56 religion, maybe.  But I know one thing; Cults were never my strong
 57 point.  Why should I listen to other people about how to screw up my
 58 life more effectively than I ever could do for myself?  My brain would
 59 be mush before I would consider shaving my head for starving children and
 60 taking money to feed my Zen Master in a New York High-Rise.  Let me
 61 make my own victories, and my own mistakes.  And if I don't learn from
 62 my mistakes, then I guess I'll just have to suffer.  Or do I still impact
 63 everyone around me if I make a mistake?  Zounds, my mind is wandering!

115 Stray Cat : I will not enter in to any sort of border conflict, but I will
116 point out a couple things: I have been using this random sequence of characters
117 from the top row of the keyboard since approximately 1984. As the keeper of the
118 BW archives, it is my business to track such important event sequences in BW
119 history. Secondly, one of the reasons I chose such a border is that NO ONE
120 can lay claim to a random sequence of alpha characters. It changes every time,
121 an ever mutating boundary that signifies a beginning and an end. Like the
122 wind and the land and the sky, it can be owned by no one, and used by all.
123 You are the first person to ever claim it as solely (ie MY) their own. I
124 think there are enough permutations to go around for us all. I will continue
125 to utilize the wonders of random muscular exertions on the keyboard, as I
126 have been doing for the past four years. I believe the phrase is "let your

257 representation of the entire International Data Transfer System.  John and 
258 Mark stole from this system.  It was the only way they could live.
259      The red warm up light kept blinking on and off, on and off.  It lulled 
260 John into a small trance, calling up repressed thoughts from his 
261 subconscious.  He began mantaly talking to himself.  Marks getting to weak 
262 for this, he thought.  I should take care of him, not kill him.  Who knows 
263 what a mental shock could do to him.  Johns Mother had made him promise to 
264 watch over Mark before she had died.  She didn't know that the boys had used
265 up most of her estate to try and keep her alive.

339 That is except for Zod. He is here to test his exclamation key. Back in the
340 dark ages of computing, when the words of the new world were being formed, a
341 learned group coined the term TWIT to identify certain users who showed a
342 remarkable lack of intelligence and learning ability. Through the years,
343 different people have stepped forward to claim the title of HEAD TWIT. We
344 all remember DESTROY THE WOLD, and 666, and PEN NAME.
345  
346 This year's winner of HEAD TWIT needs no introduction, as General Zod has
347 gained in sheer volume what he lacks in pure twitliness. His threats and
348 scare tactics are known the board over. The heavy leaning on the ! key, the
349 spelling errors, and mindless drivel, even the lack of sensible grammar has
350 made this year's winner a runaway landslide victor.
351 Congratulations Zod, you have joined the ranks of some pretty non-heady
352 company. You should be proud that your brain-damaged entries on Back Water
353 have done more than gained you the electronic hatred of thousands of users,
354 you have netted an award that many strive for but only a few ever achieve.

368    Kudos to the Zen Master of Bad Grammar, Zod.  May his life be filled with
369 nightmares of {!} being typed by him 1,000,000 million times; and then he
370 discovers he has to type it over again because of a mistake on the 99999
371 {!}.  My mind will always have a place for you (somewhere around the dead
372 letter section) in the world.  It is with the Great Honor of the Ancient
373 Tradition of Twits, Idiots, Imbiceles, and Lobotomized People, that the
374 Awards Committee presents you with a life-like rubber exclamation key
375 that will amuse your enemies and wear your finger to a pulp in 547
376 keystrokes.
377    Again, my Kudos to you (along with some great amusement from your
378 prose).

402 In keeping with the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Louisiana's 
403 mandatory teaching of "creation-science" in the public schools, which gave
404 the doctrine equal status with Darwinian scientific thought, the Louisiana 
405 state senate has passed legislation calling for the mandatory teaching of 
406 evolution in church.
407 The landmark bill calls for all religious services to be accompanied by a
408 bonded secular humanist, who will assist clergymen by periodically interrupting
409 their services with irrefutible scientific evidence that everything they say is
410 bullshit.
411 In addition, services will henceforth be translated into appropriate secular
412 language, as demonstated by "Darwin's Prayer":
413  
414    Our forefather,
415    Who art in the food chain,

429  Forever

517 Why destroy a smile just because it isn't who you thought it was? A smile
518 is a wonderful gift that is easy to give, costs nothing from the material
519 world, and can profit yourself and the receiver many times whatever the 
520 cost involved. A smile for a stranger is a valuable gift, as it reassures
521 each of us, when we are the ststranger  that the world is not a completely
522 cold and alone place. Such a simple thing, such a wonderful thing.

532@   Zit, I already popped you a long long long long long long long long
533@long time ago.  Again, you don't even know how to use the dam*ed BBS
534@functions to look at previous messages.  Go bugger a goat; or maybe
535@that airhead, Ursa...
536@ 
537    My apologies to Lord B., I'm on sabbatical.  My values are
538 screwed up again (for the 8192th time, I think).  Hard to be both
539 a Guru and do everything else.  Hmmm, seems that I could balence myself
540 between all things.  It could be done...(if Leonardo did it, so can I!)
541 I shall return in short time, being a full-fledged Guru & mush-mind.
542  
543    In the mean time, I will always appear and check on the board's
544 progress (not to be confused with Pilgrims or any other religion/cult).
545 If need be I will return prematurely.
546  
547    (Damn) he thought, (I want to sleep more).
548    He roused himself, and stood up in bed.  It was a cold day
549 outside, and it didn't help with his urge to return to the comfortable
550 sheets of his bed; the cold air was biting his skin, waking him like a
551 slap on the face.  Suddenly, he was hungry.  And constipated. (Ugh), he
552 thought, (I need some food.  Go to the john first...).  Walking to te
553 bathroom seemed like eternity, but he was feeling better five minutes
554 later.  The stomach lodged in his gut gave him a not-so-gentle remier
555 that he required protiens to live, as he walked out of the small room.
556 (Food.  Always food.  Feed me...) he thought, as he dressed himself.  His
557 suit from yesterday was soiled, so he put his spare on.  The
558 polyfiber felt good, warm, on his skin.  He was fully awake now, and
559 was checking the equipment for proper operation.  The environsuit responded
560 with a good systems check after 5 seconds.  He then snapped the seals, and
561 stepped outside with crunching sounds beneath his feet.  The first thing
562 he saw was a husk of what was a gravtrans; it was in shards.  Blastmarks
563 covered the little old transport.  (Damnit!) he thought, (the stink'n
564 rogues passed though last night!  I knew I should have had it orbiting!)
565 He quickly punched up the defensive systems, which armed his exterior
566 weapons.

607    A quick scan of the area showed no higher electronics in any active state.
608 (Rogues must have past through last night, nailed my gravtrans, and went
609 on to another sector) he thought.  He was still pissed; the gravtrans would
610 be difficult to replace.  Sigh.  But his defensive systems were picking
611 up a heat source against the background, at body temperature.  Only one
612 source was identified.  (It couldn't be the rogues, or any other wandering
613 group.  It must be another individualist) A few quick adjustments to
614 the external sensory and he suddenly picked up an audio track.  The on-
615 board system identified the source as human, about 175 pounds, carrying
616 gear.  (Confusing) he thought (but interesting...)  He decided to
617 take cover and wait for the arival of the person.  The footsteps were
618 coming closer and closer...he held his finger tight; for if that trigger
619 sensor should think he was pointing, a small portion of hell would be
620 unleashed upon whatever he was pointing to.  (Wait and see, wait and
621 see...)

697  
698 President Ronald Reagan has announced that he does not intend to leave the
699 White House when his term expires at the end of the year. "It's a nice place
700 ," Reagan said. "It's comfortable and Nancy likes it. We kinda got used to it.
701 My favorite chair is here and I have the cutest little garden in back. No, were
702 gonna keep it."
703  
704 Reagan said that whoever replaces him can get a room at the Hilton and charge 
705 it to the government. Reagan would even allow him to use the Oval Office. "But
706 come five o'clock," said the President, "out he goes."
707  
708 The Attorney General's office is examining the legalities involved in allowing 
709 Reagan to retain possession of the nation's first home. When questioned,
710 Attorney General Edwin Meese said, "Off the top of my head, I'd say it sounds
711 right."

718    The 'target' came into view.  It was humanoid, about 2 meters tall,
719 and in parial armor.  (LesSee if I can get a facial...) he cranked the
720 visor display up to 15x.  But when the humanoid turned around, it was
721 wearing a visor too.  (Oh piss and potatoes, it spotted me!)  He was now
722 quickly thinking for areas to run to.  The EEG picked this up and registered
723 panic/fear.  This in turn caused a local land servey and location selection
724 program to find new defensive positions.  He always felt a little startled
725 when his suit could pick up his ideas and feelings before he had time
726 to enter them, but in this case, he welcomed the analysis of the defensive
727 systems. {SHRAK} (OOOUUCH!) a hand maser punctured a tiny little hole into
728 his right upper arm.  He was first feeling scared; now he was angry.  The
729 suit (again) picked this up and re-configured for offensive programs.  He

731 on the 'suit fired, consuming enough energy to power a town for a day.  The
732 visor automatically shut off for 1/10 of a second as his total firepower
733 created a small sun before his eyes.  The next thing he saw was three old
734 city blocks ablaze, just like the napalm he used to tinker with.  He was happy.
735  
736    And then all hell broke loose.  Only emergency power was availible,
737 and the internal environment support was shut down. (Sh*t!  Power is sapped!
738 Need to recharge, now!) and he was fumbling to open the solar panels on
739 the back, fighting the weight of the 'dead' suit around him, trying not
740 to use all of the emergency reserves he had left.  He started to breathe
741 harder and harder as the carbon dioxide replaced his good air.  (Oh no, the
742 seals are jammed!  And there's not enough power to unlock them all!)

753 Sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but if anyone here actually reads "Superman"
754 (The birthplace, as far as I can tell,  of the character "General Zod") then 
755 they will notice that, after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Zod and the rest of
756 the Phantom Zone prisoners no longer    exist, except in the pocket Universe of
757 the Time Trapper, which is going to be  eliminated shortly anyhow.
758 Just thought I'd try to be contructive  in my first venture on Backwater.
759 Does this board allow new users to write stories?  Someone told me that you did
760 but also said that only professional    writers are appreciated and that the

770 Shard,  By all means, write! That's what this board is here for. It is
771 here for you to express yourself! Most writer's here are amatures and not
772 professional. While occasionally someone raises a voice against a new
773 writer, it is generally some twit who can't write themself and figures that
774 no one else should either. 
775 P.S. I have very few rules here, but there are a couple that Iadhere to.
776 This is expressed in the opening 20 lines of each disk. The first is no
777 obscenity, some people are offended by it. I'm not, but I don't want to 
778 loose good users for something that can be easily avoided.
779 The other rule is threats against others or passing information that does
780 not belong on a public system. These types of messages are generally removed,
781 and if the user persists their account is revolked. 
782 Beyond these simple rules, you are free to enter what you like, stories,
783 debates, rants, raves, you name it.
784 P.P.S. remember when this disk gets full it is moved to DB, and a new
785 one placed here, so this disk will magically empty out periotica|ly.

887 A bar owner with a sense of co}pacsion decided to open a lounge for 
888 deaf-mutes. In the beginning, the barkeeper designated simple hand 
889 signals for different drinks. One finger raised in the air  meant a 
890 beer, two fingers for whiskey, and three fingers for wine.
891  
892 In a short time, he had a booming business, so he decided to hire 
893 another man to serve drinks. When the new bartender arrived, the owner 
894 explained the signal system, but warned him NOT to serve more than three 
895 drinks to a person.

898 a night off. However, when the happy hour crowd started flooding the 
899 lounge, thu bardender was putting up drinks as fast as he could. Pretty 
900 soon the people at the bar were raising four and five fingers and waving 
901 both hands.
902     
903 Frustrated and flustered, the new man called his boss and explained the 
904 problum gyth everyone waving their hands in the air.
905      
906 The bar owner asked over the phone, "Did you serve them more than three 
907 drinks a piece?"

909 "I probably did. They've been ordering so fast, I couldn't keep count..."

936    Hello, folks, it feels good to be back.  'Just scanned the board 'n found
937 it to be in good shape.  But where is Lord Beaker?
938  
939    To the newer users, I am Hagbard Celine, soon-to-be Guru.  Y have just
940 returned from sabbatical, and my values are bent into a straight line.  We
941 (the population of Backwater) were infested with Zits (oops) Zods who
942 would fester messages everywhere.  But Zod has left for new grounds to
943 conquer (cp) (maybe he's at the playground...)

945    A blip appeared on the HUD of his visor.  A tiny one.  It meant that
946 the suit was trying to recharge.  He struggled with it more, and got a
947 single panel open off of his back.  The blip turnud i~to a short bar.
948 (This is going to be slow.  Oh well.  At least the scavenger got what it
949 deserved.  Damn he, she, or whatever it was.  Why did it fire?) and he
950 continued to ponder these thoughts, standing for several hours and
951 beco}ing0tired.  At the end of the fourth hour, there was enough power
952 for him to start the autoarticulators for his arms up.  Promptly opening
953 the other three panels, the suit began a full recharge.  He was walking
954 in ten minutes, running in two, qnd cruising in one.  Thirty minutes 
955 after that, he was at his 'home', a concrete/carbonplas geodestic dome
956 buried half under the ground.  When inside, his stomach gave him another
957 reminder about his empty food locker, but he was concer~ed with the
958 tiny maser hole in his arm (Antibiotics will take care of that, and the
959 self-repair programs will seal over the hole.  'Just need to get some
960 fussion material) he thought as he tossed an empty beer can into a port
961 on the ani}atet suit's hip.  (That should power it, along with the
962 recharged fuel cells.)  He watched, facinated, as his 'suirepaired
963 itself at the workshop.  He began to ponder again, about this 'skin'
964 that he depended upon.  It protects him, serves xim,0it almost was
965 him - Holistic Computers usually picked up the personallity of their
966 owners - but it was errie, watching a dead object act alive, as if
967 he himself were inside.  It troubled him, and he always tried to come
968 to terms wydh id.  (Ouch!  Need to get some food.  NOW.)  as his stomach
969 gave a third jolting at dinnertime.  He climbed in, re-did the seals,
970 and went outside.

985 I~ the olden days of backwater one, it was almost as great an honor to 
986 be last as it was to be first.  That was the days of Pam and company
987 I remember adventures on a chip, and many before that.  I was always

992 begin again.0 I {now I would get out my trusty walking stick and my
