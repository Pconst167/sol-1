47    "It's just some putzy little ball of ice!" Actually, Amphyrian was a ball of rock covered with ice. It was about
48 2/3 the size of earth's moon and orbited its primary (Rigel) at a distance of seven light weeks. The computer
49 calculated its orbital period at somewhere around 370,000 years. James' ship had popped out of nullspace three
50 planetary diameters away. "Look at this!" James said. "If it ever HAD an atmosphere (which I doubt) it's frozen on the
51 ground. There's nothing here." He turned and fixed her with an accusatory glare. "If you're jerking me
52 around..."
53    Tariya had had quite enough out of him. "Take your sensors," she said, slowly, as if talking to a child, "and focus
54 them on the north pole. Just like the computer said."
55    James fiddled with the controls for a minute. then he sat back with an exclamation. "I don't believe it."
56    Located exactly at the north pole was a dome of air twenty miles across. The sensors showed it was perfectly
57 breathable and heated to room temperature. What was keeping the air from freezing or escaping was another matter. At
58 the bottom of the computer screen were the words "I TOLD YOU SO." Tariya's expression said exactly the same
59 thing.
60    James hated to be wrong. He hated even more to make a fool of himself. "So something's there. I hope you don't
61 expect me to apologize."
62    "The thought never crossed my mind. Like I said, it's a focal point for some very powerful mystic forces. It
63 doesn't pay to make such things easily accessable."
64    "Even though it's an open secret."
65    "Well, it's not really that well known. I was as surprised as you that the computer knew about it. Not that I would
66 have admitted that, of course."
67    "Of course. Hmm. This is a used ship. Maybe its previous owner was Merlin."
68    "Who?"
69    "Never mind." He adjusted the life scanners. "I can't find anybody down there. Who runs the place?"
70    "The Crystal Palace is 'run' by whoever's using it at the time. Otherwise, it's unattended. Nobody's there right
71 now or the scanners would have shown nothing and you would never have believed me. When in use the whole area places
72 itself outside this universe."
73    "That's not very comforting." James commented as he programmed in a normal space landing.
74    Tariya put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "There's nothing to worry about. I can handle it."
75    "You're sure about that?"
76    "Trust me."
77    James mumbled something about famous last words as the ship lowered itself towards the planet's
78 surface.

90 Several days later, we were stymied.
91 We had one clear advantage over other pioneers- a working model.  That still
92 didn't mean that all the work was done for us.  Our largest problem was that
93 we had discovered no way to probe the nonexistant interior of the grey IC.
94 At least, we assumed it was an IC.
95 "Only one thing I can think of to do," Stan said after a particularly long,
96 tiring session with the grey thing, "and that's installing it into a Passkey
97 and observing effects.  Entirely too dangerous, of course.  You might end up
98 anywhere at all- nearby star, distant planet, center of a hypermass-"
99 All of those things were hazards to extradimensional navigation.  A standard
100 traveldoor on Sirius that led to, say, Terra required fifteen billion
101 calculations per second to keep it pinpointed to the correct destination;
102 comets, suns, even the rotation of the connected planets had to be taken into
103 consideration.
104 "...Well, it's getting late.  We'll start again tomorrow, eh?"  I nodded, and
105 Stan let himself out.
106 Install it into a Passkey...
107 Slowly I arose.  I'll do it.  Stan had a family, I rationalized, and couldn't
108 possibly be called on to take the risk.  Yet nothing else could be done.  If
109 I could only collect data, we could have some major insights on how the thinng
110 worked.
111 I wrote a long letter to Stan, detailing what I was about to do, and left it
112 on the workbench where he would find it the next morning.  I took th
113 stabilizer circuit and installed it into my Passkey, triple-checking all
114 of my work.  Next I gathered a standard-issue survival pack, food and water for
115 two weeks, a repair kit, spare parts, and Stan's vesloc.  I transferred credit
116 to Stan's account to pay for it, and added a PS to my letter.
117 Finally, all was prepared.  I looked about my home and said farewell, then
118 pressed the contact on the Passkey.
119 I told the vesloc to record all the spatial phenomena in the immediate vicinity,
120 then stepped through the shimmering circle of light.

128     The door to Innisfal opened.  It opened slowly (but not at all
129 dramatically, as there was no breeze) to reveal the wimp trying to
130 get it opened.  Nobody noticed his struggle.
131     He was a simple man.  About 5'9", 127 lbs, with reddish-blond
132 hair, a red beard, and glasses (you know the kind, with the bottoms
133 of Coke bottles for lenses).  If anyone had looked at him, they would
134 have seen the streaks of mud left over from tripping over a root to the
135 "stupid" tree.  (He could have sworn that the tree tripped him on
136 purpose.)
137     As he was struggling to close the door, he got slammed between it
138 and the wall as a group of rowdy adventures came stomping in for some
139 romping good stories and beaucoup barrels of beer.  He peeled himself
140 off of the wall and sat at a table in the middle of the room, all by
141 himself.
142     Twenty minutes later, the innkeeper noticed him.  A simple glass of
143 milk was ordered, along with the 'soup du jour'.  Once delivered, it was
144 all consumed quickily (but rather sloppily), and the chin was dabbed
145 by the old shirtsleeve.
146     He considered his next move.  "Shall I go on to deliver my message
147 to the council of wizards, or shall I say *#@^&% it and go to sleep?"
148 He didn't like the fact that he had been chosen to deliver the most
149 important message that the Council would ever receive.  In fact, he
150 quite resented the delegation, and was reminded of a leper that he read
151 about that kept finding himself in another world, where his white-gold
152 wedding band (from his estranged wife) was The Power to end all powers.
153     "Thomas was stupid for doing all that against his will."  He mummbled
154 some simple anglo-saxon curse, laid his head in the bowl in front of him,
155 and went to sleep.

162     No one seemed to notice the sausage shaped form of translucent jade ware
163 it floated a few inches below the top of the scared oaken table.  Dreamtoucher
164 knew of course of its preasence.  Without person's aid he might have remained
165 forever stranded in a parched land.
166      Snowrunner lay full length but upright on the planked floor, her muzzle
167 resting on front paws, eyes open, alert, playful.  The rabbet twitched
168 nerviosly, a wary eye cast in her direction.  From time to time she would jurk
169 her head upright, first in one direction, than another, as if to give playful
170 chaise.
171      #Stop that!# The ageless elf admonished her.  #He is NOT lunch.#
172      #Not lunch indeed# was Zypher's projected thought.
173      A smal sound escaped Snowrunner's closed mouth as she slumped her head
174 lower on her forpaws in mock dejection.
175      Dreamtoucher seated himself and reached out to touch the rabbit's forehead
176 .  Around them the Inn's good fealings went on, its many fascinating con-
177 versations, some whispered, some spoken aloud, undisturbed by thair entrance.

183 Krakus looked toward the slow moving ocean, and it seemed almost to bow to him.
184 He had awlays admired the sea, and figured it was about time it admired him.
185 A shallow voice came into existance.
186 "Krakus?", it asked.
187 Disturbed from his peace, his response was rasped.
188 "#$%&$% WHAT?!?" he yelled with all his lungs.
189 It was Rasoi, the captive he had taken, and had gradually taken a nice 
190 liking to, also....
191 Attractive was her body, with silky skin, and nice figure.
192 Rasoi looked depressed to this rudeness.
193 "What's wrong, Krakus?"she asked, still trying to be somber and mellow,
194 as not to bring about more harsh feelings.
195 "I-  I- I feel dizzy...." And at that, fainted off to the subconscious...
196 Rasoi went back to the land rover, and fetched two larger creatures...one named
197 Po and the other, Mia.
198 The two husky, brown furred Gladinoids dragged him back into the tiny, cramped
199 space vehicle, and proceeded back to

203 "Yes Sir, we do.... loud & clear."

205 She smiled, and looked toward
206 the Gladinoids, who stayed expressionless. 'oh well' she thought....
207 "M-Hmm-- I Mean YES SIR!" she hastily stated...
208 this break in the silence was the only thing that brought the huge Gladinoids' 
209 attention... They growled.
210 "-Click- What the H*** are you doing?!? Where's Captain Jacob?!? -Click-" the

332 Someone let Destroyer on the loose... I am amused at the controversial escapades
333 of that not-too-distant time.It appears that Destroyer stumbled upon an excel-
334 lent method of having his works praised... first do something controversial,
335 have all those nitpickers nit it to death, and then the brave shall rise to the
336 occassion and give it hearty praise to time immemorial. This is not a comment
337 as to the quality of work whatsoever, it's just amusing that one has to be put

343 The Captain wiped his blood-stained sword with a determined pull through his
344 torn pants. At his feet lay two creatures, each with a bloody gash at their
345 throats. Their slimy green exteriors reddened the dark blood which flowed from
346 their necks, the stench was becoming almost unbearable.
347 He wiped his brow, sword still in hand, and then examined the fine Selurian
348 blade for any damage. Satisfied, he placed the glittering length of steel into
349 his jewel-encrusted sheath.
350 He looked back at the glimmering shaft of light in the distance. He had barely
351 made it a hundred yards before these
352 two guarians had accosted him. Fortunately, his sword was quick and his feet
353 nimble; even though the attack was unexpectedly soon, he knew, upon venturing
354 into this cave, that danger would lurk nearby.
355 He paused, took in a breath of air, ignoring the increasingly distasteful
356 smell from the bodies at his feet, and continued on into the tunnel. He knew 
357 that this was a miniscule test of his skill, compared to what lay ahead. But 
358 still, he had promised her ladyship, and would go on until the deed was finished
359 ...  or until he was.

380 The cold October air skittered leaves about the feet of the robed traveller
381 as he pushed open the doors of the Inn. Dark eyes surveyed the room from
382 beneath a worn and sodden hood.
383 I've been moving in faster circles lately, the Poet mused, but circles all
384 the same. Noticing that his favorite table was being used for a pillow by a
385 rather unpreposessing young man, the Mad One quietly circled in the shadows
386 at the fringes of the room, scanning for familiar faces. There was a large
387 gentleman of ursine mein regaling those at nearby tables with a tale of gory
388 daring-do, and several among his audience seemed somewhaat familiar. That's
389 the problem with all of this reality-hopping, he thought, eventually everyone
390 the problem with all of this reality-hopping, he thought, eventually
391 everyone just looks like someone you think you know...
392 everyone looks a little familiar...
393 There was one person in the Inn the Poet was sure he knew, though. Turning
394 his mind and eyes from the other patrons of the evening, he stepped up to the
395 bar.
396 "Innkeeper, I've had a long journey and I'm tired. I'd like you to send
397 seven ales back to me in the bath. Oh, and if a rather crazed looking
398 gentleman by the name of Post comes asking about me, I haven't been here in
399 months."
400 So saying, the poet laid a large multicolored gem in the Innkeeper's palm
401 and slid back to the marbled ecstacy of the Bath.

422    K.I.S. Net is in great need of some
423 writters. I know the writters from 
424 TANIS have to be hangin' about some-
425 where, and I guess this is one of the
426 most likely places.
427    There are many calls comming in to
428 K.I.S. Net, but no one is leaving any
429 material. They just log on, look around
430 a bit, and log off. What is needed is
431 some good story writters.

434 If the quality of the material is exemplified by the above message, I'm not
435 surprised there are no stories going.  "writters", indeed!

449   The cold blue steel of his laser canon reflected the dim light from above.
450 His prey was almost in range. Don't fire until you see their bloodshot eyes
451 Hartleeb remembered. Then all at once, there he was. Lumbering along like he
452 ruled the world, one hand on a jewel encrusted sheath, the other hand busy
453 while several of its fingers were stuck in the long barrel of a gun. His
454 lumbering was not aided by the fact that one foot was firmly implanted in
455 his mouth. The hopping motion made the site almost too funny to blow away,
456 but blow away he must. Into range, just a few seconds more. Hartleeb's
457 finger tensed on the hair-trigger of his death device. With a twitch, an amber
458 field erupted from the mouth of the cave, atomizing everything in its path.
459 As the smoke cleared, and Hartleeb surveyed the scene before him, a metalic
460 voice rang out in the valley, from no apparent source.
461 HARTLEEB ONE, THE BEAR ZERO. THIS CONCLUDES TONIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENT. PLEASE
462 TUNE IN NEXT WEEK FOR ANOTHER EXCITING EPISODE OF MUTUAL OF OMAHA'S WILD

480      "H-hello, Dreamtoucher?"
481      I wasn't used to this "type of "mind communication.", and it was very
482 discomfortin
483 :::::=====(Maikey, delete the above, ok?? I'll start over.
484 :::::=====:::::=====
485      "H-hello?"
486      Such a strange way to communicate!  My mind was "speaking" in my own 
487 rabbit tongue, and yet (according to Dreamtoucher) he heard straight English
488 in HIS mind.  I only spoke for a short while when last we met, and I still 
489 haven't really gotten used to it,.
490      I paused, looking over at Snowrunner, who was eyeing ME as well 
491 in a hungry /playful sort of way.  Nerve-wracking.
492      "So Dreamtoucher.....where have you been since last we met?  I eagerly
493 await you to tell me, for I love the tales you spin of your homeworld, and 
494 your grand forests of old.  So speak...er..."think", friend Elven Mystic."
495      Dreamtoucher touched my forhead, and a tingle ran up my back.  I felt
496 strong magics surrounding both Dreamtoucher, Snowrunner, and some other
497 presence.  I guessed that it was just the last of the "storm" befuddling my
498 senses, but I could swear that there was someone else sin the air near the pair.

501 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
502 
503 ...As Hartleeb notched his gun with his hardened nail, he mused that there was
504 nothing that could possible touch him and his gun. Sure, a volley had been
505 fired... two of his guardians had been killed. But it was he who had the last
506 laugh.
507 
508 He dug the mark deeply into the butt of his gun. He cared not that he had nearly
509 DESTROYED the finish on it. The notches were the important thing. The beauty
510 of the kill overroad the beauty of the fine craftsmanship which had been so
511 delicately labored over by now-unknown craftsmen.
512 
513 He sheathed his weapon and sauntered janutily toward the darkness from whence
514 he had come, whistling a happy tune.
515 
516 Without sound or warning, his shrill whistle abrubtly haulted. There was
517 deafening silence in the darkness of the tunnel for just a moment. Then the
518 raspy breath of fear searing from his nostrils. The whites of his eyes could be
519 seen in the darkness.
520 
521 A stern voice whispered in the back of his ear. He felt the slight push of a
522 sharpened blade at his back. The strong hand covered his mouth completely.
523 
524 "Those who use only one sense, often lose all of them."
525 
526 His clouded mind could not understand.
527 
528 "Your eyes saw my image, which was transferred to the tunnel through my Epyxian
529 image projector. It is one of my many defense mechanisms.
530 
531 You see, I am never quite where I seem to be. When you fire at a target, you
532 best be sure you hit it. And kill for good."
533 
534 Hartleeb's eyes could only widen further, if that were even possible. No sound
535 came from his face save his strident breathing. The breath of fear. And death.
536 
537 And now, you see sir, I shall show you how to KILL, and smell, and touch, and
538 hear the stink of death. That fancy gun tries to explode the body at a safe
539 distance.  You see, killing is a personal deed. You miss the mark when you work
540 at a distance."
541 
542 Hartleeb's eyes widened even further, seemingly creating new openings in his
543 forehead. The light eminating from his eyes created a warm aura around his head
544 in the gloomy darkness in the tunnel.
545 
546 The blade plunged even deeper, reaching for the heart. Hidden inside the 
547 clothing of flesh and blood was a palpitating organ, which objected to the
548 sharpness that inhibited its movements.
549 
550 So it stopped. And Hartleeb's body slowly relaxed, and fell in a heap into the
551 ground.
552 
553 The Bear withdrew his sword, wiping it carefully on Hartleeb's jacket. No use
554 to mess up my clothes with HIS blood, he thought. Sheathing the sword, he
555 clutched the misused gun. Shrugging, and emitting a sound something like the
556 combination of a growl and a giggle, he  crushed it in his hands, and threw it
557 to the ground.
558 
559 But the Bear did not laugh. He simply shook his head and smiled sadly.
560 
561 "One does not laugh at death," he said softly. "And one should never misjudge
562 the abilities of ones enemies. Pride can be a deadly companion."
563 
564 He nudged the lifeless body with his well-worn boot, and continued on into the
565 tunnel....
566 
567 
568 0000000000000000000000000 THE BEAR 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
569 		He and She
570 I'm sure that you can imagine
571 It's as simple as can be
572 The place is rather private
573 The players he and she
574 
575 She whispered "Will it hurt?"
576 "Of course not" he replied
577 It's just a simple process
578 lay back and close your eyes
579 
580 She says "I'm rather frightened"
581 I've never done it before
582 He wanted to continue
583 It won't hurt much more
584 
585 It's getting rather painful
586 Tears came to her eyes
587 It's hurting something awful
588 
589 Now calm yourself, my darling
590 This feeling unfolds your sin
591 Now open lightly, so I can let more in
592 
593 Suddenly with a jump
594 She gave a little shout
595 Now it's all over, he pulled it out
596 
597 Now as you read carefully
598 A dentist you will find
599 It's not what you were thinking
600 It's just your dirty mind
