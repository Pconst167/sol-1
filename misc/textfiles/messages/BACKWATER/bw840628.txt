20 DO YOU HAVE A SANYO MBC-55X? DO YOU HAVE A SERIAL RS232 PORT IN IT?
21 IF YOU ANSWERED YES TO BOTH OF THESE QUESTIONS, THEN YOU MAY HAVE
22 A SERIOUS PROBLEM. IF YOUR SERIAL CARD DOES NOT HAVE A INTEL 8251A
23 USART ON IT ('80 MASK) THEN YOU WILL EXPERIENCE INTERMITENT PROBLEMS
24 IF IT HAS SOME OTHER BRAND OF USART IN IT, SUCH AS NEC, AMD, MITSUBISHI,
25 OR INTEL '77 MASK. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE RIBBON CABLE GOING FROM THE
26 MOTHER BOARD TO THE SERIAL CARD PICKS UP ALL KINDS OF RF THAT IS FLOATING
27 AROUND INSIDE THE SANYO, THIS ADDED TO THE LACK OF ANY REAL LOAD AT 
28 THE END OF THE CABLE (THE 8251 DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY REAL LOAD) WHICH
29 INDUCES RINGING IN THE CABLE, AND YOU HAVE ALL THE MAKINGS FOR A REAL
30 PROBLEM. HOW DO YOU SOLVE THIS YOU SAY? WELL, THERE ARE TWO SOLUTIONS.
31 IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AN INTEL 8251A '80 MASK PART IN THERE,
32 THERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE, THEN GO
33 GET YOURSELF SOME TIN FOIL AND WRAP IT AROUND THE RIBBON CABLE. THEN
34 WRAP THE TINFOIL WITH SOME TAPE (DON'T WANT TO SHORT OUT EVERYTHING 
35 INSIDE YOUR SANYO!) THIS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF ANY PROBLEMS YOU WILL
36 ENCOUNTER IN YOUR SANYO SERIAL INTERFACE (HARDWARE WISE).
37 NOW OF COURSE IF YOU DO HAVE A SANYO AND A SERIAL INTERFACE CARD, YOU
38 WILL WANT A COMUNICATIONS PROGRAM FOR IT. AND OF COURSE YOU WILL WANT
39 THE BEST YOUR MONEY CAN BUY <AHEM> COPYLINK BY U.S. DIGITAL. ASK YOUR
40 SANYO DEALER, OR CALL U.S. DIGITAL AT (503) 654-0668. PRICE IS $99.95
41 ALSO, IF YOU HAVE A SANYO MBC-55X, YOU ARE AWARE OF THE INTENSE LACK OF
42 SOFTWARE AVAILABLE FOR IT. SO... YOU MIGHT WANT CONSIDER GETTING THE
43 CPeMULATOR PROGRAM FROM U.S. DIGITAL AS WELL (ALSO $99.95) THE CPeMULATOR
44 ALLOWS YOU RUN CP/M-80 PROGRAMS ON YOU SANYO. IT EMULATES A CP/M-80 
45 COMPUTER WITH A ADM-3A TYPE TERMINAL. (THIS INCLUDES THE KAYPRO, MORROW,
46 SANYO MBC-1XXX, OSBORNE, OTTRONA, AND A HOST OF OTHERS) SOON TO BE 
47 AVAILABLE FOR THE IBM AND ITS LOOKALIKES (IN ABOUT 3-4 WEEKS). INCLUDED
48 WITH THE CPeMULATOR IS A 'READCPM' PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO READ
49 KAYPRO DISKS AND AND COPY THEM ONTO YOUR MSDOS DISK SO YOU CAN RUN THEM
50 WITH THE CPeMULATOR.

101 The apprentice was busily packing their clothes and equipment, while
102 his master readied the spell that would transport them. The apprentice was 
103 checking and re-checking as he packed. He did not wish to overlook anything, for
104 if he did his master would send him back to fetch it.
105 As this was to be his first wizard's convention, he did not want to miss
106 anything! 
107 At last everything was ready. The spell was cast....
108 They seemed to be suspended in a three-dimensional whirlpool of color.
109 The apprentice could not feel his body. He was aware of his own existence and he
110 could somehow sense his master but that was all. At first he thought they had

115 Oklahoma City (UPI) The Rev. Jerry Falwell accepted a 5.7 
116 million dollar donation today from the McKane organization in 
117 one of the most lavish ceremonies ever held in this city. An 
118 estimated crowd of two million formed the worlds largest 
119 prayer circle to pray for the work of Mr. McKane and his 
120 organization. The ceremony came to a dramatic conclusion as 
121 the clouds parted during Kate Jacksons' stirring rendition of 
122 "God Show Me the Light" to cast a single ray of heavenly light 
123 upon Mr. McKane.
124 
125 The Rev. Falwell characterized the event as a miricle. Sceptics
126 claim that the large donation and extravagant spiritual display
127 was orchestrated to pressure President Reagan to participate
128 in the McKane organizations' "rent a miricle" promotion. 
129 
130 Informed sources within the Falwell organization deny these 
131 charges. They insist moral majority support for Mr. McKane is 
132 purely founded on love of goodness and righteousness. Their 
133 support for the McKane organization will only be superceded by 
134 their spiritual mission to track down and destroy Demien II.

176 "Well Bard", started L'homme, "no one seems interested in going around in
177  car anymore. Why should they when there are real live "space" ships nearby?
178  Maybe if you send me back to Tek, I can pick up where I left off. And when
179  I get back, maybe I can get together a band of people and try to find out
180  what's behind the sudden rise in activity coming from the McKane Organization.
181  We had such plans...such plans to totally rid the world of this blight known
182  as Leroy McKane. He has caused the governments of the world nothing but
183  trouble. This latest con is merely a thinly guised plot to usurp power from
184  the established organized religions, and get a hook into a position that
185  the church hasn't ever been able to get, the presidency. I can see it now...
186  The next election will be won by the candidate the McKane organization has
187  offically backed. Promises will be made in the lust for power that will
188  doom the free democratic society as we know it. It is all so clear! Can't
189  those fools see what is happening? The Moral Majority is nothing compared
190  to the power this circle of prayer Leroy McKane is trying to push. Yes...
191  Send me back...quickly!!!
192  L'homme seated him self in his Mustange, and as the Bard turned some dials
193  on his instruments, L'homme looked back at the Inn for the last time...
194  "Maybe I will come back someday, but not before I rid the cosmos of LEROY
195  MCKANE!!!"
196  With that final yell...L'hommes car becomes but a shimmering memory to the
197  Inn... As Bard had instructed earlier, L'homme began to accelerate when the
198  area outside the car began to change... "Set it up to the speed limit you
199  were going before you saw that mysterious mazda almost two months ago, and
200  you will find yourself on the freeway you call "Sunset"...heading for a
201  place you call "tek"...
202  As the lights began to change, and the sound of the car grew, L'homme 
203  started to recognize his surroundings... "It was true!" He was heading
204  past the 217 interchange! And his car clock...it was reading the same
205  day it had read when the crazy Mazda interrupted his drive out to Tek.
206  "Thank you Bard", said L'homme to himself. "You have now given me the
207   means to end this crusade of a million souls...this circle of prayer
208   that threatens the masses...the diabolical plot put forth by the McKane
209   Organization..."
210  And as he drove...he began to derive his own plot...his own plan...Leroy

241 Now, on to more religious aspects! First of all the guru of bliss needs to

244 that this is a Deemocratic Society that we live in and that an integral part
245 of this is Freedom of SPEECH. It is people like you that create oppressive
246 societies like those described in '1984'(I hope someone out there has some
247 kind of literary knowledge and can understand what I am saying. But I doubt
248 it very much). Lord morby, earl of TWITS is still away(Thank God for that!)

318 UP AT THE SOMEHOW FAMILLIAR STRANGER STANDING BEFORE HIM. BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK,
319 THOUGHTS ENTERED HIS MIND, AND HIS INITIAL UNEASINESS WAS QUELLED, AND HIS INNER

328         The rivers of light, waxing and waning in and endless procession 
329 of intensity and hue, streaming onward to some distant point it would never
330 reach. Ceaselessly filaments of the etheral incandesence sought their
331 freedom only to perish far short of their goal.
332 Sublimating into the soft recesses of infinite space, their energy spent.
333 Such purpose, such futility, so often had he seen this cycle. So few had
334 suceeded in finding the fulcrum, the point of balance in this world 
335 of eccentric spheres. Yet it had been that drive for equanimity that had 
336 brought him here so many months ago. 
337 His life until then had been Of the Sea and By the Sea. And he had 
338 paid dearly for the lessons it had provided both in physical and 
339 spiritual renumeration. Why then had he come to this barren plateau
340 perched on the side of this mute mountain ? and had gone no further ? 
341 Proding the fire with a twig he absently reached for his pocket, 
342 producing a small swatch of brown satin, weathered and stained. 
343 He mused to himself # To whom do you belong ? #
344  
345 Raising his eyes to the heavens he could see the fading curtains of 
346 parading light # Dawn approaches # he thought. Reaching for his rowan he
347 stood upright. Bracing himself with the staff he regarded the rivers 
348 course in the fading starlight. # Will I continue my quest for the headwaters
349 or shall I return #          
350      # I will let the signs of tomorrow decide #

354 Cistop Mikey:Thanks anyway, do you have any idea oof where I can get info on 
355 just WHAT the heck CP/M programs want of CP/M? I can write the puppy if I can find 
356 this stuff out. There exists a CPP/M 80 emulater for the z8000 but it is NOT public
357 domain and I am going to market this beast. The last time I saw Aaron he said that he was taking a trip someplace,
358 the Bit Bucket logs say that his last session was the 10th of june. Sorry to be the berrer(sp) of bad tidings but thats 
359 how it goes.
360 Alex:can you call friday night at 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. time slot?
361 
362 Leonard:do you perchance have a copy of an AD&D players handbook? It seems I've just
363 joined a campaign and havve no idea of what the heck is going on!!!
364 L'homme Sans Parity:What are you wondering about?
365 Nothing more from the "unknown one" hummm, makes it REAL hard.
366 The Man in Gray-much more sober now.

369 ALEX: right now, anytime the weekend of the 6th-8th is acceptable to me.
370 So far it looks like it's good for all.  I'm not sure if MiG still has my
371 number, but L'homme does, and I access Le Nerd, and CBBS/PCS, so
372 somehow/somewhere a message will get to me.
373 L'homme: what are you doing writing that drivel when you could be enlightening
374 us with the sort of wit, charm, and intelligence that J C & Sushine is?
375 You should be ashamed of yourself!

378     The piper was sleeping soundly, the noises from the inn's common room not
379 even penetrating the outer layers of his sleep.  He lay on his side, knees
380 slightly bend and back curved.  An observer, had one been present, would see
381 his body slumbering close the door and pass on.
382      Only a few observers could have seen what happened next.  Anyone would
383 have seen the slight jump or twich he made, but only the few would have seen
384 the slight mist that seemed to rise from his body.  The few endowed with this
385 visual acuity would have seen this mist pour from the piper's body and coalesce
386 in a cloud above him.  The form and shape of this cloud vaguely resembled the
387 piper himself.  As it slowly moved toward the ceiling of the room, a thin cord
388 seemed to strech from the navel of the piper-shaped cloud to the recumbent 
389 form of the sleeping piper.  Suddenly, with a rush, the cloud disappeared,
390 leaving only the silvery line to the piper's navel, thinning to invisibility.
391 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

394 This is a fun place to be.  I will be back with....
395 Thanks to all of you for showing me that my kind of insanity does exist.
396 Rex.

398 Mig: Yes, I have a copy, but be warned! If you LOSE it or DAMAGE it ......
399 On a lighter subject, I thought that CP/M for the Z8000 was available?
400 You'd still have to write a bios but ...
401 Finally, how would you feel about building a "kit" for one of
402 my roommates? We could get the docs first (I think) if you want to
403 know what you're getting into. Basic "kit" consists of PC board & parts list!
404 Board is etched & drilled, but I've heard rumors too the effect that the
405 documentation sucks!

407 The car faded out leaving most of bard's equipment behind. He quickly 
408 stowed it in his pack.
409 Whistling, he set off for the apprentice's dwelling. When he arrived he
410 found a note tacked to the door. 
411 Bard: My master and I are off to Wizardcon 37. Until we
412 return, wouldst thou keep an eye on the Inn?
413 I wish I did not have to go for I feel the approach of the old
414 rowan staff. Watch for its bearer!
415 Eric of the House of Camber
416 
417 He had no sooner finished reading the note than it disappeared. 
418 "I'll keep watch by the bridge, my friend" he told the empty air. He then 
419 turned and began the walk back to the bridge.
420 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
421 As he sat on the bank near the bridge, the bard began to sing.
422 It was an old song, he'd first heard several hundred years in the future (sorry,
423 English grammar isn't suited to this sort of thing!).
424 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
425 Mary O'Meara (words: Poul Anderson, music: Anne Passovoy)
426 Mary O'Meara, the stars and the dewfall
427 Haved covered your hilltop with light.
428 The wind in the lilies that blossom around you
429 Goes bearing your name from the height;
430 My girl, you are all of the night.
431 
432 A ship out of shadow bears homeward by starlight,
433 By stars, and the loom of your hill;
434 A hand at a brow is uplifted in peering,
435 Saluting and shaking with chill;
436 My girl, are you waiting there still?
437 
438 I'll sing you a song about Mary O'Meara,
439 With stars like a crown in her hair,
440 Sing of her memory ranging before me
441 Wherever the way that I fare,
442 My joy is to know she is there.
443 
444 The song shall ride home on the surf of the starlight,
445 And leap to the shores of the sky,
446 Take wing on the wind, and the odor of lilies,
447 And Mary O'Meara-ward fly,
448 And whisper your name where you lie.
449 
450 So softly you hear it now, Mary O'Meara,
451 But soon it rings joyful and clear,
452 And soon, in the shadow and dew of your hilltop,
453 A star-guided footfall rings near,
454 My only beloved, I'm here.
455 
456 Sleep soft once again if you wake in your darkness,
457 Sleep knowing you are my delight.
458 As long as the stars wheel the years down the heavens,
459 As long as the lilies bloom white,
460 My darling, I kiss you goodnight.
461 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
462 Bard wished Pam was there, she, d, & the apprentice knew more than
463 he about the "staff-bearer". Glancing downstream, he thought he could see a 
464 spark of light.... a campfire?

484 :***********************************************************:
485 Dear Mr. McKane:
486 
487 I just wanted to thank you for your "rent a miricle" program. I
488 can't thank you enough for what it has done for me.
489 
490 Only last month I was almost certain to be indicted for eleven 
491 counts of arson, drug smuggling, and murder. Because of your 
492 wonderful program I am a free man.
493 
494 I'm embarassed to admit it, Mr. McKane, but until I tried your 
495 program I didn't believe in miricles. You sure straightened me
496 on that score.
497 
498 Two hours before my court appearance the judge fell off a 
499 thirty story building, the prosecuting attorney was run over 
500 by a train, and the arresting officer was accidentially blown 
501 up by a bomb. There was no choice but to set me free.
502 
503 There's no way all these things could be coincidence...they 
504 could only be the miricle I paid you the $1,750,000 for. Thank 
505 you again, Mr. McKane, for your wonderful program and may God
506 bless your good works.
507 
508                       Jack (Butcher Boy) Polanski
