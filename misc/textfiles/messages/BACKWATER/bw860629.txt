32  probably because it isn't drowned out by your lawn-mower engine in the

39 an incredible sense of humor they both seem to possess.  Let us all rally
40 behind her as the shining fine example of administrative competence she
41 OBVIOUSLY demonstrates.  Of course, If she was a man she wouldn't have had
42 the chance to show us all how the best
43 woman for a job is a female.

45 MIKEY: Assembler source would be appreciated. For that matter, I'd *really*
46 like a copy of the source to the ROMS in this beast. That way I can
47  borrow' routines & save valuable RAM.
48 see you at the meeting!

52 Leonard: Unfortunatly, I don't have the source to those ROMS. I don't have
53 source to anything close. The best I have is the listing you have. I don't
54 know if Joe has anything close either. He might have the source to the
55 "house" PROMs, which were the ones used for developement, and is basicly
56 the listing you have. Either way, I'll bring you two disks Thr, one with
57 the assembler, and one with the latest utilities, which you can do with
58 as you please.

69 Mikey, there is a reason why the line doesn't answer...  I'm not there.
70 for the longest time (mmm, about four weeks) I've been whisked off to some
71 soul satisfying retreat.  And I took all the hardware with me.  Ha!  Who
72 says you can't take it with you?  Anyway, I shall be returning, hardware
73 in tow, by the end of the week.  (Hear that the rest of you?)

89 menus but didn't find the exact one I needed yet. I'm working with a Z80 SBC (z80 cpu, sio, clock,
90 dma, etc) with a good old WD controller. It must be a strange CPM because I have had very little
91 trouble in the past talking to machines like this. Four more menus to go, but the last couple won't
92 do me any good. As of now, we are not missing any files. The last archive disk was 75 (apr 5th), so

99           PARLEY VOUS FRANCAIS?  OF COURSE, MOUSSIER.
100      I can speak a little French.  Words like cordon bleau, tete a
101 tete, parley vous Francais.  How about entre vous?  Literally
102 translated, doesn't that mean: ENTER, YOU!  If you ask me that doesn't
103 seem very polite.  Hmmm... I wonder how you say please in French.
104 strange how I know words like Escargot - baked snails - but not how to
105 say please.  I guess the French just aren't a polite people.  That's a
106 lot like the Mexican I've heard on T.V.  They'll give a sampling of
107 Mexican (Spanish) words and a thick Mexican accent so I get the
108 flavor, the essence - if you will - of the setting...  bull!...
109      For example, here is an actual Mexican conversation.
110 
111 Americano: Where is Senorita Maria?
112   Mexican: Senorita Maria is up in her uncle's hacienda with Don
113 Carlos, senor.  The bandalitosCare following them.
114 Americano: You're sure?
115   Mexican: Si.
116 
117  xcuse me, but what kind of Spanish is that?  I know many first-year
118  panish students who can speak better than this supposedly fluent
119  exican.  I think the filmmakers are trying for effect when they drop
120  his pseudo-Spanish on us, but why couldn't they be consistent?  Pick
121  NE language, guys, and stick with it!  More often than not, they'll
122  hrow in a Spanish word I don't know and then I only understand half
123  f what was said.  I imagine a Mexican watching the same show would
124  ndersand the other half.
125      Because of this, I have to hand it to Japanese movies.  When they
126  ake a movie, they do it all in Japanese.  If Americans want to see
127  t, they can dub in English... and we do.  There's none of this
128  ubbing in every other word, because half of it was already in
129  nglish.  No, they do the whole thing in Japanese.  They're not
130  oncerned with being 'international' like we are.  Bravo, senors
131  apanese.
132      German is a lot like Mexican.  They use the thick accent and a
133  ew German words, like: Kapitan, danke schoen and sauer kraut. 
134  espite all this, I think the most well-know German phrase is  Heil
135  itler.  ...Pathetic...
136      Italians just talk fast.  They use words too, but fortunately
137  hey're all food.  Words like: spagghetti, fettuccine, lasagna, garlic
138  read, etc...  I think I'll award Italian the most delicious language
139  ward.  With words like Escargot, French certainly didn't give any
140  ompetition in this category.
141      Latin is like Spanish and German, except that it is used more in
142  ooks than in movies.  They have the common abbreviations like i.e.,
143  irca, et al, etc...  These are usually used in writing to confuse the
144  eader.  You see, Spanish, German and French dictionaries are readily
145  vailable to many people.  But when was the last time you saw a Latin
146  ictionary?  Hard to come by, aren't they?  I think this is why Latin
147  s considered the language of intellectuals.  Only the people with
148  ood memories can remember any of it.  Also, Latin is a dead language.
149   Nobody speaks it anymore.  It is just used in reading and writing. 
150  nd as we all know reading and writing are dead these days.  The last
151  hing that bugs me about Latin is that it has less to do with English
152  han many people think, yet it is ingrained in our national heritage. 
153  ook at any U.S. coin and the words e. pluribus unum are emblazoned
154  ratted line noise and ctrl-c's ugh

158      It was one of those hot summer nights, the kind you only get in
159  he Big City.  I tossed back and forth in bed, looking for a cool spot
160  n the pillow.  I had thrown the blankets off sometime during the
161  ight, and lay now sweating out in the open.  I'm the kind of person
162  hat just can't get back to sleep once I wake up.  So I climbed out of
163  ed and looked out the window to see the black skyline of the city
164  ighlighted against the glow of the sky.  The cries of the Big City
165  roiling in the summer heat drifted up to my third story apartment
166  here a red neon sign flashed outside my window.  I live in one of
167  hose cheap hotels.  You know, the kind couples rent for the night
168  fter coming out of a bar across the street.
169      I put on my clothes, getting ready for a late-night walk down
170  hird Avenue.  I locked the door to my room realizing, of course, that
171  he rusted hinges could be easily broken by any Big City lowlife.  The
172  ords 'John Winchester P.I.' were hand printed on the door.  That's
173  e, John Winchester, the best P.I. this side of the Big City river.  I
174  alked past the desk clerk on the way out.  He didn't glance up from
175  eading some cheap book.
176      I walked out the the door of the hotel and headed for the bar
177  cross the street.  I don't drink much myself, but I was looking for
178  ome life outside my room.  The smoke-filled bar room contained an
179  ssortment of social classes.  I sat down at the bar and ordered a
180  in.  Halfway through my drink a frightened woman passed behind me and
181  hispered into my ear "please help, men are following me."
182      After getting a closer look at her, I thought I knew why men were
183  ollowing her.  Then I noticed two thugs calmly following her out. 
184  fter seeing the bulge of a gun underneath one of their suits, I
185  ealized her body wasn't the only thing attracting them.  Not being
186  ne to refuse a woman in distress, I cautiously followed the two thugs
187  ut the door.  Besides, this is how I get most of my business.  As I
188  eered around the edge of the door, they were already grabbing her and
189  orcing her in front of them.
190      I stepped up to the nearest one, who fortunately had the pistol
191  n his right side.  Having formerly been a pickpocket, I skillfully
192  ifted the weapon, implanted it in his back and wrapped my left arm
193  bout his neck.
194      "Don't move and release the girl."
195      The other thug, seeing his partner in jeopardy, let her go.
196      "Don't make a sound and go back inside the bar." I ordered.
197      I released the thug and they both obeyed without speaking a word.
198  I kept the gun for safety.  I have had so much practice with Big City
199  lime that I rarely get in fights myself.
200      I quickly took the lady to my office across the street, where I
201  new the thugs hadn't seen me gone.  If there's one thing I hate, it's
202  uys who think they're tough and if there's one thing I love, it's
203  omen.
204

243 With a violent motion that strained seatbelts, Farley twisted the wheel with
244 the skill that comes with NET training, no matter how brief.  Several near-
245 collisions and white hairs later, Farley brought the van to a stop on a 
246 deserted side street and paused to wipe sweat clear from his eyes.
247 Elsewhere-
248 IAN4 scanned the RD's communications COMSET station with what would have been
249 a satisfied look if an android were capable of such.  Somewhat earlier, it had
250 paid a visit to NET's vehicle division and modified a particular van.  It
251 finished its task by placing a violet-colored cartridge back in its resting
252 place.  With a quick turn, it moved to the wall that IAN1-3 and IAN5-6 rested
253 against in their niches.  It placed itself carefully with its own niche, and
254 set itself for timed awakening.  Click.
255 Still somewhere else-
256 Nick Douglas was storming about one of the Experimental sections, angry that
257 precious time had been wasted on a service call for a robot assembly arm that
258 was in perfect working order.  Probably someone's idiotic excuse for a joke, he
259 thought to himself as he neared his own workstation again.
260 Back at the van-
261 "James, how did you know...?" Farley whispered, beads still shining on his
262 forehead.
263 "Gut feeling, Eugene.  I get them sometimes.  Also, I thought I saw a fat guy
264 messing around near the vans as we were doin' the paperwork."
265 Farley thought for a moment.  "Something's fishy here.  Call the Vehicle

266 section on the COMSET, we've got to get back to HQ."

271    "You know this circuit, Parity?" Fellows could barely get the words out.
272 The CD/ROM case whirred away. Two seconds went by. Parity didn't answer. "We
273 can't let this one get away. We have to get those discs, if they are in
274 there." Two more seconds.
275    Parity wasn't paying attention to Fellows. He had enough on his mind. The
276 NET was building state-of-the-art booby-traps these days. The only thing that
277 could save both the agents and the contents was the training NET gave was also
278 state-of-the-art.
279    "Fellows, this is E11, right?"
280    "Yea..yes. You'll need to..."
281    "I know. Hand me the s-free clips. Then get the cutters ready. We have to
282 get the case detached from the explosive mechanism. Start prying the container
283 with whatever you can find."
284    Fellows quickly put aside his fears. "Twenty seconds." With a large screw-
285 driver and a Kershaw knife, Fellows began loosening the CD/ROM container from
286 the rest of the case. Parity continued on the component board, searching for
287 a way to breach the circuit protection and disconnect the firing mechanism.
288    "Fifteen seconds, Parity."
289    "Don't give me any damned James Bond count-down! How are you coming on
290 the case."
291    "Don't worry about me. Stick that fuse!"
292    The only sound in the room was the whir of the timer, the clatter of
293 instruments, and two men breathing hard. The later was ten seconds away from
294 being replaced by a deafening explosion, then deathly silence.
295    "Parity, I got the container!"
296    "Ok, five seconds? Screw the bomb. Open the patio door and duck!" 
297    Fellows was closest to the door. He hit the latch, flung the door open,
298 just as what was left of the carrying case flew past his head and out the
299 window. Fellows could see it start to make its descent towards Las Vegas Blvd.
300 South as he hit the wall-to-wall carpeting. The sound of the blast reached
301 his ears just as the device went out of sight. The concussion took out all
302 the windows in the room, as flying glass went everywhere. Fellows could feel
303 debris strike all along his body despite his prostrate position. A sudden
304 sharp pain in his side caused him to shudder. 
305    "Dammit Parity! I didn't duck enough."
306    "Glad to hear you are mostly Ok, Fellows. Can you stand?" Parity bent 
307 over his friend, his smile disappearing as his eyes fell on Fellows' wound.
308 "Doesn't look too bad, but there's plenty of blood. What did Ian use to call
309 these? Flesh wounds?"
310    "Haha Parity. I'm glad to see you still have your sense of humor. Now help
311 me up." Parity gave Fellows the requested hand. Fellows cringed as he tried to
312 stand upright. "It's worse than you thought, doctor. We better get out of here,
313 shouldn't we?"
314    "Yes. Lean here while I collect our stuff." In seconds, Parity had
315 collected the CD/ROM container, the COMSET, and both agent's packs. "Ok, lean
316 on me. I don't want another run-in with Las Vegas's finest."
317    "Got ya. Say, are those sirens I hear?" The familiar wail of law enforcement
318 and fire vehicles could be heard coming up the boulevard. "We don't have much
319 time. Get us outta here!"
320    "Settle down Fellows. I think you might be going in to shock. The rental
321 car is in the basement. We'll take an elevator down. You just had to much
322 to drink in the penthouse bar. No problem."
323    "And the blood?"
324    "Well, you know how those penthouse bar-fights can get pretty messy."
325    "Parity, we got it didn't we?"
326    "Yes, Fellows. The CD's are ours. And we didn't even get a scratch."
327    Fellows didn't answer. Parity dragged his friend to the elevator, which by
328 some stretch of the imagination, was standing open, waiting for them.

335 Mikey: believe it or not, the SA III is actually going to be used for it's 
336 original purpose. I've got a minor job to do for a friend, but it involves
337 a lot of data entry. Since his machine doesn't have the storage capacity 
338 required, but does have terminal capability I'm gonna loan him the SAIII.
339 Then I can load all the data into one of my machines here & work on it.

343 I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT.  I KNOW WHAT IT IS!  AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
344 THIS SEEMINGLY ETERNITY OF SEARCHING...SEARCHING FOR TRUTH, FOR MEANING...
345 THE ANSWERS TO ALL OF LIFE'S QUESTIONS.  I HAVE FINALLY LEARNED THE ANSWER.
346 I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LIVE AND I UNDERSTAND WHY WE LIVE, HOW WE LIVE.  I
347 KNOW THE ANSWER TO MAN'S MOST BASIC QUESTION:  WHAT IS LIFE?
348 HOW LONG HAS MAN TRIED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION?  HOW LONG HAVE PHILOSOPHERS
349 SEARCHED FOR THE ANSWER AND ONLY TO HAVE POOR LITTLE ME FIGURE IT OUT?
350 I KNOW! I KNOW!  WHAT A DISCOVERY!
351 
352 THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: WHAT IS LIFE?    IS SO OBVIOUS IT COULD BE HARD
353 TO OVERLOOK, YET MAN HAS DONE IT FOR SO LONG BEFORE I HAPPENED BY TO KNOW
354 THE ANSWER.  AND WHAT IS THE ANSWER?  I WOULDN'T BE A PHILOSOPHER IF I TOLD
355 YOU, BUT LIKE I SAID, I'M NOT A PHILOSOPHER.  SO I WILL TELL YOU WHAT LIFE IS.

441 You are confusing censorship with editorial rights. Censorship is *someone else*
442 telling Mikey what he can or cannot allow on *his* equipment. An editor has the
443 absolute right to not print items that do not meet with his approval. He (and/or
444 the publisher) are supplying the "soapbox". 
445 If you don't wish to place items that Mikey finds objectionable on a BBS, find
446 one that will accept them or set up your own.
447 Freedom of the press (or BBS) does not mean that you can force someone to
448 print your views. It means that *they* can choose what does or does not
449 get printed. 
450 Before you try to drag freedom of speech into it, please let me remind you
451 that Freedom of Speech says that you can say what you like (and be liable
452 for any libelous comments). It does not say that I have to let you say it
453 on my private property.
454 If you can't abide by the (extremely few) rules that Mikey sets, then you are
455 "tresspassing".

511 Risk?  The classic world strategy and conquest game?  Fabulous! Stupendous!
512 In order to play, why don't you visit Parker Bros.  They make it, I think.

515 Is a classic experience that pits the minds of normal gentlemen against each
516 other. Of course whenever gentlemen are pitted against each other, they 
517 seldom stay gentle, and begin lobbing armies and warheads 'gainst their
518 neighbors with reckless abandon. Women are not above such actions also.
519 Many a female has lost her cool when threatening armies draw close. All in
520 all, it makes good family fun.

526 The mere fact the Mikey makes this system public is in fact no right
527 giving act.  However, the users of the system, in past comments, have
528 left comments that tend to show that most anything is really allowed
529 on BWMS.  Within reason of course.  Profanity and the like would be
530 expectantly deleted, however I have seen messages and other commnts
531 that are'nt in any way negative or anti-BWMS that become delted twenty-four
532 hours after they are seemly entered.  I think the persone who left the
533 (I mean person) censorship message was trying to get the point across that
534 it seem as if only Mikey and his cronies get there messages left on the
535 system.  I personally have left messages of non-profane, non-comie and in no way anti-BWMS to friends and seen them
536 deleted 24 or 48 later.  Why?  Thats the true question here.  Why are
537 such innocent messages deleted?  I'm not the only one to whom this has
538 happened.  I'm not saying that I demand the right to use Mikey's personal
539 equiptment, only that if the system is advertised as being so open as 
540 the log on message states, why are Non-Mikey cronies messages being
541 deleted???  If he wants a system for him and his cronies like "JD"  why does'nt 
542 he make it a closed system with a log on password system and only give
543 passwords to his croonies.  then people like me would have no means by
544 which to bitch and he would be free of the need to edit all the time!!  He also
545 would be free of twit problems!!  Or is the problem that some people have
546 this huge craving for having there name in lights.  Being listed on other
547 BBS'es with headings like "Mike Day -- system operator".

556 BAC... Where are all these messages of yours? I never see them and I log on
557 here quite a bit. I am not one of the cronies as you so elequently call them,
558 but I have never had a message deleted. The only stuff I have seen deleted
559 have been blatent sexual, abusive, or threatening messages against Mike and
560 other users of this system. You might compare this excellent record to some
561 of the kid-operated Apple and Commodore boards in town where any messages
562 berating the host computer or software are quickly deleted and the person who
563 left the message flamed and/or deleted from the user roster. The sparks on
564 backwater are trivial compared to some of the childishness seen on boards
565 like Tellstar, Atari club, Hacker Jack, and various AE boards. If you want
566 censorship and excitement, I suggest you take your autodialer over there.
567 As for leaving multi-line diatribes on alleged censorship here, you'll find
568 a system that has as few rules as BWMS is the most open system in town when
569 it comes to the antics of computer users. I don't call the immature adult-
570 boards like REBEL, which means you can swear and tell dirty jokes and boast
571 about your endowment, open boards. I call them kid boards. Just look at
572 their audience. Open your eyes and look at the number of systems you can
573 gain access to in this metro area. Do you still feel a need to be a pain
574 in the ass here?

596 BAC: From your comment regarding "24 to 48 hours later", I suspect that your
597 msgs were merely shifted to drive B. This happens whenever the disk gets full
598 or neraly full. It is also possible that your messages were victims of the
599 (few) times that Mikey forgot to put the system back in ENTER ONLY after 
600 removing garbage (such as a disk full of carriage returns). In ALL ALLOWED
601 mode *anyone* may delete msgs....
602 By the way, have you ever seen your msgs after you've logged off? If not,
603 you may have forgotten to go back to the Command prompt (">") and type OFF.
604 If you just hang up, your msg may not be saved.
605 Alex: looks like I can make it. How about a few 30-sided dice?
