 39 Wow!  You guys should of seen this.  A 7up can sitting on my desk suddenly 
 40 and for no apparent reason (it was empty) violently imploded.  After months
 41 of queries and research, I have discovered that when the sheets of metal are
 42 flattend to be cut, not all of the stress is taken out of them (it occurs in
 43 the cooling process) and that it is possible for a part of a soft drink can
 44 to be made of a piece that will snap back to form.  Just think if I had just
 45 opended the can and then it imploded (UCK).

120   He tried to focus his attention at the eyes...  "The eyes," he thought to
121 himself, "the EYES!"  The sweat continued to flow from his brow as his
122 frustration grew.  "The is simply a mind game for the ConTroller to play. This 
123 time I'll win!" he exclaimed to himself.  As he focused his attention further
124 into the eyes of the reflection on the wall to his right, he saw the layers of

126 was broken for him to continue down the corridor... to seek the ConTroller.

176         Hidden Issue:  A.C.L.U. vs. C.I.A.
177    
178         With both presidential candidates running toward the center (when 
179 their campaigns are not busy running negative ads), neither seems willing to 
180 own up to, campaign on or elaborate the core difference that distinguishes 
181 them--namely, the difference between the C.I.A., which George Bush directed, 
182 and the A.C.L.U., whose card Michael Dukakis carries.
183      
184         Consider that, as Speaker of the House Jim Wright pointed out, David 
185 MacMichael, a former C.I.A. analyst, told the World Court under oath that the 
186 C.I.A.'s anti-Sandinista actions were undertaken in the hope that "the 
187 Nicaraguan government would clamp down on civil liberties within Nicaragua, 
188 arresting its opposition."
189         
190         There you have it.  The C.I.A. is for covert action, the A.C.L.U. is 
191 for civil liberty.  The C.I.A. is in the disinformation business, the A.C.L.U. 
192 is in the freedom of information business.  The C.I.A. is involved in the 
193 manipulation of the democratic process, the A.C.L.U. is dedicated to 
194 protecting the democratic process.  The C.I.A.'s mission requires deception, 
195 the A.C.L.U.'s mission requires revelation.  The C.I.A. believes that the ends 
196 justify the means, the A.C.L.U. believes that the means can't be disentangled 
197 from the ends.  The C.I.A.  takes it as its duty to subvert alien ideologies, 
198 the A.C.L.U.  argues for the right to hear them.  The C.I.A. plays the 
199 assassination game, the A.C.L.U. opposes the death penalty on principle.  The 
200 C.I.A. finds the Bill of Rights an inconvenience, the A.C.L.U. regards it as 
201 inviolate.
202     
203         Even those sympathetic to the A.C.L.U. may be reluctant to frame a 
204 campaign in these terms because the union, after all, has only 250,000 
205 members.  To these faint hearts we say, How many members/employees does the 
206 C.I.A. have?  The answer is that it's a secret, and that, after all, is the 
207 point.

229     Dave had been traveling for several straight hours now, and the trip was
230 making him weary... All he wanted now was a good bed to lie on.  But in fear
231 that the ConTroller might catch him in his sleep, he fought the urge away.  He
232 popped a couple of caffeine tabs, and kept going.
233     Soon, though, the weary traveler was dozing off while he walked.  So he
234 gave up the fight, and leaned against a wall, rolling up his pack to make a
235 nice fluffy pillow.  "What do you think you're doing?" asked a voice from
236 behind Dave's trail.
237     "Do you think you can just curl up in a cute little ball and go to sleep
238 just anywhere you want?" the voice demanded... "Wha?" asked Dave, being as
239 distinguished as he could in his current state. He turned his tired neck around
240 so that he could see back down the corridor, and there stood a large, armoured 
241 creature, with a large fluffy mustache, and thin greyish fur covering its face
242 and extremities.  "Wha," he asked again, trying to sound violent.
243     "Ok, get up... You're not in any condition to talk, so just get up..." said
244 the furry creature.  "How long," asked Dave, "have you been following me?"  The
245 furry creature wiggled its nose and said, "Oh, 'bout 8 hours or so... Been
246 tryin' to stay outa sight 'till ya nodded off.  You know, easier the catch."
247 Dave had to ponder this for a moment.  He hadn't seen anything since the battle
248 with the ConTroller's trick wall, so he wondered if this was another one...
249 He yawned loudly, and then posted the classic interrogative, "What's yer name?"

302 This is your last chance
303 ************************************************************** 
304 When a plague in the densely populated Rachelis System races out of
305 control, help from the Enterprise is enlisted in the medical emergency.
306 But while preparing to transport samples of a deadly plasma plague from
307 a Federation research station to a site where a suitable antidote can be
308 developed, the crew is stunned by an unexpected announcement: Counselor Troi
309 is pregnant.
310  
311 According to Troi, a glowing white light impregnated her while she was asleep.
312 Dr. Kate Pulaski, the ship's new Chief Medical Officer, confirms Troi's
313 prognosis and reports that the fetus will reach full term within 36 hours.
314 Not knowing the true origins or intent of this mysterious child, Picard puts
315 the crew on security alert.  But when Troi gives birth to a boy named Ian,
316 he appears to be completely harmless -- although he amazes his mother and the
317 crew when he grows from an infant to an eight-year old child in one day.
318  
319 Meanwhile, Wesley reluctantly prepares to leave the Enterprise and join his
320 mother, who has departed to become head of Starfleet Medical.  Full of mixed
321 emotions, Wesley decides to stay with the ship after receiving encouragement
322 from a new crew member named Guinan.  Later, when Wesley discusses his plans
323 with Picard, the Captain agrees to let the young ensign remain as long as his
324 mother permits it.
325  
326 However, a sudden crisis with the plasma plague puts everyone's future in
327 doubt.  It seems that a contaminated specimen of the hazardous strain has
328 inexplicably begun to grow on the cargo deck due to radiation from an
329 unknown source on board.  Dr. Pulaski reports that, at its current growth rate,
330 the plague could wipe out the ship's entire population within two hours.
331  
332  
333  
334 Unknown to all, Ian is the source of the radiation, and when he realizes this,
335 the remarkable child decides to sactifice his life to save the crew.
336  
337 As a heartbroken Troi looks on, Ian dies and his body reverts to its original
338 state -- a glowing white life-force entity, which tells Troi that Ian had come
339 to her to learn more about humans by experiencing life among them.  Once the
340 entity leaves the ship, the threat is averted and the crew continues their
341 humanitarian mission.

346 QUAYLE ON DEFENSIVE DOWN TO THE WIRE
347  
348    WASHINGTON - Dan Quayle's vice presidential campaign has been haunted by
349 his past, doubts about his qualifications and the perception he has led an easy
350 life in which the truly tough problems were solved by mom and dad.
351    Controversy marred his elevation from relative obscurity to the national
352 spotlight as George Bush's running mate. And it stymied his attempt to show the
353 country he was more than "just a pretty face."
354    The notion that the Indiana senator was born with the proverbial silver
355 spoon, never having to struggle for money or power, is borne out by his past.
356 As Quayle once told an interviewer, "Life has been very good to me. I never
357 had to worry about where I was going to go."
358    Quayle, 41, has constantly had to defend himself against charges he is
359 unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. In response, he touts
360 his chief accomplishments in 12 years in Congress: co-authorship of a job
361 training act and detailed work on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty
362 and other arms-control issues.
363    Before his Oct. 5 debate with Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
364 Bentsen, Quayle frequently added another point, saying he has about the same
365 legislative experience that John F. Kennedy had when he sought the presidency
366 in 1960. That line was dropped after Bentsen's devastating rebuke: "Senator,
367 you're no Jack Kennedy."
368    Quayle denounced as "side-events" questions about his military service,
369 academic record and personal life, but his campaign has never completely
370 escaped them. Signs reading "Chickenhawk," "Who died in your place, Danny?"
371 and "Sissy Rich Kid" confront him from one state to another.
372    Quayle's grandfather was the conservative, self-made publishing magnate,
373 Eugene Pulliam. In 1955, Quayle and his family moved from his native
374 Indianapolis to Phoenix, where his father, James, ran Pulliam newspapers and
375 joined the John Birch Society. The Quayles returned to Indiana in 1963 and his
376 father became publisher - and young Dan eventually became associate publisher -
377 of The Huntington Herald-Press.
378    His performance at DePauw University was average. Graduating in 1969 during
379 the Vietnam War, Quayle would have been eligible for the draft but instead
380 sought admission to the National Guard. He explained to reporters that he did
381 "what any normal person would do ... call home to mother and father and say,
382 `I'd like to get in the National Guard."'
383    One of Congress' more ardent hawks, Quayle insists he wasn't trying to dodge
384 the draft - just to be able to attend law school - and that no undue pressure
385 was applied to get him into the Guard. But a retired major general acknowledged
386 that he asked that a space be held for Quayle after a retired Guard commander -
387 a Pulliam employee - called to recommend him.
388    The future politician also had to do some explaining about how he managed to
389 get into Indiana University School of Law when his grades clearly were lacking.

440    Attacking others usually is considered part of a deep inferiority
441 complex.  At least by AMA standards.
442  
443    Accusing others of wrong-doing because they are not perfect is one
444 thing.  Accusing them and then saying that you are without flaw is another.
445 With that last sentence, the immaturity of the Dukakis attack message
446 shines like a thermonuclear blast.  If the candidate you back (I would
447 presume Bush for the moment) is so superior, then why fear the other
448 candidate winning the election?  By logical choice, that candidate that
449 you would vote for would win in a landslide election.  This and other
450 problems glare out at me.  I'm personally tired of seeing fanatics
451 bash away at what little is left to human life.  I apply this both to
452 the so-called "Left" and "Right" extremities; both seem a little
453 half-assed in their concepts anyway.  If you claim to be a member of
454 the human race, then GET OFF YOUR FAT ASS AND LOOK AROUND.  You migt
455 learn something - like how to love, pity, fear, and understand other
456 human beings, who are (more or less) in the same predicament that you
457 are in - that you exist in an environment not of your own chooseing,
458 that others face the same problem, and that you can either work
459 together and share what little there is, or work against each other
460 to gain all that there is.  Or, if your mind is of above-avarage
461 material, then you would do a little of both - help yourself, but
462 help others, too.  Or, if this concept is beyond you, you can leave
463 the members of this board alone and go bully someone else - I'm
464 NOT going to take it from you, nor anyone else.  Criticizing opinions
465 are one thing; stating "facts" and forcing your opinions on others
466 isn't right.  And people who do that sometimes get hurt, if you get
467 the hint.  Either tone it down, or face the consequences of your
468 own actions.

490 Recently, several mathmaticians got together to examine the mathamatical
491 creation of the universe.  They found that in order for the "Big Bang"
492 theory to be valid, the "Bang" had to be timed to within 10^35 of a second
493 or the universe would end up collapsing upon itself or simply disintegrating
494 into nothingness.  Also for the next second afterwards certain occurances
495 would have to be brought about that could not have been done "naturally".
496 In other words, the universe could not have just "happened" but the
497 evidence suggests it to be created under labratory conditions by some
498 intelligent being.

515    "Werfle.  Don't laugh, " said the creature to Dave, "it's really my name.  I
516 really think that my parents named me that as a joke, but anyway... "  Dave
517 yawned again, stood up and faced him.  Realizing that Werfle was two feet
518 taller than he, Dave raised his eyebrows and said "Hmmp...  Not a likely match,
519 eh?"  Werfle wiggled his nose and said "Not really... hehe.   What's yer name?"
520 "Dave.  What are you doing down this far?" he asked.  "I'm seeking the
521 ConTroller.  As I saw in your confrontation, you've had experience with him as
522 well.  When the ConTroller took over the complex, my  family was killed as a
523 demonstration of their 'sheer power', or so they called it.  I have set out to
524 gain my revenge upon the Controller.  Why are you after it?" Werfle rattled.
525 "I've been sent out by the underground council to seek and destroy it.  I live
526 in a city below the surface where the families of the city have fled to find
527 refuge from the anarchy of the ConTroller.  We stumbled upon the location of
528 this defense complex three months ago, and traced down the map, but to find the
529 ConTroller itself is another task."
530    And so it seemed that David J. Whitmoir had made a friend.  The fact that
531 his name was as laughable as "Werfle" seemed to make no difference to him.  He 
532 could be as appreciative as the next guy.

555 The wanderer had stepped through the gate by the Inn and emerged into a grassy
556 field.
557  
558 Sheep and goat grazed near by and in the near distance he could see a small
559 hill atop which sat a large brown building.
560  
561 He strode confidently forward avoiding the occasional dropping. At the botom
562 of the hill stood a sign that read "Life intoxicates". He smiled somewhat
563 sadly at this and started up the hill.
564  
565 The only sounds coming from within the building were the low groans and snoring
566 of overindulgence. Not wishing to wake the occupents he sat down on the 
567 step and began to meditate. 
568  
569 The face of the veiled one appeared in his mind. There was a mystery there. His
570 gaining of the orb had shown him that. He sensed that it was not within his
571 powers to gain the answers and so for the time being pushed the face from his
572 mind.
573  
574 Next he saw the face of his master. Dead now many years. Though the bound of
575 aprenticship had been brocken long ago he still felt like the aprentice.
576  
577 There was one other face, though he could not quite make it out. It was a
578 face that had haunted him for as long as he could remember. And yet it was
579 always indistinct.
580  
581 He felt sure that it was the face of a women, but whom it belonged to eluded 
582 him.
583  
584 There was a sound behind him and he broke from his revarie. Looking back he
585 saw a bleery eyed old man.
586  
587 "Damn, somebody stole the paper again. Carl! (yet another alias of the 
588 wanderer.) , ouch! I'm getting to old for this. Come in lad, the brothers
589 are just arising for the morning meal."
590  
591 "Thank you Ben, It's been a good long time since I've been by, how are things
592 at the monastary?"
593  
594 "Oh, not to bad. We gained two new recruits this month. brings our numbers to
595 45."
596  
597 "That's good to hear, is the dancing one still here?"
598  
599 "I think I heard him leave early this morning, must have been 9 or so."
600  
601 "I'd like to talk to him before I leave."
602  
603 "Suit yourself" Been mumbled. "Come on in. Breakfast's on."
604  
605 And so the wanderer entered the monastary.

675 Hello, Cassandra here......being amused by the political mud-slinging.
676 Not too much different from what you hear in mundania, is it?
677 That should be a warning signal.  I'm trying too figure out how to 
678 vote right now, myself.  The way I see it, I have these options:
679  
680       1)  Vote for Dukakis
681       2)  Vote for the Democrat (this is NOT the same thing, although 
682           operationally equivalent in this case)
683       3)  Vote for Bush
684       4)  Vote for the Republican
685       5)  Vote for some other valid candidate (smaller party or independent)
686           with whose positions I could best agree
687       6)  Vote for a bogus candidate (i.e. Randee of the Redwoods)
688       7)  Vote for none of the above
689       8)  Not vote
690  
691 Voting for a party, rather than a candidate, is okay if there is really a 
692 difference in platform and support base, and the party officials can make 
693 the individual in question toe the line once in office.  Such is not the 
694 case.  
695  
696 The two major parties are two different flavors of vanilla.  I can not 
697 support either party, nor the candidates they offer to us.  They all have 
698 serious flaws, in my personal opinion (which I needn't defend here).  The 
699 fact is that all of us here, I suspect, feel the same way to some degree. 
700  
701 Other candidates divide the vote, because they tend to stand for one point 
702 or special interest group--I don't want a President in office whose only 
703 concern is to stop abortn (or lower taxes, or save the whales).  Even 
704 a laudable goal does not make a President. 
705  
706 Voting for a bogus candidate or "none of the above" registers ones 
707 displeasure with the system and its current choices, but it really does 
708 nothing to change it.  It seems to me a waste of a vote.
709  
710 It is a citizen's duty to vote--if you don't vote, you shouldn't complain 
711 about the outcome.  The problem is that I'm NOT complaining about any 
712 given outcome, I'm complaining about the options.  How can I, in good 
713 conscience, vote for someone in whom I can not believe?  How can I not 
714 vote, when that is a citizen's duty.  Okay folks, what do you think?

733    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of Latvians for Bush has stepped down from
734 his post in the wake of allegations that he belonged to a World War II group
735 with Nazi ties, the Bush campaign announced Thursday.  
736    Akselis Mangulis, who was also a volunteer with the vice president's
737 Coalition of American Nationalities, has "suspended his membership" in Bush's
738 ethnic group, said Alixe Glen, a spokeswoman traveling with the Republican
739 presidential nominee.  
740    Mangulis is the eighth person connected with Bush's ethnic council to step
741 down following reports of connections to Nazi or anti-Semitic groups.  
742    Editors at The Philadelphia Inquirer said Thursday night that they were
743 planning a story on Mangulis' membership in the Latvian Legion, a group which
744 had connections to the German SS, the quasi-military unit of the Nazi Party, fo
745 Friday's editions.  
746    Bush campaign spokesmen in Washington and on the campaign trail told
747 reporters early Thursday evening of Mangulis' "suspension."  
748    Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said the Mangulis' family confirmed the
749 association, but said he was conscripted in that group against his will.  
750    "The charges lodged against Mangulis deserve to be clarified by him away fro
751 the Bush-Quayle campaign," said Goodin. "As of this time, his volunteer
752 membership in the Coalition of American Nationalities is suspended as he pursue
753 that right."  
754    But a woman who qnswubed the phone at the Mangulis residence in Andover,
755 Mass., denied that he had been asked to resign from Latvians for Bush or had
756 been a member of a group sympathetic to the Nazis.  
757    "He was not resigning and he will run until Mr. Busx is elected," said the
758 woman who identified herself as Mrs. Mangulis but refused to give her first
759 name. "Bush campaign did not ask him to resign. He did not resign because he di
760 nt have reason to resign.  
761    "He is not in any group in0Wob|d War II," said the woman, who spoke with a
762 heavy accent. "He was a young man and he is not a Nazi and he is not
763 anti-Semitic. I'm telling you honest and truthful. All are lies, never did he
764 resign, never was it no shame."  
765    She0sait the family is seeking legal assistance and "I am going to take
766 action for this harassment."  
767    She said her husband was not home.

901     I was the one with the creationist view.  Like I said in my message in

903 no intentions of arguing it, or convincing you of or proving to you the views I
904 have.  
905     To put one thing perfectly straight, the NIV version states "In the
906 beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."  This might suggest to a
907 beleiver that there was NOTHING before then.  Although the earth was formless
908 at the time, and there was no light, before "the beginning", nothing could be
909 more obvious than that statement.  the word "CREATE" means "TO MAKE FROM
910 NOTHINW," am I not correct? Hmm.

950 On Creation- How could you forget Einstein? One conclusion that derives from
951 his famous equation, E=mc^2, is that matter can be `rodused from energy, 
952 just as tremendous energy can be produced from matter. The atomic bomb 
953 proved the latter. For this reason, astrophysicist Josip Kleczek stated: 
954 "Most and possibly all elementary particles may be created by materializq-
9%5 tion of energy."
956    Hence, there is scientific evidence that a source of limitless energy 
957 would have the raw material to create the substance of the universe. The
958 Bible writer Isaiah wrote: "Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has sbeated
959 these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them [stars]
960 even by number, all of whom he calls even by name. Due to the abundance of
961 dynamic _energy_, he also being vigourous in _power_, not one of them is
962 missinw." 8Isaiah 40:26)
