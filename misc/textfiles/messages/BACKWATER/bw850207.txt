116 Jack H.:  Thanks for the comments.  I very much enjoy your and kathy's
117 story.  I am a bit confused about your identity(s)... No matter.  Keep it
118 up.
119 
120 tilleen(sp?):  I find your style to be one of the most creative I've seen.
121 It reminds me of a gentleman known as John Dos Passos.  Although not as
122 well-known as Hemingway, in my opinion he is one of the great American
123 20th century writers.  Like you he had a knack of using multiple 
124 perspectives and breaking all rules for punctuation, syntax, and 
125 capitalization... the effect was awesome.  If you get a chance, check out
126 his U.S.A. trilogy.
127 
128 Adrain:  You, sir/madame, are a genuine Backwater trendsetter.  You have
129 broken the Inn from its fantasy, spy, discussion cycle into the new realm
130 of relationships.  I like it, but heaven help us if I get started in that
131 vein.
132 
133 BH:  Nice poem a disk or two back.  I loved it.  It aroused the romantic
134 in me.
135 
136 All:  I can't help reflecting on TMA's mention of writer's workshops.  I
137 was in one for several months and found it a great spur for my productivity
138 and creativity.  Unfortunately, I was the only male and the only person
139 under 60 in the group.  The nice old ladies took to chasing me around the
140 parking lot after class.  So, I left the group, but I miss the interaction.
141 If anyone here is interested in forming a writer's workshop drop me a note
142 here, or to my keeper, Michael Bigham, on the Bit Bucket or CBBS/Aloha.
143 Perhaps we can discuss the matter.

175 Subj: Harry "Sluggs" Floster, Elite Agent Run Amok
176 As you know, Harry Foster escaped from UNDERGROUND's Portland Med Lab just a
177 few $days ago.  Intelligence reports Harry has been sighted in northwest
178 Portland.  He was, at the time, sprinting at what was clocked as 340 mph.  This
179 means, therefore, that Acclerotine does indeed work.  Keep on the lookout for
180 Operative Foster.  O'Hara out.

183 Portland (AP) -  In an amazing display of speed and reflexes, a "Mystery Man"
184 inadvertently got into a 10k run nheld in Milwaukee and won it easily, officials
185 reported today.  "He was just incredible!" one onlooker said.   "No one saw him
186 until the race was half over, but he was goin' like a gazelle!"
187 Before the race's officials could award the man the trophy, he kept running and
188 was quickly out of sight.  More religious spectators declared the man to be
189 "a demon straight from the pits of hell.  No MAN can run that fast.  We see
190 this as a sign that God has judged footracing to be an evil act,, about as bad
191 as burning a Bible."

197 the-minute. Not for long mind you, just to read the lines since last I've
198 called in. Anyways, could you possibly leave me message on, say- PCS? I don't
199 call there as often as here, but I will check now and then for your name on
200 any subject, namely concerning the smearing of this Inn of yours. Thanks!

246 I think i finally got up enough courage to put something on this board.
247  
248                                To Fence
249  
250         It was a few years back when I decided that I would do something 
251 daring. I am not a very aggressive person at all, I just thought it would be
252 sort of awesome to try something that would be a new challange for me. Besides
253 I needed the PE credit anyway. When I looked in my little blue and gray 
254 pamphlet that told me what classes I could take, I guessed that it was about
255 time that I started taking some classes other than my basic running and
256 fitness class, one that I had made a habit to start out my long days with.
257         After I chose to skip the obvious running class, I thought that I
258 might like to try gymnastics. I loved watching the guys do all those neat
259 things back in high school, but decided that I would try something different.
260 Gymnastics frightened me so much, there was so much I could do wrong, so much
261 many ways that I could hurt myself. I cried for not having taken it now. Why
262 was I always affraid?
263         One thing I told myself that I would probably never do was to try
264 fencing. When I had seen some people come over to my gradeschool when I was 
265 in the sixth grade, the whole thing looked so electrifying, so    so fast!
266 Those four people in their immaculate ( or did it only seem that way to my
267 eyes of a child? ) white outfits seemed to know just exactly what they were
268 about to do. They all looked so happy, and so awesome! They became kind of 
269 like gods to me, something I knew I could never become.
270         Eventually the daze of the whole thing went away although I still
271 loked to watch the old Errol Flynn movies, he was still one of my heros.
272 Hack! Hack!  Take that you meanies!  Hack! Hack! Stab! Bleed. Die. Darkness.
273 It all looked like so much fun, then the hero would die. I swore I would 
274 Never watch that movie again! How can they let a good guy die?
275         After I settled down from all the amazement and the daydreaming, I
276 took another look at my little schedule and what it had in store for me.
277 I didn't ever notice that it had fencing in it at all before. The words kind
278 of turned on like a brand new light when i finally saw them. I toyed with
279 the thought for a long time and came to the conclusion that, Yes, that 
280 would be about as daring as I'd like to get.
281         After I had signed up for the class, ( I got card number 8, that
282 didn't look too good ) I actually decided to go to the first day of the 
283 class, a Tuesday, to see what I had gotten myself into. As it turned out, the
284 class was to be held on the floor downstairs from the main level. Great, in
285 the "basement." When I walked in the door, all I saw was about a dozen or so
286 guys that were about ten feet taller than me ( almost ten ) and only one
287 other girl. I stuck out like a match on fire with my long red hair. I felt
288 sick, everyone in the room stared at me as I went up to the instructor to 
289 give him my class card. I almost cried again. They were cruel.
290         One of the first things that my new instructor told us to do was to
291 forget all about what we had seen in those hack movies, none of it was true.
292 My heart sank a little more. ( Forgeet awl ah-bot zem. ) The next thing he 
293 said was that we wouldn't even do any fencing at all this week or part of
294 the next. Wow, did that make me mad! ( Yoo muss first leern ha too huld
295 them rat een your haand. ) I almost couldn't understand his really thick
296 real French accent, but I learned. His name was Yves, and although not to
297 many of the others would talk to me, he was always there when I needed to 
298 get some advice.
299         Well, after a long an horrible couple of weeks, the strangers had
300 become a new breed of briends for me. In a short time we all learned how
301 we could "out-think" the other with the simple maneuvers we had taken so 
302 ( Friends, not briends ) we had taken so long to learn. It was neat to be
303 able to out-fox those guys after a little more practice! 
304         I guess that all it took was for me to decide to dedicate myself to
305 a special something, and to go for it all the way. After taking the class for
306 a second term to "shapren" the skills I had learned with the blade, I felt
307 confident enough to join one of the only two clubs in town, in the entire
308 part of the state even. 
309         When I finally found where the club was, ( it's called a Salle ) I
310 felt scared all over again. Would the people inside treat me the same way
311 that those others had way back when I started this whole charade? I was 
312 surprised to find out that they didn't. When I walked in the door, everybody
313 was watching someone in a white fencing jacket fence someone in a Black
314 fencing jacket. "That must be the Master of the Salle" ( Actually he's 
315 called "Maitre" not Master. ) He had noticed that the door had been opened
316 even though he had his back to the door. After he scored a quick point 
317 against his student, he stopped, took off his mask, and walked halfway to
318 greet me and shake my left hand. 
319          As I soon found out, the Salle ( I won't say which one, just 
320 knowing that it has a door should tell you if you know ) has many 
321 courtesies that you should follow. One is to greet the Maitre as soon as
322 you walk in to the Salle. Another is to greet everyone that is present,
323 with a handshake if possible, or at least a "hello" and a nod if someone
324 is having a lesson pounded into them. ( Zat way! No! Zat way! Hack! Hack! )
325         One rule that you knew existed was the rule of Honesty within
326 the Salle, during practice, competition, and everywhere. I have never met
327 such an awesome group of people before in my life, they were all "the boy\
328 next door" kind of people.
329         Although I haven't kept up with my fencing obligations, I still
330 remember having met those friends, those heros, and those Olympic Team
331 members that have helped me so much. I loved tham all dearly, and promised
332 to return to them sometime even if it was a long time later.
333        I don't know if this means anything to you, but it sure made me feel
334 good to let you know that there are another bunch of neat people out there.
335 Just as neat as the people I get to read here whenever I get the chance. I 
336 just hope you are all going to remember a little piece of this story like I
337 remember the stories I read here at times.
338                                           with love,
339                                           Becky T.

345   I felt the new strength flow into me, like the warmth of too much wine, it
346 flowed like honey out into my arms and legs.  The feeling would not last long.
347 My training was not deep enought to stave off this kind of sickness.  I quick-
348 ened my pace.
349   My vision was now crystal clear and through the thinning trees I could see 
350 some kind of clearing.  The moonlight slipped through the clouds, for a moment
351 showing me the way.  On the far side of the clearing was a swall building with
352 a stable ajoining.  The moon gave an erie incandesce to the smoke curling from
353 the chimney.  
354   There was light coming from the windows, spilling onto the ground in broad
355 golden squares.  My legs began to run, my boots slipping on the wet ground,
356 my heart pounding in my chest.  I ran like a lunatic, hands trembling, spittle
357 flying from my mouth.  I could feel the blood rushing in my ears.  In the time
358 of a footstep I knew what was happening.  I had been warned.
359   The pressure in my head struck me like a sledgehammer.  I could not even hear
360 my scream.  Convulsions took my body and I pitched over, my face in the mud.
361   Seizures riped through my body.  I heard tendons in my leg snap.  The last
362 think I saw was the glow of the light falling on the mud around me.

368  this note is for the person who posted two obsence messages on the
369  walls of our respected Inn, using my border and penname.
370 
371 slan-der 1: the utterance of false charges or misrepresentaions which defame
372 and damage another's reputation 2: a false and defamatory oral statement
373 about a person - compare libel, scandal - slan-der-ous.
374 
375 scan-dal 4: malicious or defamatory gossip.

380 (3): the publication of blasphemous, treasonable, seditious, or obsence
381 writings. (4): the act, tort, or crime of publishing a libel.
382 
383  so much for definitions of these writings, moreover i wish to convay
384 not a feeling of anger, but discord. when my home was invaded by several
385 phone call, waking me from needed sleep, a great feeling of contempt lay
386 simmering. i thought to myself "self, whom have you angered recently?"
387 no names or faces could be visulized.
388  
389 and so, if you don't like how i write, or dare i say, are jealous of
390 my popularity(earned or not) please place direct comments to me on
391 this or other systems. just for general information, the phone number
392 published will still be a working number, i however will not be found
393 there. i am moving tommorrow, my new number will not be forwarded and
394 will not be listed.
395 
396 to the other "good" patrons, please excuse this defense of myself, i
397 felt some kind of acknowledgement was needed.

405 Kathy: I'm sorry that this has happened. I hope that it hasn't put you
406 off. As it is well known, my policy in the matter is to remove the msg
407 and all references. Unfortunatly it takes time for me to get back to
408 here, and thus things like that can end up on the system for a few hours
409 before I can have a chance to do something about it.
410 I will be talking to the phone company tomorrow to see about putting
411 a tap on the line to put a stop to this once and for all. It has gone
412 too far.

420 Missing Minsky Detail : You had better be quick about finding your lost sheep. 
421  One can only imagine the emotional and physical torture she is probably being
422  put through at this very moment. Every man, women, and child has their
423  respective breaking point. There is no such thing as a pickless lock, just as
424  there is no such thing as a breakless mind. In a case like this, speed is of
425  the essence. Disregard the wayward unmentionables uttered by those who display
426  their lack of cognizance daily as if it were some sort of ritual. Put aside
427  the derogatory comments of those infantile cretins who's discourse can only
428  be described as flatulant. A time exists when all must be put to the wind, and
429  one basic mission; one all consuming purpose in life, must remain alone,
430  unscathed, and unhindered. Do this now, and don't come back empty handed.
431  Remember, one bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but an empty hand is
432  not worth a damn.

441 Alex : Avast ye matey... And swab dem decks... I have indeed seen an image of the Alchemist's craft. And a fine boat
442        it is indeed. If memory serves me correctly, a 45 foot Staysail Schooner. A beautiful sight indeed. Five working
443        sails, including the elusive fisherman. But there's more... The is a vessel from the old school. It hauls no
444        engine, no sir... The wind and the currents are its sole proprieter of movement. Truly a vessel fit for the open
445        sea. Three years our alchemist called this schooner his home. Voyages far and wide... What a glorious life! It
446        makes me yearn for the feeling of the salty breeze in my face, and the utter dependence on oneself for survival.

465 are here, we can and do offer our moral support and best wishes.  Although
466 a basically peaceful person,I almost wish I could find the perpetrator of
467 the deed and punch his/her lights out!  (luckily for me, this is not too
468 likely to happen -- with that evil a mentality, my lights might end up
469 flickering a bit.)  We who know you through your writing -- and it may be
470 a more real you than we could know in person -- know when this type of slander
471 is attempted.  We will be with you in spirit.

484 it was said long ago that he who cast a
485 sidelong glance shall soon be living a
486 sidelong existence. whoever said such a
487 sidelong thing can really believe such a
488 sidelong thought. for to me that is what a
489 sidelong person would tend to forget in a
490 sidelong way of life. it all starts out a
491 sidelong year ago without so much as a
492 sidelong yell of warning. it now finds a
493 sidelong time to remember what has been a
494 sidelong history of things and people and a
495 sidelong place to be. such is the life of a
496 sidelong missionary. living in the jungle a
497 catch thats soon to be. hunting in the forest
498 where large cats try to roam free. men come
499 who dont understand it, but it makes me feel
500 allright, when women come to visit, the end
501 is nowhere in visible sight. children like to
502 come too, and play and play and play, in a
503 couple sidelong years, maybe in a bygone day.
504 if you hurt enough inside, and the pains too
505 much to bare, the bones will crack, the face
506 will snap, and theres no one left to care

508     Becky T.: Yes, I will remember some.
509     Farley: I understand you reason for writing about the accident, I think. 
510 Not too long a time past, I was in an accident. I, a type who does not believe 
511 in her mortality, have often dodged Death and done such things labelled "Dare-
512 devil". The whole concept of death seems nebulus and foreign, farther off in 
513 the future than Christmas seems to a young child. Foolishly, I was not wearing
514 my seat belt; luckily, I was wearing my glasses. My head crashed against the 
515 windshield, just in time, I braced myself and fell back into my seat. Glass was
516 cascading onto my face. (Luckly, not into my eyes, or very little). 'Oh, God,'
517 I thought 'I am dead.' But, I soon relized that I was only in shock, I managed
518 to stumble out of the car on weak, almost paralyzed, legs. Alive.
519 "The universe was teaching you a lesson. You are lucky, it was a very reason-
520 able price." Was said to me later... It is all too strange... a have become
521 greatly more learned, it seems. But, still death is not a reality to me, even
522 when confronted by it myself. I can only wonder, have you read the newspaper
523 lately? I have seen two articles with children who have froze and been "brought
524 back to life". I wonder if they have feelings any different than we? -Tanya

526 The following is the text of a handout that was being distributed at the

531    
532    People often ask me how they can leave the planet, So I have prepared
533 some brief notes.
534 
535                      How to Leave the Planet
536    1. Phone NASA. Their phone number is  (713) 483-xxxx. Explain that it's
537 very important that you get away as soon as possible.
538    2. If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the White
539 House - (202) 456-xxxx - to have a word on your behalf with the guys at
540 NASA.
541    3. If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin
542 (ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-xxxx). They don't have any
543 friends there either (at least none to speak of), but they do seem to have
544 a little influence, so you may as well try.
545    4. If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number
546 is 011-39-6-xxxx, and I gather his switchboard is infallible.
547    5. If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and
548 explain that it's vitally important that you get away before your phone
549 bill arrives.

552 
     First, I wish to thank one and all for the messages left for me after
553 I last came to the Inn.  Cistop Mikey has been good enough to allow me a
554 peek at the disk dated January 27, 1985 so that I might see the support
555 that my friends here had given me.  It is hard for me to express the thanks
556 I wish to give to all, to let you know that what you've said was just the
557 boost my flagging spirits needed, and is a reminder to me that the spirit
558 of the true contributors here is on a very high plane.

559      Kathy, I didn't see what was left here under your name, and in a way
560 I'm glad I didn't.  I am usually a very quiet individual, and rarely do I
561 speak out strongly for or against a position, but from what I've read above
562 I feel a great need to do so.  Please remember that, though we don't all
563 speak up in complimentary tones, we enjoy what you place here nonetheless.
564 Two of my favorite entries here were by you (the Pirate adventure <snicker!>
565 and Digital Disk), and though I didn't say so at the time, they gave me
566 enjoyment.  Don't allow this individual to dampen your spirit or ruin your
567 zest for making entries here.

568      To the person engaged in the vandalism and libel:  Why?  I can't think
569 of a simpler way to phrase the question.  Are you incapable of creation on
570 your own, and therefore take pleasure from the destruction of the work of
571 others?  I find that hard to believe.  If you are capable of mastering the
572 skills necessary to use Backwater, if you can assemble a system that can
573 even reach Backwater, then you have proven to me that you are not lacking
574 in intelligence.  Do you have friends, family, loved ones?  How might you
575 react if you found that they were being harassed in this manner?  With
576 anger, pain, irritation, a desire for vengence?  Would you be filled with
577 rage?  Or what if it were you that was treated like that?  You don't even
578 need to respond to that, I think that we all know the answer.  Please, in
579 the future, imagine yourself as the recipient of what you plan to do, and
580 if you think it might not be to your liking, refrain!  I know that this is
581 undoubtedly the same sort of sermon that you've heard many times in your
582 life, but it is no less heartfelt for that.  I find it hard to really hate
583 anyone, because I know that inside everyone is something that can't be
584 hated.  Would you show us your good side now?  We've seen the portion of
585 yourself that is the easiest to let out.  Now show us the other.  Please?

590  I will remember your entry for more than just a while.  I think
591  you should write more often, your story was realy nice.  I see
592  that you haven't gotten many messages so far but I think they
593  will be comming by the dozens when more people read your story.
594  I hope you see this message when you call, wouldn't want you to

About this false message that was seen a while back about kathyd.
598  I think that was awful wrong to do, I wouldn't like it at all if
599  it was pointed in my dirrection.  Kathy is handling it well, maybe
600  the author didn't want it to be this way, maybe he/she wanted to
601  cause Kathy to loose face and popularity too.  Maybe they feel 
602  like they could never be, could never write like that so they must
603  pull someone down because of it.  At least there are still nice
604  people around here at Backwater to look forward to seeing.

617 something appeared... it was expected almost... whenever tilean stayed in any
618 hotel... whenever he left his room he felt he forgot something... a feeling of
619 utter redundancy too k over... and even though he felt stupid... tilean looked
620 in again...
621 
622   only a chilly wind from the open window... drapery was being blown about... a
623 chill reminded tilean of the reality of this... it was all so real... tonight..
624 a person would climb over the window... perhaps even pick the door... someway..
625 somehow... sometime... some agent had to steal their way into this room... and
626 search it... when they did... they would find all the evidence to discover the
