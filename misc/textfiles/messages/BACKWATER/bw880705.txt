 35 Well, we are certanily filling up the disk fast...
 36  
 37 I look outside as I wake up.  My ears are still ringing from last night.
 38 As we have tried to develop bigger and better fireworks, the sounds have
 39 gotten louder.
 40 I try to keep a grip on myself as I stagger downstairs for some coffee.
 41 Finally I manage to make it to the machine.  I pour a cup and lift it to
 42 my lips.  The steaming black liquid rolls down my throat. My senses clear
 43 some. As I sip the rest of the coffee, stopping at intervals to replenish my
 44 cup, I look outside at my driveway.  It is a disaster area.  Littered with
 45 scraps of paper, plastic stands, and matches, it is something to behold.
 46 I walk outside and the many remains of the pull-apart fireworks and snaps
 47 crunch under me like fallen leaves in autumn. I see the many stands and tubes
 48 from the whistles, fountains, and combinations of both.  It is hazy.
 49 Probably because of all the smoke things I set off. As I tiredly look around 
 50 for the broom and dustpan, I wonder if it was worth it.  But, as I sweep up
 51 the first scrap of paperI knew that everything, from the biggest fountain
 52 to the smallest smoke bomb and pull-apart, had been worth it.

106 Stray Cat, there are two ways to get rid of lines here. one is to
107 delete the line, and the other is to kill it. Kill physically 
108 removes the line while delete just marks it to not be shown.
109 Since the lines are still there but just not printed, they 
110 take up a line number. Thus what you saw was that someone had
111 deleted the last few lines since list shows the total physical
112 lines but can't print the deleted lines you saw the difference.
113 P.S. Parrot should be up, I just called (there was a power outage

118 Hello again, our revered guru is correct, everyone must be on vacation.
119 The board has began to slow down considerably.  I'd do something to stop
120 it, but I'm currently suffering from an acute case of writers block.  In

130 a cure for it, please tell me.
131 Oh, by the way, wouldn't it be nice if certain persons, I won't say any 
132 names (Zod and The Border Pirate might get angry if I said it was them) 
133 would remain on vacation permanently.

148 This is General Zod.  
149 I have returned to let you know that
150 I am still here.  I have been 
151 watching the rather trivial topics
152 that have been here as of late.  I
153 find them boring.  I did notice one
154 message about what is a criminal.
155 In your society, a criminal is one
156 who does not conform to your ideas,
157 a person who, by means other than the
158 slow "earn it" process, makes large
159 personal gains, or one who is very
160 capable of taking over, as it was
161 with myself on Krypton.  I, General
162 Zod, could have taked the entire
163 planet, which in itself was a
164 personal gain, but I would have
165 brought Greatness to Krypton, But 
166 that frightened those snivelling
167 idiots that called themselves Elders,
168 who were but old.  They did not see
169 beyone their own weakness...see the
170 possibilities that Krypton could have
171 been.  No, they feared, and they died
172 as a result of that fear.  In
173 watching this place, I have detected
174 some among you who could easily see
175 my cause.  Join me....I will rule, 
176 and this world shall be yours.  You
177 shall know greatness.  I, General 
178 Zod, declare it so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

243 Some one here at backwater suggested that General Bozod and The Bozo 
244 Pirate are the same person. I don't think so. Bozod uses a 40 column
245 machine (big letters are easier for idiots to read), while the Bozo
246 Pirate is irritating us via an 80 (I think ) column machine. If this 
247 helps in any way to get rid of these two twits, please use it.

257  
258    Hail, friend Friar!  It's good to see you back!  Yes, these are 
259 wonderous times (at least in this generation) and it sounds like you had
260 FUN!
261    The answer to your question:  The title is a name, and nothing more.
262 Everyone on the board will make of it as they will.  I decided for the
263 GURU spot because I felt at ease with it - no in-fighting with the local
264 TWITS (unless they REALLY REALLY ask for it) and more time to think.  I
265 do not presume any rank at all - that's for Lord Beaker & others to do.
266 In fact, I have NO ranking, just a name which appears as a title.  I
267 saw the way things were set up, and figured I could hang around without
268 getting in the way too much.  Simply put, I'm here to deliver swift kicks
269 in the Mental Dept. (not to mention to my own grey matter) because 
270 most people don't think about what they are doing.  If everyone did, the
271 world could be a better place for everyone.  I tried to tell that to Zit,
272 but he's just interested in being a sadist (doesn't leave room for much
273 else in his head :).
274  
275    Generic Zit, for the last time, you were POPPED & left to dry on
276 the line.  You really are a twit, you know?  You've been outclassed by
277 Lord Beaker, Talos, ME, Friar, Kurfur, P. Polymorph, ^C, & many others
278 that I can't remember off hand but are certainly worthy of mention.
279  
280    In other words, buzz off.  Just about every user on this board
281 outclasses you in shear weight of intellect.  This also goes for the
282 sidekick, The Border Pirate, whom I personally dub as 'The border-line
283 potato' because your intellect matches one.  And yes, your hunches are
284 correct, they are one and the same!  I can personally vouch for the fact
285 that I saw one of the Zit's messages in 80 columns!  That, or else he
286 discovered how to edit his lines, but I don't think so...
287  
288    Hagbard Celine, resident GURU, requests the aid of the inhabitants of
289 BWMS II to vote for the out-ing of 'General Zod', and 'The Border Pirate'.
290 Please leave a vote with your next message as YEA or NEA.  The vote will
291 be tallyed and handed to MIKEY for his approval. (sp) I cast the first
292 ballot: NEA.  These Bozos detract from the board, make us waste value-
293 able (less?) space on disks (a good example is me) fending their
294 moronic ideas off elsewhere, and also steal valueable time for literary
295 works, philisophical questions, debates, information exchanges, and just
296 having fun!  Go bugger dead pigs, you deadheads!  I've already 'defeated'
297 you once, I don't need to do it again!  THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING, ZIT.
298  
299    Sorry folks, but I sometimes become a little dramatic...the last lines
300 are for the two resident villige idiots.

310 As I said before, H'lo. I have just one thing to say, Ifit weren't for the 
311 twits, this board would be (sarcastic tone) fun and enlightening. I can
312 say one thing for them though, at least they write in regularly. But if 
313 there's one thing worse than a twit it's a regular one. I, however, vote 
314 that we keep them (I'm still curious as to how this Bozo Pirate found out 
315 about the Milton Freelance's Backstabber Brigade. We have only a few 
316 members, and only three of us have modems, and the Bozo Pirate doesn't 
317 sound like any of them. As to how I know that wassis face knows about us, 
318 read disk B. I know I didn't write that message in which Hagbard's border
319 was first stolen, and I know the other members didn't write it, for they
320 were not using their modems at that time). It seems that the Bozo pirate
321 first started stealing borders after he found out it irritated you.
322 It seems that these twits are only being obnoxious for attention because
323 they're terribly insecure. You don't spend as much time in an asylum as I
324 have without learning a little Psychology. In any case, I intend to find
325 out who these twits, or twit, may be, and how they know about the

360 was visiting my brother there who owns a recording studio.  Mostly audio
361 effects and voice overs.  (They had special names for them, but they lost
362 me half way through, with the Foley box.  I sai, it looks like a tray of

501 jeep repairs, free hand and a half swords (to put on the wall), computer

514 To those of you who are wondering, my handle comes from the name I was

516 Viking clan name (Redlig). This is to clear up any questions as to how

518 not the rat you smell, I don't have any whiskers as far as I know of,
519 but then again, you may be using the slang meaning, which still 
520 wouldn't apply (I may be a bit odd, but at least I'm not like our two

529    Anarchy?  Or Anarchism?  Whoever said the ref. about 'anarchy' needs to
530 read a good book...or see a movie...or go on vacation...or... you get the
531 picture.  Anarchism is CONSTRUCTIVE.  Anarchy is DESTRUCTIVE.  Simply because
532 it is easier to have anarchy than anarchism does not mean that it is
533 correct.  It would, by the same train of thought, be harder to stop running
534 when your fellow lemmings start heading for the cliff.  For the potential
535 of something 'good' (desireable) I would rather have anarchism (and stop
536 running towards that scary cliff...) - but if you wish 'to ignore the
537 easy path, and take the hard one, then you will give up heaven, and go
538 to hell'...
539  
540    Kurfur, I would like to have conference with you about psychology and
541 human nature.  There are still things that humans must discover about
542 themselves before the whole species self-destructs.  I therefore put forth
543 a premise: "It is possible to have life without it self-destructing."
544 Please ponder this.  I wish to test this out...

547 home and suck on your fudgesickle.  I'm tired of having _______s like you

558 here, we can even lock out the twits!  They'll be so irked they might
559 even shoot themselves from the frustration of trying to annoy everyone 
560 here!  Besides, I can make all the gold we need... & the barkeep doesn't 
561 mind...and everyone will have a good time!
562  
563    Mecury, L. Beaker, Kurfur, ^C, Friar, myself, & anyone else we
564 choose is invited.  Sorry if your name doesn't appear - just say you
565 want to join, and you'll pop right in here (at my whim - unless Friar
566 sends you back...but I think him to be a resonable person.)
567  
568    Say, did you catch any brand names?  Sounds like the good stuff to me 
569 (pun not intended) & well worth 2 mil.  Barkeep, (URP) a pitcher.  And
570 here's the advance on the party [barkeep's eyes widen and his pupils
571 narrow as he drops the pitcher] - and a little extra for the pitcher.
572 Bring another, quick!  My friend and I grow thirsty, and there is much
573 for us to do!

586 KKKKKurfur Redlig / A twitless party, sounds great, any Mead?????????????
587 Hagbard, our most reverred and twit ignoring guru, I think your theory is
588 sound, take Limpets for example, they are alive, and they never hurt 
589 anything, including themselves. However, I think I can add some offshoots.
590 Intelligence without wisdom brings certain destruction. Existence brings
591 destruction, for all things that begin must end. Life, however, is 
592 eventually scheduled for destruction (look at my last point), but it 
593 doesn't (and this is the major point here) have to bring destruction upon
594 itself. That strange creature that calls himself modern man (of which I,
595 reluctantly, am a member) doesn't seem to realize this, but it's no use
596 telling man that, for primates rarely listen to what they don't want to 
597 hear. It's easier (as you said) to follow the crowd, straight into hell.
598     But on to more interesting things. Just as I said before, does the
599 Inn this twitless get together will be at (terrible grammar) serve mead?
600 If it does, then I most humbly ask to join you. If it doesn't, then 
601 anything along the lines of intoxicating hydrocarbons will have to
602 suffice. Also, will there be a twit check, or will we just ignore them?
603 Also also, to get there, do I take a left at the edge of nowhere, or 
604 just banf it and hope for the best?
605 KKKKKurfur Redlig / Am I acting (gag) mature again?????????????????????
606 Oh, by the way, I should like to meet this Lord Beaker. I noticed he hasn't 
607 been around for quite some time. Is he off combatting twits or something?
608 KKKKKKKurfur Redlig / the only good twit is a silent oneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

690 KKKKKKKurfur Redlig / All hail Lord Beaker, the anti-zoddddddddddddddddddddd
691 H'lo der agin. Did somebody mention a quest? If so, please tell me if you 
692 need someone to bash infidel heads, get terribly intoxicated, say meaningless
693 things, hunt Smurfs for food (they're great with Tabasco), and sleep on 
694 guard duty (though not nessecarily in that order). Basically, do you need a
695 Berserker? If you do, I'm all set to get to work (or play as the case may
696 be). I promise to go into a berserkergang frenzy at attack everything in
697 sight only occasionally. I might also prove useful in the comedy relief
698 department (but I think Zod and company have got that covered). 
699     Lord Beaker etc. well met! I should sertqinly hope that you are here to
700 stay for a while. We need a little help in the twit buster area. Also (I 
701 seem to say that a lot, don't I?), don't worry about spelling, it just 
702 means your brain is working too fast for your fingers.
7030    Hagbard and other thinking persons, what do you think about mankind's 
704 job of stewardship over the planet? I personally think (amazing, I can 
705 actually think!) that man has majorly blown it. I mean, look at how he goes 
706 around acting liku he0owns the place, putting profit before ecology. 
707 Eventually, man is going to waste himself (if things go as they are), but
708 does he have to take the planet with him? I live here too you know, but,
709 thanks to bipedal primates, I'm finding it insreasingly hard to remain so. 
710     I hope I haven't offended anyone here with my message. The Smurf thing
711 was pushing it, but that's how I feel.

824  
825    A hearty greeting to everyone!  I've been phasing in and out recently,
826 but I think I will be here for a awhile now.  Yes, mead, ale, wine, and
827 other things from strange lands called Coca-Cola Corp. and Pepsi Inc. 
828 will be served, along with every known drink in the galaxy!
829  
830    Shakespeare- was he a real genious, or did he just look better than
831 Mr. Bacon (which allowed him to0sway the ladies with his 'prose')?  Or is
832 that theory bunk?  What is the deal with this english reject anyway?  And
833 why do we have to read everything in 'olde' English vs. Modern English?
834 Or at least have the poor students have both side bi0sidu for comparison, so
835 they would feel fortunate, and study English harder so we would all speak
836 better English than the Japanese (no offense meant)????
837  
838    Friar, a twit is akin to the insect that borrows between your toes and
8390bituc them as you walk.  They are also just as hard to get out, except
840 it takes more than singeing (sp) your toes with a hot wire....

845 'sane' minds amoung people)
846  
847    Kurfur again:
848    I don't eat smurfs.  I just absorb their essence for food.  The dark-
849 blue husk that remains usually returns to dust,0as Smurfs are not real life
850 entities (is that word play? :) ) that can reproduce.
851  
852    And again:
853    You're right, man has screwed up his own house by letting his
854 kitchen drain cleaner drop into his refrigerator, and all over his |uncx...
855 if something is not done soon, say, with the Amazon Forest, there will not
856 be a place left for my children and your children and their children to walk
857 upon this place of earth and trees and sun and sand and sea and nights...
858 ufen0as we speak, (? I guess) our air supply is being depleted in the name
859 of progress, as the Amazon Basin is chopped and cut and burned and hacked
860 and misused, for it doesn't belong to one group of people - it belongs
861 to everyone.  The Amazons `rovide 25% of the oxygen in the air...and
862 'scientists' are already warning about 'the Greenhouse Effect' and
863 ozone depletetion and increased skin cancer and bad droughts and 'El Nino'
864 and ... you get the picture...

869    Friar Again:
870    Adventure?  Can we have it after the party, or do you want to make it
871 part of the party?  (gulgulgu|gulgulg) (ahhhhh) And do your feet still
872 touch the floor, or does your forehead do that?  Also, everyone except
873 General Zod and The Border Pirate are now invited to this dimension...
874 simply turn left at the library of myths, go straight, stop at the
875 corner of limbo and reality.  There you will see a long long long string.
876 Touch it.  You will be SWISHHHHED into it.  The sign on the Inn should

889 H'lo0agi~. I'm glad I didn't offend anyone with that Smurf commen. 
890 I think, however, that some of you are wondering as to why I like to 
891 eat Smurfs. Well let me put it this way. They taste overly bland, but
892 preparing them, and the final consumpdio~ is so enjoyable. First, you
893 skewer them and roast them slowly over a very hot fire, basting with 
894 your favorite seasonings occasionally. Then, allow them to cool, 
895 remove the stick, and eat by dismembermant. Yes, Smurfs are the 
896 u|dimade 'finger food'. I know this sounds a little sadistic, but I've
897 had to put up with LAA LAA LA LA LAA LAAAA for years, so I think I'm
898 justified.
899      Why are we so hung up on Shakespeare? (Sudden topic change, huh?)
900 If you want a gbuat rritish author, try Mallory or White. Mallory,
901 because he did things (he was the only unpardoned participant in the
902 war of the Roses), and White, because he has a very clear view of
903 things. But this isn't a report, so on to other subjecds.
904      What happened to that new 'Twilight Zone' series? That was the 
905 sanest, thing on TV I'd seen in a long time, and it disappeared.
906      Interesting thought here. We're creating a greenhouse cloud 
907 around the earth heating things u`. Then, when it gets too hot for us,
908 we turn on the airconditioning, and destroy the ozone layer in doing
909 so. Isn't the Earth getting wonderfull? We can sweat and fry at the 
910 same time.
911      Great, I can join in the quest, can't I? Jusd remember, if 
912 anyone needs my assistance, I'll be asleep on guard duty.
913      Oh, by the way, I'm still writing my Mindless Drivel, but the 
914 statements have gotte longer and become paragraphs. You just read 
915 some of them.
