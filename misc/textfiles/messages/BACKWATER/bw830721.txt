34      any comments as to the ethics
35  of genetic research?I've just been
36  reading of how the favorite bug
37  for such research is E. Coli.,a rather
38  sedate bug (as bugs go),that lives
39  most of its life in our intestines.
40  Yep,folks,thats right,if they should
41  happen to come up with a particularly
42  noxios version of E. Coli.,guess who
43  catches hell first!That's right,us!.
44  Such an obvious mistake in judgement
45  would lead me to believe that 
46  government saction and support to
47  such reasearch should be funneled into
48  something like the space program.

72 Aaron, they've ALREADY come up with an eEXTREMELY noxious E. coli strain!
73 It was developed to convert waste cellulose into methane (for fuel). It does so
74 QUITE well. Then someone pointed out that it was still capable of living in
75 humans. What would the effect be? Well... there is usually enough cellulose in
76 your guts to keep it producing merrily. How much? Several cubic feet (!) an
77 hour. SEVERAL CUBIC FEET!!!!!!! you say. And just how fast can this gas escape?
78 UH, lesse now... (looong pause)
79 about 1/3 to 1/2 as fast as it's made.... oops! 
80 
81 Said bug is in storage until someone comes up with a way to make it safe to use.
82 The above is true (to the best of my knowledge) and happened several years ago
83 (BEFORE the moratorium & new standards).
84 The researchers aren't fools, they know that a mistake could kill them (remember
85 THEY will be the first to get it if there is a "leak"). The main reason for
86 using E. coli is that its ENTIRE genetic code has been mapped. As far as I know
87 it is the "highest" form of life for which this is true.
88 
89 ps. what a horrible way to go! "terminal" case of gas.

96    ACTUALLY, E. COLI IS USED IN RESEARCH WITH RECOMBINANT DNA 
97 (OTHERWISE KNOWN AS GENE SPLICING) BECAUSE ITS GENETIC MATERIAL
98 (OR CHROMOPLASTS CONTAINING CHROMOSOMS) ARE DIVISIONED INTO VERY
99 DISTINCT PARTS, WHERE MANY TYPES OF BACTERIA HAVE CHROMOSOMES SPREAD
100 ALL THROUGH THEM.  SCIENTISTS MUST BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ONE SET
101 OF CHROMOSOMES AT A TIME, AND E. COLI LENDS ITSELF MOST EASILY
102 TO THIS PURPOSE.

112 Actually, there is another very good reason for using E. Coli: there is
113 very little chance of it escaping, as it can't live outside, so it is fairly
114 safe, even if a particular version seems dangerous. as to the dangers of
115 gene splicing, note well that several viruses are known to live solely by
116 gene splicing, and it may well be that they all do. It isn't so rare at all,
117 we have just discovered it. Again the argument against gun control: without
118 a person to point it, a gun is "just an expensive paperweight" <sorry, Walt>
119 The same is true of any technology: it can be used for good or evil, and
120 as the methods are now becoming known, ignoring it will only mean someone
121 else will benefit.
122    How about putting the loboratory working on dangerous germs into orbit?
123 Hard vacuum with strong UV from sunlight is a pretty good quarantine.
124 Remember Britains experiments with germ warfare, and the island that is still
125 not safe to live on.

128   yes,Bad,its true that E.Coli dosen't
129 fare well in the real world,yet they
130 don't really have to, the have an 
131 extremly agile and multiplicitive 
132 vector on which to be vectored.
133   as to satellite research stations,the
134 cost would be prohibitive to the average
135 individual/corporation/country,in theroy
136 ,at least,it would be a good solution,
137 yet satelites are known to fail (and 
138 fall),so i would propose a moratorium
139 on ANYTHING spinning around up there
140 until it can be made to stay up there.
141 A chunk of SKYLAB might be fun to have
142 fall into your back-yard,but not if
143 it brought the Andromeda Strain with it!

151 The good and gentle innkeeper has noticed the newcomer to
152 the inn. The folds of his cloak still obscure his face.
153 Of all the people in the inn he obviously is not seeking
154 to draw attention to himself. He is merely waiting and
155 observing, awaiting the proper time to make himself known.
156 the innkeeper and some of the more perceptive guests sense
157 an aura of power eminating from the figure. So much so
158 that the innkeeper is hesitating to even serve him.
159 Though it be a contradiction to the very reason he built the
160 inn, the innkeeper avoids the newcomer. it is hard
161 to judge whether his power be black or white. It is
162 noticed however that when the debate in the inn becomes
163 heated, He shows signs of restraint in keeping himself
164 from the discussion. Why?
165 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
166 As the Innkeeper returns from his long journey, he spies an intruder
167 in his Inn. This intruder would presume upon the Innkeeper many things.
168 But it matters not for as long as he keeps his peace the Innkeeper will
169 leave him be. The ruffians that seem to have gotten in somehow are
170 of a different matter, and the Innkeeper not too gently shows them
171 to the door. Ahhh, he sighs... peace again if but for a moment. And
172 with that he returns once gain to his customary table to sit and
173 watch the comings and goings of the people in his fair Inn.
174 **** CISTOP MIKEY DURING GARBAGE COLLECTION DAY **** 14 JULY 83 ****
175     Ah, well it may be and a dubious duty for 
176 eful yet protective innkeeper to push those
177 from his threshold that he deems unproductive to the
178 tmosphere of such a welcoming place as this.
179 The existence of which is the very characteristic
180 thct has brought our dark figure to this inn. Woe 
181 be he who would entangle figuratively or otherwise
182 with our gracious keeper of the inn with any other 
183 than the most honorable intentions.
184     However inlikely it be that circumstance should
185 require the aid of another in the keepers debates
186 within the walls of his inn, somehow he must realize and 
187 now how to summon the power of this being. A
188 thought suddenly looms in his mind... A word
189 of which he has no recollection and no explanation.
190 Yet he knows that by the mere utterance of these
191 syllables, he will call upon the knowledge and 
192 strength of our figure.
193      The word comes to him like a beacon...

256  A darkly clad knight steps into the
257 half light of the inn.  For a moment 
258 continual murmur of conversation is
259 halted as the habituates of the tavern
260 turn to study the newcomer.
261   Their curiosity temporarily sated 
262 they return to their interrupted conspi
263 ricies.
264  Seemingly ignorant of the effect of 
265 his entrance the small man shakes the
266 accumulated dust of a hundred highways
267 from his beaver cloak and walks quietly
268 to a table hidden in the shadow beneath
269 the overhanging balcony.
270   He draws  a worn leather pouch from 
271 beneath his cloak and looks toward the
272 inkeeper.
273  
274  He shakes the bag gently and the 
275 sharp clink of gold insinuates itself
276  upon the broadbodied manager dozing
277 behind the rough wooden plank that 
278  serves as a bar.
279 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
280   The knight pulls the dark hood from
281 head.
282 His broadfeatured face, first appearing
283 young, admits to more years than would
284 be supposed.
285   He speaks, and his voice, more vivid
286 than would be thought from appearanc
287 insinuates itself upon the steady
288 background mummble of the room.
289  "There is to the east a provence in
290 which they produce a most magical brew
291 They condense, from the spirit of 
292 fermented grapes, a liquor; which
293 they then hide for many years in
294 wooden casks.

306 apparent much has changed about the
307 comfortable inn,yet for the moment
308 the patrons put aside their curiosity
309 and procede to get royaly sloshed,and

395 I have a problem. It is not a big problem, but . 
396 It is 2 cats, very friendly ones.
397 I picked up a magazine to read, and immediately Fang jumped into
398 my lap. Sara joineed him.
399 Fang, however, is not willing to just sit there and purr, he wants
400 to be friendly, so he climbs over my arm and sits in the middles
401 of the mag and rubs his head against my arm. I dump him. Sara rises
402 into the magazine. Purr. Fang climbs the sofa and onto my shoulder
403 and rubs his nose against mine. On a warm day who needs a warm cat
404 on his lap? I pet them. Purr. They stand up and knead their claws
405 into my leg. Eventually they settle down, I pick up my mag, and
406 it starts all over again. Fang rubs against my arm, jiggles the
407 mag. Sara climbs into the middle and purrs. I can't read, so I
408 give up, throw the mag on the floor and go upstairs to the computer
409 to read about the Inn at the Backwater.
410 Oh, well i can't blame Fang for his identity crisis. How would you

466   yes,because the limited affect of
467 an "artistic element" is limited to
468 the minds of those it touches....
469   while a "bio-chemical revolution"
470 will be with humanity till the 
471 end of the planet itself.........
472   
473 p.s. i think a little compassion is
474 in order towards our friends the 
475 dragons,it is such a sad sight to 
476 see them hobling down the street
477 with those white canes......

489 TO THE PERSON OWNED BY SARA AND FANG: YOU ASK WHO NEEDS A WARM CAT ON A WARM DAY? WELL IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE A VERY LUCKY PERSO
490 TO HAVE TWO SUCH AFFECTIONATE BEINGS AT YOUR SIDE REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER. SO OFTEN WE FORGET THAT SUCH LOVE IS NOT SO FREELY
491 GIVEN AND SHOULD REFLECT ON OUR GREAT PLEASURE TO KNOW WE ARE LOVED. ABOUT A YEAR AGO I LOST MY BEAUTIFUL   
492 "NA AAALII SNOWFLAKE" A MOST WONDEROUS FEMALE PERSIAN (BORN IN HAWAII). THERE IS HARDLY A DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T THINK OF HER
493 AND WISH THAT ONCE MORE SHE WAS IN MY LAP, ON MY PILLOW OR ASLEEP AT ME FEET ON THE BED. I STILL HAVE HER BROTHER "NA ALII AN
494 ANDROCLES" AND LOVE HIM EVERY BIT AS MUCH BUT THEN HE IS NOT HER AND THE LOSS IS FELT AS HE IS A CONSTANT REMINDER OF HIS OLDER
495 SISTER. OH THAT ALL CREATURES COULD LIVE WITH
496 WITH THE SAME LOVE THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO SHARE WITH OTHERS. YOUR TALE OF SARA AND FANG GAVE ME GREAT PLEASURE IN BRINGING B
497 BACK FOND MEMORIES OF MY OWN:

502 Oh yeah? You think that you have neat cats? Take MINE into
503 account. His name's Ambush. I nammed him that for what he does
504 to me any my family. He was over playing by a ball of yarn
505 next to the TV set. I was about 20 feet away. I said in a soft
506 voice "KITTY?" He looked up. I put all fingers out to form a
507 kind of a claw and hissed. He arched his back, pinned his ears
508 curled his tail and ran at me sideways. He also, every morning
509 at 6:00am would without fail jump on my bed, purr VERY loudly
510 and wake me up. He put his wet nose in my eye and trys to go
511 to sleep. But, this was when he was at our old house. Does
512 anyone know of a way to get my parents to allow my cat in the
513 house again? They won't let him in, even in my room! I do love
514 him though.

539 The apprentice had not been seen in the inn since the day the
540 Dragon Lady departed. He finally reappears, though his manner is
541 still sad. After resting in his accustomed place (an old stool
542 at a table in the farthest corner, as befits his station), for
543 some time he finally notices the changed atmosphere of the inn.
544 	His face grows sadder, as prepares to return to his
545 master. Suddenly, a strange expression crosses his face and he
546 speaks. His voice is quiet yet carries throughout the inn.

548 	Out of her breast
549 	a blossom ascended.
550 	The summer burned it.
551 	The song is ended.
552 	
553 	On this note he departs.
