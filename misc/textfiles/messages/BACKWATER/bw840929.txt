20 My name is Brad Littlefield, 254xxxx, and I just purchased this modem and Iam 
21 having trouble getting a ctrl/C.  The 
22 modem I purchased is 'total telecommunications'.  I was 'told' to hit the arrow 
23 key at the top left of my computer to get the ctrl/C but it does not work.  Nowh
24 ere in the book does it give this information.   I like the Modem, but the softw
25 are that comes with it is terrible.  The instruction book is of very little valu
26 e.  I would like any help I can get in  learning the operation of using Modems!
27 I was LUCKY to be able to hook into yourmessage system.  I am going to leave my 
28 
29 computer on automatic answer .

33 Alex : Well I guess Dave and I will be there for sure. I am not sure if I can
34  muster any VOL though. Who knows what the dice will do now. I have not been
35  able to contact Leonard about going. I may see him up at OMSI at the PAUG
36  booth. See you around 7:30-8:00pm.
37 Quizmaster : Well I don't know if you have heard, but instead of walking in
38  the sand in my bare feet, I will be walking in my nikes at OMSI. Such is
39  life. I will pick you up for the trip to Risk. NO need to come by here. I
40  don't mind the extra drive. In fact, I may even come a bit early. Doctors

53    We understand from our current reading that the government intends to
54 resume carcinogen testing on laboratory animals. We must protest this 
55 blatant infringement on the rights of animals. It is the duty of every
56 human to support the rights of the non-sentinent creatures that also 
57 inhabit this planet.

66 Is there goining to be anyone at OMSI demonstrating MODEMS? Some of us new users would be better able to use systems like
67 this if different systems were more consistent in their commands, or if the commands were explained more thoroughly.
68 Thanks for lettining me sound off.

77 Well, they had modems there, but nobody was using them much. I had to show somebody from the Sanyo club how to put a "dial 9,
78 wait,number" on his hayes, he was wondering why the modem kept answering with omsi people when he dialed BBS numbers!!
79 All, on drive B there is a story of some kind that has the signoff line like the one I use. Please do not think that I wrote
80 it or put my signoff there.

128 Where has all the beauty gone?  The Inn has become filled with
129 senseless screams of nothingness.  PAM, d, grey ghost, Emer, Tarn
130 Elger... Where have you gone?  Why have you left?  The Inn keeper
131 does not even show anymore.  Is the Inn doomed to disappear 
132 altogether?  Sadness fills my heart at even the thought of a
133 loss so great.  Will you ever return?  Will you leave the Inn
134 forever barren?  Never to hear the lilting voices of calm and
135 beauty again?  Arghhhh... I cannot even stand considering the thought!
136 Will you not return to grace us once again with your words?  Please?

139 Hello, All! Just thought I'd drop a line to ya all, so here goes: Oh, the sadness of life! Why do the rich get richer, the poor
140 get poorer, and the dumb get dumber? Why does life keep changing it's questions?
141 Does Burger King Microwave it's burgers? I think, there ffore I am confused, that life is perpetual, however short it may seem.
142 It will be a great day when schools have all the money they need,
143 and the Air Force (formerly the U.S. Army Air Corps), has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber. 
144 I'm bored, and I'm proud of it! Ravings make the world go round. Maybe the above rats should break out of the lab and go on tou
145 . Wxat the heck do I know, I've got post-nasal drip.Something tells me
146 that I must be off, (specifically my psychitrist...), so I better go.
147 Keep a song in your heart, and take my advice: Pull down your pants and slide on the ice!
148 Well, I'm done now. Everyone else raves on and on and on and on and on and on,
149 so why shouldn't I! Well, Auf Wiedersehen! Gruss Gott!

247 Have you ever stopped to think that if the bell-curve model for distribution of intelligence in a population holds
248 true, 25% of the American public is Critically Stupid? The real question is how all of those people seem to end up
249 in public-service positions.
250      && The Mad Actor &&
251 or how many of those people seem to end up leaving messages like the last
252 one above, or Mike Inc. above that? Never in all of my days have I witnessed
253 a more wretched mix of garbage and waste than I have seen here for the last
254 500 or so lines. Can it be that the place once known as the Inn is now
255 descending to the lower parts of the earth, where the vermins and the
256 cretins rule the roost. I truly dread the day when this happens, for it
257 will mean the end of an otherwise fascinating life style. For this I
258 am saddened. Is there no white night out there who can deliver us from
259 the evil clutches of the lower earth dwellers, and return the inn to
260 its former state of graceful prose and meaningful melodic messages?
261 
262 
263 '''''''''
264 I really don't have very much to say but what happened to the old Inn?
265 When I first logged on it was a cheerfull place with stories and nice
266 talk but now it is just cluttered with junk.  Where have all of the
267 originals go?  Why did they have to take all of thier stories with them?
268 There is a message above mentioning a new board DYM or something.  Please
269 don't call, the number is to some old guys house who doesn't know anything
270 about what is going on.  He can still remember what it was like when computers

297    "C'mon, Sweetie, c'mon now."  The piper was careful to keep the irritation
298 out of his voice.  He had a short rope wrapped around his waist with abouth a 
299 five foot length extending bowstring-taught to the halter of a small calf who
300 was pulling with all her week-old might.  Suddenly the calf shook her head and
301 ran towards the piper, gathering speed and slack as she shot past him.  Both
302 ended at the same instant, nearly pulling the piper off his feet.  The piper 
303 sighed.  The calf had pulled itself off it's feet and was laying on the grass,
304 glaring ferouciously at the world.  The piper moved over and nudged the calf.
305 Sweetie refused to budge.  The piper dragged her over to a tree and tied the
306 lead rope to a low branch, then stepped away to watch.  Eventually, the calf
307 forgot her irritation, gathered her feet underneath herself, and got up.  
308    All was peaceful until she moved to the end of the rope -- then the week-old
309 little beast put on a magnificent display of kicking, bucking, running, 
310 pulnging, jumping and other acrobatics that had the piper whistling in ama-
311 zement.  Her antics soon subsided, and she stood with a very little slack in
312 the lead rope, a picture of bovine disgust and resentment.  The piper walked 
313 over to her and placed his hand on her head.  Immediately, she snapped all the
314 slack out of the rope and stood braced with all four feet, pulling on the rope
315 so hart that the halter nearly cut off her breathing.  Checking to see that she
316 had not recieved any injury, the piper stepped back to let her continue her
317 lessons about ropes and trees.

342      The viper soared across my starboard
343  port. As it did, it left a trail of Selerian oxide behind it.
344  From that I knew that the viper had taken
345  a direct hit. Now if I could just finish
346  him off before he returns inside the
347  outer limits of the base ship. If he
348  succeeds in returning to the comfort of
349  his own base ship, then all may be lost!
350  C.P. <Compu-Pilot> began reading interceptor
351  vectors to me. Maybe this was wrong? I
352  thought it might be the last of them.
353  Those pigs! They killed millions
354  in the Bentarus systems. I'll have to
355  kill him now, I thought to myself.
356  'Execute fastest intercept' I ordered
357  C.P.. 'Executing...', C.P. replyed.
358    As the viperer crossed my laser targeting
359  scanner, I knew that he was a dead man!
360  There would be no second chance for
361  this one. 'Arm turrants' I ordered C.P.!
362  Auto lock had him zeroed, (as usual).
363  I squeezed the trigger ever so gently.
364  For i knew in an instant that the
365  enemy would be no more.
366  As the trigger click, an enormous surge
367  of energy saught the target. 'KA-BLAMMMM'
368  The viper was shattered in mega-pieces.
369     'Head for home C.P.', I said.

403 I may not have been here as long as the rest, but I truly think that BW was a better place about last April.  I wish
404 that someone would tell me about some of the times BW has had...

406 Keri was just a small villiage, with just a small dock on a small lake...
407 But someone wanted that exact position... and was willing to kill for it.  Everyone.
408 Women and children cried as gouts of cold emerald force carved abysses into where their huts USED to be... and an
409 evil intelligence nearby just continued, and smiled...

414 PIPER: 
415 IT IS NICE TO SEE SOME DECENT WRITING HERE. IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE
416 THE ONLY ONE DOING ANYTHING AT ALL. ARE ALL OF THE REGULARS GONE?
417 ADMITTEDLY WHAT YOU ARE PROVIDING IS MORE REAL TO LIFE THEN THAT
418 GIVEN IN THE PAST, BUT AT LEAST IT IS ENJOYABLE, AND PROVIDES SOME
419 DEGREE OF ENTERTAINMENT.  THANK YOU.

421 [:::::PROMMETHEUS::] Cistop Mikey; I have been talking quite a bit to somebody from your past, somebody from before BW.,
422 stop sweating and calm yourself Dear Fellow, he calls himself Kulbe , Robert Kulbe.
423   I'm getting a ten megabyte tape drive from him, and saw me log on to BW and we started talking. Any messafges?
424                     Riskers; I would love to come, and will stock u@p on proverbs from near and far for the occaission

429    The piper released the calf after her extended lesson.  His arms were sore
430 and his waist seemed to have picked up a rope burn.  A quarter-mile is an
431 amazing distance to pull a reluctant beast -- but at least the last had not
432 been quite as bad.  Sweetie had (very reluctantly) taken a few steps at the 
433 half way point.  That first step had seemed like a major victory -- it made
434 the next ones much much easier.
435   He sighed as he leaned against the gate and watched the calf frolicing with
436 her mother.  Every day .... calf lessons, until she would lead where and when
437 he wanted.... He smiled at her playful antics.  How much better to teach her
438 now, rather than as a 1200 pound cow!

465            me explain ?  I fear I have missed a disk.
466 
467 Alex - Are you still interested in BBS type sequential risk ?  How about in person
468        type non sequential risk ?  Are you coming to NAPP ?  I can deliver there.
469        I am also interested in normal or nuke Risk, but did not see messages until
470        today, much too late.
471 
472 Mikey - As I said, I fear I have missed a disk or two.  Did you answer the inquiry

490 P.S. Zaphod, minding his own business, is suddenly struck in the back of his right head, knocking it off. His left
491 head mutters "og" and is promptly disconnected from the supporting shoulder.
492 Zaphods headless body drops to the floor, lifeless. His slayer raises his weapon and proclaims" "I am Vffn jhwt syn

498 Alex : I must apologize for zoning out at the Risk Game Saturday. Usually I can stay up until all hours of the
499 night, and not really be affected, but Saturday was another story. I think the missing VOL had something to
500 do with it, although I have no scientific proof. When the time comes for a rematch, I will be much more
501 prepared...
502 Voyeur : Well how was your first day of normal living, sleeping, and working? Not too tough on you I trust? Just
503 think, you'll have enough money to get a new computer and car in no time. But then what can I chide you
504 about? No more mazda jokes...what will I do?
505 NAPP goers : This Friday is the big day. What is the big time? 7:00pm? Does everyone have directions for getting there?
506 Let's all hope it doesn't rain this time. I don't know how many remember the last NAPP, but there was a tremendous
507 storm that dumped nearly an inch of rain that afternoon. For Portland, that is quite a bit for one day. Everyone think

537 "Piper, thy tales of calf training remind me of occurences long past.
538 At one time I lived upon a farm and had somewhat to do with such beasts."
539 "On the day in question, Andy had forgotten to close the gate to the
540 barnyard and the Jersey cow (a more foul tempered beast I hope to never meet)
541 escaped to the far pasture. 
542 As luck would have it she decided to calve BEFORE we could reach her.
543 *I* was elected to the honor of carrying the calf three-quarters of a mile
544 back to the barn.
545 Even newborn calves arec HEAVY. But even worse, the mother (who, due to
546 a MASSIVE oversight still possessed her HORNS!) had a rather strong objection
547 to anyone bothering the calf!
548 There I was staggering under the weight of the calf, while three other
549 people tried to keep the mother from "horning in". (Ouch, I cannot believe that
550 I actually SAID that)."
551 Ah yes, "the good old days"....
552 The apprentice paused and ordered a refills for piper and their friends 
553 at the table.
554 "I do not know if this makes any difference, but the calf's sire was a
555 'Cimmental'(sp?). This may have had some effect oin its size."
