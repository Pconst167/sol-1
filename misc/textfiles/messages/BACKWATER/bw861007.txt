26 Now is this really me?  I left no proof as to who I am.  I'm getting tired of
27 these stupid border games.  I wish my impostor would knock it off.  I think
28 the best course of action is just to ignore them.
29 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Darbon+++++++++++++++++++++++++
30 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
31 The reason I left no proof was because I was trying to ignore you.  This is
32 stupid,  it's like I'm talking to myself.  It is my turn to congratulate you,
33 you are doing a wonderful job,  it is very entertaining to watch you make a
34 fool out of yourself.  Thank god I know alot of the people here so all I have
35 to do is talk to them and tell them which entries are mine.  
36 KWH:  Proof:  Remember what I was telling you about this morning when you had
37 to go??  Yes,  it happened again,  at least with LZ,  and then MANY more times
38 with the likes of Eagles (Hotel Calif.),  and alot of Boston...  Proof enough?
39 Thought so....

43   The piper was alarmed but not terrified of the glowing apparition that
44 had risen from the glowing coals of his campfire.  After all, he had
45 calhed it -- at least in a manner of speaking.  His attention on the
46 flames had caused ~something~ to change.  He had seen pictures within the
47 flames, had felt stirrings of contacts that had long been closed.  He had
48 sensed the potential for tiny "bubbles" within the heat and had noticed
49 their growth when his attention was on them.  One particular bubble had
50 drawn his attention by its growth rate and sat before him now like a bird
51 on a nest of fire, seemingly stable, but strange and not fully tested.
52   For long moments the piper stared warily, ready to flee if threatened.
53 The glowing globe sat quietly, its surface shimmering slightly with the 
54 passing of a slight breeze.  At last, convinced that the strange
55 apparition presented no immediate threat, the piper moved closer to
56 inspect the glowing globe.
57 .pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
58   Odd, I had the same problems as with the last entry -- about 3/4 of the
59 way through, the file acted as though it were done, leaving the entry 
60 hanging.  A quick edit spliced things, though.  Oh, well....

64 Well, at least some one on this board
65 appreciates me. I try to bring wisdom,
66 truth and light (and humour) to this
67 board and I get nothing but derision,
68 catcalls and paradoxes. (I'd like a
69 pair o'doxies though. 
70    But not to worry, I am not going to
71 Seattle. Not yet at any rate. I'm
72 going to be around Backwater for a
73 while at any rate, and I'll still be
74 using an Atari to make my entries, because
75 it does annoy people with 80 and 120
76 column monitors. Now does anybody have
77 any better questions than "What came
78 first, the chicken or the egg?" Actuallyeveryone should know by now that the 
79 egg came millions of years before the
80 evoulution of the modern chicken.
81 (That is IF you believe in evolution)

153 From:  Sysop Tony Anderson 
154 Subj:  InfoWorld Article
155  
156 From Neil Shapiro, Sysop of the MAUG(tm) Forum:
157  
158 Many of you may have read the article in INFOWORLD about how CompuServe
159 lawyer's contacted BBS Sysop Steven Sande. Most of INFOWORLD's article
160 was based on allegations made by Steven Sande and INFOWORLD printed these
161 allegations as truth. The allegations made are simply not true. The facts
162 of what happened are as follows:
163  
164 1) CompuServe received a complaint from the author of a copyrighted
165 program that his program was being published by Sande's Mousetrap BBS without
166 the author's permission. The author also indicated that Sande had many other
167 non-Public Domain programs on his BBS. Note: Copyrighted program, not
168 a public-domain program.
169  
170 2) CIS asked me to call the BBS and verify the author's complaint.
171 Sande's short bulletin (signed with his nom de plume of "Captain Mac")
172 specifically stated that Sande was going onto GEnie, CompuServe and Delphi
173 every week to download all of their files and that if you sent him $25 to
174 join his service there was no longer any need to join any of the networks.
175 His short bulletin did not state he was downloading public-domain files
176 but said all files and specifically stated commercial redistribution.
177  
178 3) At the same point in time Sande left a message on MAUG(tm) also stating
179 that all files (not just public-domain) were being offered on his BBS. I
180 deleted that message and sent him an EMAIL reply explaining that many of
181 our files were copyrighted by authors and that it was unethical to take
182 such files without the authors' permission.
183  
184 4) CIS' lawyers sent Sande a note which did NOT ask him to close his
185 BBS but simply asked that he cease the illegal acts above.
186  
187 5) Sande left many messages on such networks as FidoNET claiming that
188 CIS had told him to close his BBS and that it was public-domain files
189 that were at issue. This is simply a misleading statement. CIS did not ask
190 him to close his board. The files at issue were copyrighted files which
191 CIS had received author complaints over.
192  
193 6) It is important to keep in mind that Sande's BBS was a commercial
194 venture. It is also important to keep in mind that Sande specifically
195 stated in his short bulletin that he was making network compilations of
196 data available commercially.
197  
198 7) CompuServe and MAUG are not attempting to "threaten" any BBS system.
199 BBS systems are the heart and soul of telecommunications. But the sysop of
200 a BBS must operate within certain ethical and legal guidelines. One of
201 these, as should be obvious, is that you do not use a copyrighted file without
202 the permission of the author.

214    Mr Darbon:  Don't try and trick us with your chidish babblings to your self.
215    We all know that no one is mimicking your sadly imfamous name.  Not even the
216    twits on this system would lower them selves to that level.  So please I
217    ask, go talk to yourself on another system.  Preferably on some system of
218    your own.  We have no sympathy for children who make themselves unwanted.
219    Thereby creating a situation where no one will talk with them, and they
220    resort to talking with themselves.

249    Dear all,
250 
251      That pathetic attempt at trying to mimic my writing was so badly overdone
252      that it worries me to think someone believes I write like that.  When I
253      flame someone I usually give all of the reasons.  You did not even pick
254      someone who I would normally flame.  In the future, if you would like to
255      mimic me, please do a better job.  You might ask Ultimate Intelligence
256      just how I write.  He seems to know everything.  H**l, for all I know,
257      he might be writing this.
258 
259    ...and it makes me wonder

343   It was warm, but not hot.  He could feel a faint warmth from it
344 radiating against his cheek in sharp contrast to the bite of the early
345 autumn breeze with its faint promise of ice.  Somehow insubstantial with
346 the air of eternity about it also, it seemed to shimmer with swirls and
347 swatches of color, sometimes speeding past, then slowing and reversing in
348 their unceasing motion.  Loosing his caution, the piper stepped closer to
349 examine this fascinating surface.
350   The art of scrying is ancient, indeed.  Practicioners use a smooth,
351 often transparent or reflective surface and stare deep within to liberate
352 their conciousness from the bonds that normally bind them.  Perhaps the
353 best known is the Gypsy fortune-teller who, staring into the crystal ball,
354 offers the subject of the reading a shrewd mix of practical psycology,
355 careful observation, and, perhaps, a few genuine glimpses into something
356 else (but rarely -- those who seek the future are usually the ones who
357 would recoil screaming if they could actually glimpse it).  We, whose
358 perceptions have been blunted bye assaults on our senses, can only imagine
359 how unusual surfaces fascinated and held the attention of those who beheld
360 them for the first time.  The piper, while not entirely unsophisticated,
361 (after all he had visited several technelogically-oriented world lines)
362 was a creature of his world.  He was used to picking out movement within
363 the shadows of vegetation, finding food and danger in the subtle
364 competition within the rigid rules of his ecosystem.  His first alarm
365 stilled by his curiosity, he stared, transfixed, at the unknown surface
366 before him and, enthralled, watched the surface seem to melt revealing
367 unknown spaces beyond.

413 Lady S.: Hi!  What's going on on Friday?  
414 All:  The p.s. after KWH's entry is false,  how do I know?  Because I entered
415 it as it was being dictated to me by him over my other line.  That's also
416 why it was right after my entry.

451   please, the last two disks have been pure, unadulterated trash! but come to
452 think of it, i never liked the old story disks of say a yaer or so ago.
453 to whomsoever posed the querie as to if we shall just become names in an old
454 dusty archive disk, the answer is a hunderd yes's. if its this bad now (or is 'bad' the word?) imagine another year. 5 years
455 or 20 years. 17 billion years. 5.2393 * 10^32 years. soory. but yes, we shall.
456 ADRIC: if you posed the question on the 5th force, which is supposedly similar
457 to gravity, i do recall reading a small amount on that subject roughly 9 months to a year ago.
458 i seem to recall that this force is about 1/10 to 1/100 the force of gravity. something about it applying either exclusively
459 to or stronger to objects of homogenous composition. i.e.- a pure glass sphere
460 would theoretically fall a little faster than a glass and plastic sphere. i have
461 not heard a lot about it recently. try the readers guide to periodical lit., they could have a ref (but under WHAT?)
462  ULTIMATE INTELLIGENCE: OK, YOU ANSWERED 2 OF MY 8 OR 10 QUESTIONS. AND COP OUTS ON THOSE. (AND JUST WHO THE HELL WAS THAT 
463 AWYER GUY TOO)? OK, new q's to be a'd:
464 
465 1) statement: i recall hearing somewhere that in atoms, either the electrons (or some other sub-atomic particle)
466 can either be determined to be moving at a certain speed, OR their location can be determined, BUT NOT BOTH AT ONCE by 
467 present mortal knowledge. do tell, u.i., either produce a formula, a verbal explaination that can be written in mathematical
468  notation (math is the only TRUE language, if it can even claim such!), or cop out on that one.
469 
470 2) after reading GOEDEL, ESCHER, BACH: THE ETERNAL GOLDEN BRAID (which is no small task, i highly recommend it for al
471 people interested in paradoxes or loops or in being totally blown away!), i have come across a hard to pin down
472 thereom in number theory, actually set theory, which i am having problems
473 rationalizing. please help. i shall not state the theory itself, known as "goedel's incompleteness theorem", (excuse the 
474 'umlaut-e' being expressed as "oe" but ascii has its limitations.), since you already know it yourself. if you would like 
475 for me to inform other patrons, so i shall. but could you provide me either a definite proof in math terms (i.e.-  sss0=ss0+
476 s0 means 3=2+1 but youll need much more than that!) either FOR or AGAINST the theorem. 
477  if you do either, may i have the compyrights, for either bit of knowledge will make the revealer very, very famous!
478  
479 3) what would one see if one was a)transparent and b)was able to place two infinitely long mirrors (with infinite reflection
480 capacities) together absolutely parrallel and with the reflective surfaces facing each other? 
481 
482 thanks for your help,
483    the doughnut man
484 doughnut-doughnut-doughnut-doughnut-doughnut-doughnut-doughnut-doughnut
485  p.s. for number 3- and what if said person stood between the two mirrors and looked into them, what would he see?

526      Dear All,
527  
528        This has gone far enough.  Don't you know that when you argue with 
529 fools, it is hard for the onlookers to tell the difference.  This has become
530 one step above grafitti, and only because you type it in with a complicated
531 peice of machinery.  Why not let anyone say whatever they like, and if you 
532 don
533 (it just doesn't like me) ...are saying.  Why don't you people start to act
534 e the intelligent people band together and quit name-calling?  This isn't 
535 Allow me to start over, as this machine keeps dropping key parts to what I
536 am saying.  Don't perpetuate the garbage around here by paying attention.
537 Instead, praise and critique what actually has content here.  This is the only
538 way that this mess will ever be cleared up.  Take the garbage to a board that
539 doesn't have to change the disks all the time.  The remaining conversation
540 and stories might not fill the disk so quickly, but it will once again become
541 worth calling.  For all who may be offended, remember, if you wish to 
542 contribute to this board, do so in a positive manner, and all will be well 
543 again.  Now, to see if anyone listens...
