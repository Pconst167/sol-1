43   As I walked slowly up the hill I tried to visualize where Raza was at this
44  oment. I suppose I thought the calling worked better if I could picture his
45  hereabouts in my mind. There was certainly no reason to think this. I had
46 no idea why it worked, it just did, or at least it used to. He was most
47 likely in that stuffy old office, with it's artificial light, artificial
48 air, and artificial chores to keep him busy. How could anyone stand it day
49 after day? It must be that the hum is affecting everyone's mind. I sure
50 can't stand to be around it, it's one of the reasons I live out here near
51 the bay.
52   I breathed deeply as I settled down in the shade of a tamarind tree. Some
53  f the fruits were almost ripe. Mixed with coconut they made wonderful
54 preserves. We always told the tourists that there were two kinds, the ones
55 with tart fruit and the ones with sweet fruit. Somehow they couldn't ever
56 find the sweet kind. The tart ones eaten by themselves would twist your
57 mouth into a knot.
58   Viewing the bay and the ocean from up here on the top of the hill always
59  ave me a thrill. I could see the color of the water change from white
60  hrough shades of aqua and brown to deep blue as I looked out past the reef
61 toward the open ocean. I sailed my boat out there almost every day to fish
62 along the coral ledges. From up here my eyes glided along like the pelicans,
63 swooping down the full length of the reef and back up here to the cliff top.
64 The sun had become a huge red and orange ball that peeked through the puffy
65 trade wind clouds, as they marched along the horizon. The day's warmth had
66 brought the frangipanni blossoms to full bloom and the air was filled with
67 their fragrance. Old memories of exquisite pleasure were stirred by the
68 scent. I gave a sigh of pleasure and began forming my mind for the calling.
69 Would Raza be able to hear it over the vibrations of the hum? If I could get
70 him to come up here to watch the sunset and look at the stars just one time
71   know it would clear his mind. I began to call...
72     
73 Guardian---Thank you so much for the encouragement. I was hoping everyone
74   wasn't bored to death, and too polite to say so. Being a new story writer I
75   appreciate the comments, both favorable and critical. I really enjoyed the
76   poem (song?). It touched on feelings I've had from time to time.
77 Leonard---Again, my thanks for steering me toward the Inn. Have you read any
78   of Dr. Lilly's work with dolphins. He has a more open minded approach.
79 The Jiz---The compliment is appreciated. I presume you know the episodes are
80   parts of one story & that the plural was a typo. The dreaded HUM goes on!
81 All---I noticed that my episodes are longer than the average so I'm going to
82   trim them down some. I don't wish to take up too much space. I enjoy all
83   the wonderful writing here and wish to leave plenty of room for it.

213 The trouble with bringing friends home from after work is that when they find out that you have a terminal and see you use it
214 THEY want to start using it as well... So I've let a few, with limitations. Otherwise the disks might go by at a fantastic

220 On the other hand, I hate to tell you that you've done it again... A temporary residant at The INN, when not down at OSU,
221 goes by the name of  "Luingil"  and uses the /\/\ border. Disgusting having to hop from border to border isn't it? Don't
222 worry to much about it, if you still can't find a uniqe border three tries hence, you free to go back to the ^^^^ if you 
223 wish.      The selections that you bring are a pleasure, and are welcome.     (I still haven't figured out how you pick 
224 ones that have some pertainance to my emotions, though.)     Keep 'em comin'!
225 All:     No, Jedeves is NOT one of my aliases. (Strange, huh?)

233 CISTOP MIKEY---What happened? Six of the lines in the last episode of the
234   Magen story have the first character missing. They were there when it was
235   entered. Has someone been messing around? ---Melissa
236 fred---Thank you very much. Aren't you the one who started the debate? I
237   enjoy reading the give and take even though I have nothing to add.
238 Synopsis of the Magen story for >   |_|_|_|_ (bars of the cage):
239   The story takes place on a beautiful, lush tropical island. Magen is a young
240 island girl, a free-spirited child of nature. Five years ago a visionary
241 experience dramatically changed the course of her life. Around that same time
242 the worlds across the sea impinged on the island bringing economic development.
243 Raza, Magen's long time friend and love of her life, has become a cog in the
244 wheels of progress. After being sent to a mainland school he has been made
245 supervisor of the new island power plant. Dixie, daughter of the wealthy
246 investment baron (also financier of the island development), has just arrived
247 for an island vacation. She is running her own number on Raza.  ---Melissa

249 ^^^^^  My goodness, another late night computer-commuter...   --->the Guardian
250 
251 NO, there's no one else here, Guardian.  
252 ^^^^^     Oh, I thought that there was. Gee, this is almost like CHAT. --->S
253 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
254    Melissa -- add my voice to the approbation you are recieving.  I am
255 enjoying your story immensley!  (Luckily I am vacationing in a different
256 reality where this clash of cultures does not happen.)
257   Another step to the "life" discussion.  Can machinery -- metal and 
258 electricity -- ever be considered "life?"  We have numerous cases of
259 artificial aids being necessary to sustain human life.  How distinct is the
260 combination of human-unable-to-live-without-aid and the support machinery
261 from a "normal" human?  Is this combination, human and machine, each
262 component dead without the other, alive and human?  Most of us would agree
263 that a person with a prosthetic is still human and alive, but let's
264 extrapolate a bit.  The trend in medical prostheses is to be able to take over
265 more and more bodily functions.  It is not inconceivable that eventually
266 50% 60% or more of a person's body could be replaced by prosthetics.  Given
267 this, as much of the brain is concerned with regulation of the body, much
268 of the brain's function may eventually be prostheticized into some form
269 of automatic control system.  
270   I believe you can see where this is going.  At what point, if we can 
271 eventually shed this fleshy corpus, do we cease being alive and human?
272 Indeed, ta major ethical issue is -- when does life itself cease?
273 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
274 ??? Aloha??? I'm sorry, I can't place the reference. ????
275 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
276 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (restated)
277 Or along the path you were taking, wouldn't "where" be a question with as much intrigue concerning ethics?
278 ^^^^^   CBBS - Aloha     649 - xxxx     was my reference.
279 It is quite a bit like CBBS-NW, and almost identical to PCS-CBBS. Once you log in, you will be on the main board (a;0).
280 But to go beyond mere appearances, the MIND of the system (o.k., sub-system) is on access level #1. At function, type "A;1"
281 and you will be on the Discussion/Debate segment of the board. I think access level #2 is simular, although I haven't read 
282 it yet. There are a lot of bends to the topics that have been brought up. Your most recent disertations (sp) are not unlike
283 those points/counterpoints tackled 'abroad'.  I just thought that you might be interested...

325 hand, he closed the door behind him.  The door was painted a clear white.
326 It contrasted with the dirty walls around it, made it seem strangely out

329 years of climbing and descending.  A drunken old man curled up in the

354 Gaius was swimming through molasses with Mount Rushmore strapped to the back of his skull. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.
355 His muscles strained against the viscous substance, he fought to work his way to the surface. Stroke, stroke, stroke,
356 he thought, If I don't drown I'm gonna have a stroke, stroke, stroke. It seemed a hopless task. He tried to stretch
357 for the surface, reaching his fingertips upwasr as if his salvation lay in breaking the surface tension that held 
358 him prisoner. As he fell short for what seemed the thousandth time, felt himself sinking back into the embrace of the
359 goo, he found that his hungry lungs could stand no more. Traitors to his every desire, they expanded convulsively,
360 and Gaius mentally prepared himself for a drowning death...
361 Cold, stale air filled his being, stinking of grease and mildew and old rubber. It was the sweetest thing he'd ever
362 smelled. He filled his lungs (so wise, those lungs) with the air once, twice, thrice...and opened his eyes. Or so 
363 he thought. I might just as well have left them shut, he thought, the view's the same. There was a rumbling noise,
364 a feeling of movement, and something cold against his left cheek. His head hurt. His arms hurt. His hair hurt. 
365 Once he had catalogued his immediate sensations he was able to focus his concentration on more general aspects of 
366 his environment. His arms hurt, apparently, because they seemed to be tied tightly behind him. He was in a dark, cold,
367 small (he thought as he tried to straighten and hit both head and feet), loudly moving place. Where? It came to him
368 that he was in the trunk of a car. How had he gotten here? The last thing he remembered was being the target of a 
369 laser-bearing drone. So what happened next? And where was he going now? He felt that he might have missed something
370 important...

383 Hello all! I have a piece from an outline
384 of a "Soap-Opera" type thing that I 
385 wrote awhile back. As for now, it is
386 just a description of the events that
387 go on, but if anyone cares, I will work
388 out a complete story. Nothing special,
389 but here goes, just to see if anyone's
390 interested:
391 
392 +++ Season One, Episode One +++
393     -----------------------
394 
395 Cindy Larson, Sue Clark, and David 
396 McPherson all work for Phil Jameson in
397 his small-town accounting firm. At night,
398 Cindy is secretly working as a prostitute.
399 One evening, Phil, out looking for a
400 lady, finds Cindy working and buys her
401 services. The next day she is fired from
402 her job. Cindy thinks that Sue knew about
403 her evening job, and encouraged Phil
404 to fire her. Cindy tried to file a lawsuit,
405 but her case wasn't strong enough. 
406    David, who has secretly been in love
407 with Cindy, tells her, and they have
408 an affair.
409 
410 (End, Episode One)
411 
412 Let me know if you think I should continue this in its present form, work
413 on making it a full-fledged story, or
414 just drop the whole thing. Thanks!

442   hello,I am Sarah or the Lady S. Yes,I really do exist.
443   About human v.s. animal intelligence/life: life and intelligence are not the 
444 same thing and emotions are different too. Amoebas are alive and can exhibit 
445 behavior which seem like emotions, but they are not intellegent.Humans (us, the
446  good guys) are alive,intelligent, and emotional. However, the argument seems 
447 to be about the spectrum between the two. Life is proved by the presence of 
448 DNA ,intelligence and emotions nobody knows about (if they do, they aren't 
449 telling ). I believe that we are more intelligent than any other species 
450 present or future; we won't let anyone else get as sma't as us. I don't know 
451 about other planets, the alleged spores on Mars are not comptition. 
452     I also believe ( bigot that I am ) that our emotions are more intricate 
453 than anyone else's. We have a habit of giving things we love our emotions.
454     Murder, well how to say this without getting enemies, I only believe it is 
455 murder when the victim is aware of thier life , and only immoral when without
456 good ( MY definition of "good" ,of course ) purpose.i.e. killing an unborn baby
457 to save the mother from phisical, intellectual, and/or emotional destruction.
458 
459     Ok,NET decifer this: a2l 'y m 2ds)(m  : No, I did not get that from someone
460  else; it's all my own. I'd show you another code , but it takes too much space
461 (she say's after having writen a 1,000,000,000,000 word entry ). 
462 That mesage isn't long enough. But in respect for time and space I shall depart
463 Tomarrow (if I can get on ) I'll leave a longer and fairer phrase.

469 L'homme: If the Level 4 is enciphered as I think it's enciphered, I believe
470 I'll bloody scream.  Simple, almost too simple.  Just wait 'till the end of this week when I can work on it again. 
471 This week, of course, is the Dreaded Semester Finals Week, and I have about 4 essays to write by Thursday.
472 I'm not going to bother writing down the last two Level 4 messages, they won't do me any good until I can finish
473 cracking the first 3 that I have...
474 My time constraints being as they are, and since I do have to go to school for 3 more final exams tomorrow, I'll
475 skip the entry for now.  Consider me unconscious.  (I nearly am, sitting here yawning at my terminal.)

478 L'homme: How about sometime early Feburary?  Can you think of a convienient date near then?  Do not worry if it is
479 a school day or not, I can get out if need be... Thanks again.
480 As for the disk, you're welcome.  Just don't let Chuck see the "title screen" of Graphics Basic.  He'd have a fit,
481 if I read him right.  Just sort of skip over that part, and show him the dissembled code.  I know there's the LINE,
482 DOT, TEXT, HIRES, and DIR commands in it... and more, but of course, the documentation seems to have disappeared.
483 +++++++++++
484 Life is the interaction between intelligent beings and other intelligent beings.  'Intelligence' is the relative 
485 term here, not 'Life'.  Find out what is 'Intelligent', and you'll know what 'Life' is.  Of course, we all can
486 recognise intelligence when we see it, but can you define it?  What makes up intelligence?  Something that exhibits
487 intelligence to a high degree can be called 'alive'.
488 Now that I've created a lot of enemies who will say I'm full of bat guano, I'll finish the job:
489 Is Backwater intelligent?  Not the system, the messages and the interaction between users.  Is it then alive in a 
490 special sense?

493 
494 Milchar:  Mere interaction alone is not sufficient for BWMS to be declared alive             since all things interact 
495              with their enviroment...all things decay and as they decay, they
496              release sub-atomic particles which change other particles.  I often             use this as a reason why my
497              programs don't act like they should: "cosmic rays must have ruined
498              the algorithm, Professor, since I always write perfect prorams..."
499              (prorams...programs) How about intelligence defined as the ability
500              to respond properly to affection?  An animal that allows you to 
501              pet it would therefore be intelligent, while something that growls              at you is not...of course, 
502              this may be a mere reflection of the "Prime Directive" of humanity
503              --survival.  An interesting(to me) side effect if my definition is
504              accepted:  What does this say about people who involve themselves
505              in disastrous love-affairs?  Men and women who continue in a rel-
506              ationship that harms that physically and/or mentally...

515      Jack and Tony were both working on their Lone Stars when the girls
516 showed up.   Heads turned as the finely dressed woman strolled thru the
517 bar.  Marci caught sight of Jack and motioned to Tina.  They first stopped
518 and the counter and ordered cognac.
519      Marci and Tina were executives at two competative firms.  Marci worked
520 for Peter Pan and Tina worked for Jiff.
521      Tina and Tony were at one time dating regularly and had remained close
522 friends. Thru Tina, Tony learned of problems devoloping at Jiff and had set
523 Jack to work hacking.
524      Marci and Tina were roomates in collage and had always been in contact.
525 They thought it ironic at first that they both had the same job handling
526 stocks and different companies.  But, now they had different idea's on how 
527 to use their knowledge.

529 Guardian:  Yes, Alex did comment receiving some information from you., but
530 the transmission was garbled, we both put our heads together and tried to
531 reach you but you must have been out of range. (or asleep, have real problems
532 getting messages to persons in REM state.)
533 la homme:  I do have quite a bit of experience with snow snakes, althought
534 the past couple of years i have been avoiding them quite well. Save a couple
535 of face plants into deep powder about a month ago.  how refreshing!!

538   Sarah (or would you prefer Lady S?)  -- My humble apologies, but somehow
539 two of my concerns are entwined in previous communications.  One is the question
540 of "just what in the world is 'life' anywhy?" and the other is "just what is
541 this concept we know as 'intellegence', 'sentience', 'self-awareness',
542 'conciousness', or perhaps in a non-religious way, 'soul?'".  I am coming
543 to the point where I believe that non-DNA based life is possible.  In fact,
544 I feel that in some cases, such diverse things as nations, businesses,
545 social organizations, computer programs, and thoughts all either are alive or
546 move perilously close to that razor's edge which divides the two.
547   On the other subject -- I firmly believe that animals are conscious and
548 self-aware (and vastly more intellegent that most people give them credit
549 for).  I have been raising animals for food for quite a while -- in part
550 because I have felt the ethical necessity for accepting the fact that I have
551 not chosen a vegatarian diet.  When I sit down to the table to eat a steak,
552 I know WHO I am eating.  This adds a dimension to that meal that is hard to
553 explain -- I can't rationalize away my personal responsibility for the death
554 of that animal.  Either I personally dispatched it, or caused it to be done
555 for my benifit (my preference, as less of the carcass is wasted -- much of
556 the non-edible internal organs are processed for hormone content and end up
557 in cosmetic preparations).  I have been literally bloody to the elbows
558 carving the corpse into meal-sized portions.  In addition, I know the life of
559 that animal -- and insofar as I can, I ensure that it is as happy as possible
560 while it still lives, and that its death is quick and painless.  A bite may
561 carry with it the memory of the first time that the calf tried to eat an
562 apple -- warm sunny summers in the meadows -- or the irritation and disgust
563 the creature caused when it tore down a length of fence.
564   However, I digress.  I know that animals each have a unique personality.
565 And, as I stated before, I feel that they are self-aware and much more 
566 intellegent than we realize.
567 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
568   Why must we define intelligence anyway?  It seems as if everyone is fuzzy on
569 the concept, that they make their own definitions.
570   Regardless of whether they're true or not, it seems this is futile with every
571 person making up his/her own definition of life.
572   Well, perhaps I am only debating this opinion since I must attend school in a
573 bit, but how about life being defined as having the power to imagine?

577   Great!  I make the big leap into the NET story line, and no one notices.
578 Have I missed the mark, or are new-comers not allowed to start into the
579 action?  Everyone claims that stories are so highly regarded on this system.
580 It is my personal experiance that one has to be a horrible writer or a 
581 social misfit ( such as Frank ( I've been lurking that long! )) to be
582 noticed by the population of BWMS.
583   Well, is it possible that someone of authority could tell me if I'm 
584 wasting my time trying to get in the story.  If so, I guess I'll debate or
585 go back into lurking mode.   Sigh...
