28      The Inn seemed cold and dark. The fire in the hearth had been 
29 allowed to go out, and the cold wind blew eddies of dust about the 
30 floor. The Innkeepers footsteps echoed off the walls as he crossed the 
31 floor. Pulling the worn curtain aside checking the backrooms for 
32 patrons, but no one was there either. No notes to fellow travelers and 
33 friends tacked to the back wall. No cheery shouts of joy lost in revelry 
34 celebrating past adventures. Only empty scared tables and a golden 
35 locket to remind him of times past. Where had all those brave souls 
36 gone? 
37      Where were the brave knights, the fair maidens? Where were the 
38 wizards, echantresses, and dabblers of the art? The merchants and 
39 travelers and friends of old? 
40      Returning to the hearth, he threw a couple of logs on the grate, 
41 and with a handful of kindling and a candle, started the fire going 
42 again. Maybe some weary traveler or old friend would have need of it's 
43 warmth.  Winter seems to always take its toll of friends. Pulling a 
44 chair up near the newly built fire, the Innkeeper settled back to read a 
45 book and wait.  For the door was always unlocked for those who sought 
46 entrance.

49                                       part 2
50  
51                While driving through  the  city  traffic  to  the Pickwick,
52           which was  of course  still many  miles away since the air porter
53           had to drop of  other passengers  at different  locations all far
54           from the  Pickwick, Ted  had more time to contemplate. Instead he
55           stared out the window as the wonder of  the city  unfolded before
56           him. San   Fran   sure   was   big. It  was  a  lot  bigger  than
57           Enterprise. Of course Enterprise is  pretty small,  only a couple
58           thousand  folks  live  there. Enterprise  is  most famous for its
59           Boy's single A football team, and for being named after a ship in
60           that sci-fi show, even though Enterprise the town was around long
61           before Enterprise the space ship. But San Fran, what  a city! All
62           the street signs have funny writing on it, oriental like. And the
63           buses don't make  any  sound,  they're  electric. They  get their
64           power   from   those   wires   that  are  strung  out  above  the
65           street. Passing through a residential area, Ted  got a  look at a
66           typical San  Fran house. It  was like looking at a rainbow, every
67           house was a different  color; pastels,  strong primaries,  no two
68           alike. They reminded  Ted of  fir trees,  so tall  and thin, they
69           looked like mansions from  the outside. Ted  didn't know anything
70           about the  insides. People everywhere,  even at this hour. People
71           walking, stopping, talking, looking,  shopping,  eating,  so many
72           people.
73  
74                The  driver  told  Ted  to  get ready, that the Pickwick was
75           coming up. The streets were a little  grimier in  this section of
76           town. And  the  vagrants;  the  sheriff  ran  them out of town in
77           Enterprise, but Ted had seem them  before in  trips to  Boise and
78           Portland. They were  all over  the place  here, and  since it was
79           sunny, the  drifters  had  shed  most  of  their  multi-layers of
80           clothing. Ted didn't  think too much about this as he stepped off
81           the porter onto the sidewalk in  front of  the Pickwick Hotel. He
82           thanked the  driver, who looked a little funny at him, slammed to
83           sliding door shut, and sped off leaving a cloud of  foul smelling
84           exhaust fumes in Ted's direction. Ted shrugged, and taking in the
85           sights around him, gazed at  his  new  home  for  the  next three
86           days. To Ted  at least,  the Pickwick  didn't seem like to bad of
87           place. It reached up  into  the  sky  before  him,  at  least ten
88           stories high. That  would make  it the biggest building in all of
89           Enterprise, and here in San Fran  is was  just another hotel. The
90           building looked  rather old,  the architecture  seemed just a bit
91           out of place next  to some  of the  other buildings  Ted had seen
92           during his ride through town. The corners of the building all had
93           intricate sculptured work, and it  looked  like  there  were some
94           words  next  to  the  fancy  workings, about 8 floors up, but Ted
95           couldn't make out what the words  said. The sight  of Ted staring
96           up at  the Pickwick  must have been a comical sight, because soon
97           Ted was no longer standing alone, several people  had joined him,
98           and they were all looking up too.

117 I picked a pound of thistledown
118 And put it in a basket.
119 Then I cut an old pine tree
120 And fashioned me a casket.
121  
122 I gabbed a rick and smashed the clocz
123 And threw time in a bucket,
124 Then lay back to dream awhile;
125 From there gn in I'd luck it.
126  
127 I tried to play most every day
128 And hear the sound of lauther;
129 Figgered I'd just live awhile,
130 Not worry 'bout what's after.
131  
132 For many years I cried round tears
133 And smiled when things were rosy.
134 I just flgated in life's breeze
135 And never got too nosy.

149 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\34
150    Damn him! Why did he have to be so stubborn? And why did she care so much, anyway? Will was still on shift, and
151 Tariya sat alone in his apartment, thinking.
152    When she had walked out on James, she had truly intended to never see him again. Half an hour later, her resolve
153 wasn't nearly so strong. A strange longing developed, and she became increasingly nervous. Was he all right? What was
154 he doing now? She wanted to know.
155    At the beginning she hadn't especially cared for him. He seemed shallow, crude, irresponsible. As time went by, she
156 learned she was only partly right. He had scars that ran deep, and he covered those scars by being constantly
157 insulting and on the defensive. He never said that but she had gleaned this from their talks. His life had been a long
158 series of hurts and dissapointments. Maybe he was entitled. Maybe.
159    The incident with the gun was something else. There was no excuse for it. In the end, however, he had been the one
160 who had paid. In blood. After her initial anger had cooled she realized this. He had risked his life to save her
161 twice. He had protected and comforted her when she lost hope. Probably he had done it out of guilt, rather than for
162 any other reason. There had been times, though, when she wasn't so sure.
163    Oh, damn it all! Maybe she should just go back to Kadan. Any desire to do more adventuring had been worn out a long
164 time ago. But the thought of going home alone held no appeal at all. Why? The answer was simple, honest, and sitting
165 right there in front of her, but every time it came up, she would deny it in her mind, in her heart. It had to be
166 something else.
167    And if he cared, where as he? He knew exactly where she was staying, and there was nothing to keep him away. If he
168 showed up right now to apologize, she would accept it without question. Even if he didn't apologize, she'd probably
169 still forgive him. But, she decided, he had to come to her. She wasn't going begging to him.
170    Two hours later...
171    Well, maybe not begging, anyway. At least she should check up on him. As badly hurt as he was, something could have
172 happened. A spell of location, like the one she used at the Crystal Palace, only not as powerful.
173    She sat cross-legged on the floor, concentrating. The image came much more easily than she expected. A meter wide
174 sphere of golden energy foated in the air in front of her. It shone like a small sun for a second, then cleared,
175 leaving a three-dimensional image, complete with sound.
176    Tariya gasped.
177    The image showed a black box, the size and shape of a coffin. Three men were loading it into the cargo bay of a
178 small warpship. At one side of the picture was a three-eyed alien of a type she had never seen before. He looked like
179 a monster. He was talking to someone she couldn't see. "wE lEAvE In An hOUr. OUr cArgO mUst ArrIvE As qUIckly As
180 pOssIblE. nO OnE mUst knOw Of thIs. NO OnE."
181    The shock broke the spell and the image exploded with a loud bang, making her jump. She sat numbly, trying to make
182 sense of what she saw.
183    Was he dead? Where were they taking him? And dammit, why wasn't there somebody here to take charge? She needed
184 help, fast. Willerd? No, she'd never find him in time. The ship was leaving in an hour, and there would be no way to
185 trace it. Whoever had him would be gone forever.
186    She was on her own.

189   The winter sky was close and cold.  The piper, his plaid wrapped tightly
190 about his shoulders, shivered as the wet branches raked his bare legs
191 between hose tops and kilt bottom.  His panting breath made miniature
192 storm clouds that the relative wind of his passage blew back into his face,
193 bringing moisture to his eyelashes.  Of course it was condensation, not
194 tears, leaving his cheeks wet, sweat from his exertions explained the
195 salt taste on his lips, didn't it?
196   He stopped a moment and scanned the sky, feeling hemmed in by its nearness.
197 His clenched hand held a large white feather, larger by far than that of
198 any bird with which he was familiar.
199   Nothing.  The bare winter branches of the winter-stripped trees wrote
200 unkown runes of natures calligraphy across the cold sky.  The silence was 
201 complete, no whisper of animal motion, only the rasp of air in his lungs.
202   Defeated, he stood a long moment, then turned to make his way back to the
203 comfort of the inn.
204   Several hours later, the low blocky form of the inn stood before him,
205 its ancient, scarred door the only barrier between him and the hospitality
206 and fellowship within.  Shivering and cold despite his prolonged exertions,
207 the piper lifted the latch with one hand and shouldered open the heavy door.
208   After the light of the afternoon, the dimness of the great common room
209 was like momentary blindness.  His chilled skin was greeted by the warmth
210 of the crackling blaze in the great hearth, his nose brought him the 
211 pungent smell of burning wood where an errant draft had forced a wisp of
212 smoke into the room.  He stood for a long moment, grateful for the warmth,
213 waiting for his eyes to adjust.
214   As his eyes grew used to the dimness, the piper noticed the quiet.
215 "Odd," he mused to himself.  "No one seems..." he stared around the room,
216 taking in the empty tables.  "Where is everyone?"
217   He walked down the low stairs towards the hearth, then became aware
218 of the innkeeper dozing over a book.  Walking softly, the piper carefully
219 placed another log on the fire, walked back of the bar and drew himself
220 a mug of the inn's nut-brown ale, blew out the inkeeper's candle that was
221 guttering perilously low, and sat in silence to enjoy the warmth of the
222 fwinter fire.

231         "Brrrrr!!! It's cold here Parity! And I forgot to pack my long-johns."
232         "Now I told you it would be cold before we left HQ. I told you it would
233 be cold when we were on the plane. Now you see for yourself Fellows. Don't say
234 I didn't tell you so."
235         "Naay, you didn't tell me so!"
236         "So much the child sometimes Fellows."
237         "Ahh, you kw I act that way just to bug you Parity. Sometimes you
238 just have to say, 'What the heck!'"
239         "Over there." Parity pointed to a blue 74 Chevy Nova parked just off
240 the runway. "That is our transportation."
241         "Geez, you would think we would at least get Ram-Tough or something."
242         "Don't fret too much Fellows. We will only be using that car for a
243 couple hours. Remember level two of our visit here to the great white North."
244         "Of course I remember Parity, but it just isn't any fun if I don't
245 get to bitch about something, right?"
246         "Yea, sure, come on."
247         Dhe two agents made their way to the car. It was a standard police
248 vintage Nova with few minor adjustments, the least noticeable of which was an
249 intricate communications system tucked away in the glove compartment.
250         "Nice, real nice," mocked Fellows. But before Parity could admonish
251 him for his sarcasm, the glove compartment comm-link sprang to life. The
252 comm-link's electro-plasmic display went from dark red to a bright pink
253 sprayed with clear white letters.

263 onto a piece of paper. "What do you think that means Parity? This isn't
264 our standard code. Do you think HQ messed up?"

306 NOE: Yes, the long the delay the better if you are having problems
307 with the download the best approach if you can do it is to wait for
308 each character you send to be echoed back to you.
309 The problem is that the character you send is echoed by BW, and if you 
310 send another character down the line while the first one is being echoed,
311 they can collide and cause problems on poor phone lines/modems.

362      Time passes on...  perhaps I shall as well.  The vail of creativ-
363 ity that once would cover my consciousness is no longer at my command.
364 I  continue with my daily routine and constantly wonder if the face of
365 the  one that is my preoccupation still thinks of me as often as I  do
366 of him.
367      It  would be him I'd thank for having made me look at  the  world
368 with  a  new vision.   It all started with my curiosity as to  why  he
369 constantly  carried around a small writing book and funny colored pen.
370 To my question of why, he would give rise to creation.
371      "It's  an escape,  I can get away from my classes without  really
372 having to leave the room." I've seen him do it before, too.  he'd pull
373 out the book and pen and go off into his own little world,  scratching
374 notes along the way.   I liked the idea;  the next day I went out  and
375 bought two of those types of books to write in.
376      Since  that time we've had a falling out.   I didn't write in  my
377 book  anymore  at the time.   I'd given up on reminding myself of  our
378 dualistic relationship--he meant everything to me but I didn't care to
379 face him anymore.   How could things have changed so much since I  met
380 him?   Back then I couldn't wait 'til next we met, then this transfor-
381 mation...
382      After the falling out,  of course, came the lonliness.  I eventu-
383 ally  came to realize that I missed him,  and he told me he missed  me
384 too.   It was great;  it made me feel so relieved.   Getting back  to-
385 gether  was  the  hardest part,  I think we're still working on  it  a
386 little.  The three thousand miles that seperate us isn't helping much,
387 but I still think of him alot.
388      I keep a candle in the window for him, if that matters.  We're so
389 far apart,  I hope he'll recognize it as time passes.  I'll just drink
390 my wine in solitude and pray for that day as I write this...

470 What is this bloody thing about getting into NET? What is the big deal? I thought is was some group of people who wrote spy
471 stories. I don't see why anyone would be so hot and heavy to get into it. Write yourself in, be an enemy, or leave it
472 alone. Continued comments about smoulders in my heart and fire in my mind make me think you are taking this stuff way
473 too seriously. NET schmet. We don't care to hear the problems about getting into or getting out of. This is a writer's
474 board, please keep it that way, ok?

490 A present for my brithers and sisters
491 
492 Here's a present you can fit in your pocket
493 or put up on the wall.  Or down in the bucket with the trash
494 as an elegant garbage, something over-wrought in its details, 
495 like a sand-castle with prisoners in the tower
496 and the tide rising at the end of a hot day.
497 In all that sun, who could blame you if you 
498 with your own hands smashed the thing down
499 before the waters could reach it, knowing there's no love
500 in the water, the way it piles on itself to move.
501 
502 We've worked on something together for years
503 and didn't even know what it was until it started floating away,
504 buoyed by the sea but about to drown in it.
505 How long can a man swim in water just over his head?
506 How long will he care about himself and want to save it
507 before his mind lulls and offers thoughts that soothe
508 like seaweed around the ankles?
509 
510 It was supposed to be a day at the beach.
511 Life was to be harmless.

515     A BRIEF DISPOSITION OF THE NATURE OF "THINGS"
516  =============================================
517 .
518    "Things" are just about what they seem to be: ie.
519 "things".  "Things", being what they are, seem to be just
520 ecuse they tend to stay that way.  If some "thing" were to
521 change, it wouldn't be the same "thing".  Every "thing"
522 nges; some "things" just don't change very quickly.
523 Things" have always been that way, and they probably always
524 will.  There is really not much you can say about "things".

527 To person above in regard to Pam, actually, it is the last couple

530 if anyone has seen her since the weekend.

533 hi

536 It has been eons since I have called my favorite of all BBS's. In fact, I 
537 uld say that this sytem was responsible more than anything else in my getting
538 my own board. It is good to see that nothing has really changed. Since
539 those early days since I first started modeming, I have moved from a small
540 system to a large, 300 to 1200, Floppy to Megabytes.. you get the drift. It
541 is good to slow down and take it all in at 300 baud...

552 flowing.  I've been at a low ebb for quite awhile myself.  I'll try to work
553 up something in a day or two.  Feel free to mix in or sit it out as the 
554 spirit moves you.  
555   All:  The image of the inn is a consensual reality.  If the consensus
556 flags, the image grows thinner and less compelling.  Perhaps (and I
557 appeal mostly to the "old-timers") we could re-establish this reality
558 so that the newer folks do not unwittingly violate it.  C'mon now folks,
559 what's the use of having a Roman Bath for a rest room if nobody uses it?
