MESSAGE #2: AT LAST-CODES
MSG LEFT BY: THE ROGUE

Here are some Metrophone codes hacked out 8/26/84. They have *NOT* been used. 
 432119     432131    432221   432224	 432240    432249    432255
 432259     432267    432279   432287	 432296    432304    432308
 432341     432353    541179   541237	 541241    541247    541313
 this should keep you phreaks goin for a while.Remember to be especially 
careful when using codes given to you by someone else! (How many phreaks do you
think are FBI?)

I have been told a strange thing. It is: MCI doesn't trace. Now, this can't be 
true, right? who cares, I use Sprint!
