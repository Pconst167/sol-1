Why limit yourself? Why not Egeanin or Amys? I don't think  
we have EVER had either of those names picked and both are  
quite interesting characters. Since the boards are free for 
the next few days, I'll post everything I have on WOT. Be   
sure to export it all!  Moiraine

Whew! That was some compilation. And you're right. Why go   
mainstream. From now on, call me Morsa. (The Seanchan

character.

 So true. But the problem is, no one remembers who Morsa is.
    Oh well, better to remain floating in the shallows      
    than to drown with the crowd in the depths....
