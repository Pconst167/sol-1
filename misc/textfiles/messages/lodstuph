LOD Communications: FYI The Underground BBS Message Base Archive Project
 
This is a limited distribution message sent out to a select group of people
to inform them of the above mentioned project. This message or portions
thereof may be used as an AD in the near future. For now, It is For Your
Information.
 
   A significant portion of now retired computer underground participants
(hackers and phone phreaks) have expressed interest in seeing all of those
old messages they posted on various underground hacker bulletin boards during
[7m-- more --[m                 their 'career'. This is especially the case for those who never downloaded
the messages; sold, gave away, or chucked their disks; and those who were
visited by law enforcement officials who TOOK EVERYTHING including those
suspicious looking toasters 8-/. In addition to this crowd, those who have
come to the 'scene' relatively recently are keenly interested in what their
'forefathers' talked about and what computer systems and networks they were
into. This interest, and the growing curiosity of the general public to know
what all those 'hacker kids' were REALLY up to (starting World War III of
course!) is the reasoning behind this undertaking.
 
   Basically, we are creating a Historical Library of the dark portion of
Cyberspace. Throughout history physical objects have been preserved for
posterity for the benefit of the next generation of humans. Cyberspace
however, isn't very physical; data contained on floppy diskettes has a finite
lifetime as does the technology to retrieve that data. Most of the
underground systems operated at a time when TRS80's, VIC-20's, Commodore
64's, and Apple //'s were state of the art. Today, it's difficult to find
anyone who has one of these machines in operating condition not to mention
the brain cells left to recall how to operate them :(.
 
   The aim of the project is to acquire as much information as possible which
was contained on the underground hack/phreak bulletin boards that were in
[7m-- more --[m                 operation during a decade long period dating from the beginnings (1979, 80 -
MOM: Modem Over Manhattan and 8BBS) to the legendary OSUNY, Plovernet, Legion
of Doom!, Metal Shop, etc. up through the Phoenix Project circa 1989.
Currently messages from over 50 different BBS's have been dug up although
very few are 100% complete. Not having a complete 'set' does not diminish
their value however.
 
   The adventure began in late November of 1992 and the first Listing of
completed message base files is anticipated within the next few weeks.
Periodic updates will follow as more data is procured. As happens with most
projects, the effort and monetary investment turned out to be substantially
more than originally anticipated. Literally hundreds of man-hours have been
spent copying dusty apple ][ disks, transferring them to IBM (or typing in
hard copy versions when electronic versions were unavailable), organizing the
over one thousand individual files according to what BBS the messages were
originally posted on, splicing the files together, and a very slight editing
of long distance access codes and computer passwords -- to help ensure that
there is nothing illegal contained within the messages. In addition, the
monetary investment is approaching $1000.00 for the above mentioned tasks
which also include snail mail costs, phone bills, equipment costs, etc. This
figure does not include a monetary estimate of all the man-hours spent during
the life of the project.
[7m-- more --[m                  
   In order to at least break even, a dollar value has been attached to each
set of message bases. The dollar values were determined based on the
following conglomeration:  the number of years ago the BBS operated, its
popularity and message content, and the total number of messages compiled.
The prices were kept as low as possible ranging from $1.00 to $9.00 for each
Copyrighted (c) 1993 by LOD Communications, H/P BBS message base set. Each
File includes in addition to the messages themselves: a historical background
and description of the system, any tutorials aka "G-Philes" that were online
as well as downloaded userlists if available. Due to the economics involved
in diskettes, snail mail costs, and filling orders, a minimum order of $20.00
is required. The files will be available in IBM (5.25 or 3.5 inch), Amiga,
and Apple MacIntosh formats and orders are expected to be received at the
requestors mailbox in 2-4 weeks. Paper versions can be ordered but cost
double (many messages are of 40 column format and therefore wastes lots of
paper) and take twice the time to deliver.
 
   There are a significant number of individuals helping in this project.
Some have done typing, some uploading, some just trying to locate their disks
and files. Gaps exist in many message bases...sometimes months at a time,
some popular systems' messages have yet to be recovered. Those who may have
downloaded messages or printouts may want to contact us. For those who may
[7m-- more --[m                 have material to submit, an equal amount of material will be given freely to
contributors. 
 
   Over the next month word about this project and advertisements will seep
into cyberspace and traditional print sources. From all indications, there is
a very large demand from all types of people for the kind of information that
is being collected. A wide dissemination of this information will hopefully
provide those who were not part of the underground to experience and learn
what it was all about instead of relying on those often slanted (negatively)
accounts found in the press.

 call the switch and do what I said

[7m-- more --[m                  call the "frame" #, and say "Hiya, 
 this is Bob Lineman, could you run
 into the MDF, and try to activate the
 call forwarding on NNX-XXXX? send it
 to NNX-XXXF, please, I need to check
 it out from both ends..." then, hook
 your computer up to the payphone that
 NNX-XXXF is, and set up a simulator
 for the login to that system. When you
 have it in your pocket, call the frame
 back and say "Hi, me again, would you
 just disengage the forwarding on that
 # for me? I've got the problem, but I
 need it recieving calls to fix it.."
 then you can re-hack it later if you
 want by just calling the frame again
 in a different shift..

like one reason that destroying a system
would be better than learning to use it's
"special" features.  If you want to get
your face on Newsweek, go ahead, but
otherwise, don't start destroying stuff
just for the sake of vandalism!  Instead
of being a vandal, do somthing Robin
Hood-ish, like nice the parent process
of the batch runner to -20 or somthing.
 Or give everyone full privilige
to / or make them all user 1.
 
Otherwise, as for metro tracing, that's
kinda hard to swallow.  Would whoever's
freind's sister care to elaborate on that
one?
 
[7m-- more --[m                 I don't know if anyone cares, but I had
a chance to take a look at those
"goldphones" and Geez!!!  there were
codes written all over it!  I don't 
understand some people very well.  That
is simply stupidity. 
There is really nothing "new and exciting"
in phreaking anymore...  most of what you
hear is bullshit from some twelve-year-
old that just learned how to use metro last
week.  There is simply no "new" anything!
Eventually there will be, but until then
these "phreak" boards will simply be
"how to phreak"--tutorials instead of
journals.  Drat!

  Karl Marx brough up an interesting co
ncept....
Now for my interpretation....
THERE IS   A  lesson Oin phreaking and 
hacking morality:
 
  I find it truly discouraging when peo
ple, intelligent people seeking
intellectual challenges, must revert to
 becoming common criminals.  The fine
arts of hacking and boxing have all but
 died out.  Though you newcomers, you
who have appeared on the scene in the l
ast year or two, may not realize it,
we had it much better.  People didn't r
ecognize our potential for 
destruction and damage because we never
[7m-- more --[m                  flaunted it, nor did we exercise it.
For hacking, it was the intellectual ch
allenge which drove us to do it.  The
thrill of bypassing or breaking through
 someone's computer security was
tremendous.  It wasn't a case of gettin
g a password from a friend, logging
on, and destroying an entire database. 
 We broke in for the challenge of
getting in and snooping around WITHOUT 
detection.  We loved the potential
for destruction that we gave ourselves,
 but never used.
  Today, after so much publicity, the f
un has turned to true criminality.
Publicity we have received is abhorring
.  From WarGames to the headlined
October Raids, to the 414's, the Inner 
Circle, Fargo 4a, and the recent
NASA breakins--not to mention all the l
ocal incidents that never made the big
newspapers, like breakins at school com
[7m-- more --[m                 puters or newspaper computers.  TRW
credit information services claims hack
ers used the three stolen accounts
to aid them in abusing stolen credit ca
rds.  The thrill of entering and looking
around has shifted to criminal practica
lity--how can I make my bank account 
fatter--how may I use this stolen credi
t card to its fullest--how could I
take revenge upon my enemies.
  And then there is the world of Phone 
Phreaking.  The number of phreaks
has grown from an elite few, perhaps te
n or twenty, to well over a 
thousand.  Still, there remain only abo
ut 10 or 20 good, longlasting
phreaks.  The rest receive information 
and abuse its uses until the information
is no longer valid.  Even worse, they s
eek publicity!  They WANT to be caught!
Many even use their real names on bulle
tin board systems to promote publicity.
[7m-- more --[m                 Meanwhile, the REAL phone phreaks have 
been resting in the shadow of the rest,
waiting for phreaking to become so dang
erous as to become a challenge once
again.  Once security tightens and only
 the strong survive (phreak Darwinism?),
phreaking will be restored as a way to 
'beat the system' without costing
anyone anything.
  Hacking may soon be dead, but may pho
ne phreaking live on!

O.K., that message that Doctor Who
described was almost correct. When
you dial 0110, you get a satellite,
if you dial 0111, you will get a
cable connection. The satellite is
not quite as good as a connection as
the cable, but still quite good. I find
that a simpler way to box is to seize
the line with 2600 HZ, then dial
KP+NPA+182+ST. This will give you a
tone. You then enter:
[7m-- more --[m                  
KP+Country+City+Number+ST. In some
places, you must dial 0 before the
country code. In other words, to call
Spain, which has a country code of
34, you would have to dial 034. I
know that one good line is 
KP+914+182+ST. I called my friend who
is on vacation in Spain with it, and
got a good connection. Still, it is
easier to use a good overseas extender,
if you have one available.

69> COSMOS & UNIX
---------------------------------
 
Msg left by: BIOC AGENT 003
Date posted: MON AUG  6 11:18:23 AM
 
 
COSMOS is basically a modified UNIX sys
tem.  When a non-priviledged COSMOS
user logs on, a program usually called 
/BIN/PERMIT is run.  This tells the
system which COSMOS commands the user i
s allowed to use.
 
On the other hand, when a priviledged u
ser logs in (ie, root, sys, bin, or
preop), he is put into the normal UNIX 
shell (SH) where he can utilize
UNIX commands such as:  who & cat /etc/
passwd (which will printout the 
[7m-- more --[m                 password file).  These users can also t
ype CHDIR /USR/COSMOS and use ANY of
the COSMOS commands since COSMOS is rea
lly a sub directory in a UNIX system.
They also have a bad (good?) habit of l
eaving administrative notices and files
(such as the decrypted passwords) layin
g around in different directories of
the system.  In fact, one system down i
n Washington, DC has a BIN account
with no password (!) until some ASSHOLE
 decided to change the message of the
day"I broke in, ha, ha  --Joe Smuck"!!!
 
If you can't get into one of the privil
edged accounts then you might as well
try for a regular COSMOS account.  The 
typical setup is two letters followed
by 2 numbers.  Here are a few common on
es:
 
 
[7m-- more --[m                 TRxx (TRaining -- eg, TR01, TR02, etc.)
LSxx(Lac Staff)
LA   (Line Assignement)
FMxx (Frame Manager)
NMxx (NAC Manager)
RSxx (Repair Service)
LMxx (LMOS debug)
etc...
 
You best bet would be too go for one of
 the managers accounts such as NM01.
There is also usually a user-name of CO
SMOS on the system.
 
The passwords are usually pathetic.  Tr
y things such as:  COSMOS, FRAME, TELCO,
etc.)  Also try simple words such as:  
CAT, BAT, RAT, etc.
 
You'll have to guess at the Wire Center
, though (WC).  It will always b 2 
letters.

Ok what the program "C PW Scanner",  or
 "The C Search" does is fairly 
simple. It reads through the main passw
ord file searching for a match between 
A person's name and password and compar
es the two. If they match, or if
a person's pw is simply his name spelle
d backwards. it will write the 
pw's into a file name of your choice. T
his should net you several paswords
[7m-- more --[m                 for every scan at least. The percentage
 of stupid people on any given 
system is usually quite high. The entir
e search should take about 5 mins.
Obviously it can't do too much consider
ing everything is crypted...
 
The entire program is internal, and ass
umes you have at least one accnt.
allready present on the system in quest
ion.
 
Instructions :>
     Pretty simple, all you do is: Uplo

WAS the MF01 act. they were using)

PHONE FIEND & OTHERS WHO WANT TO BUILD BOXES...
I'VE SEEN BLUE BOXES THAT USE 555'S.  EVEN THOUGH THEY
PUT OUT A SQUARE WAVE, YOU CAN TURN THIS INTO A TRIANGULAR
WAVE BY PUTTING A CAPACITOR ACCROSS THE OUTPUTS (AUDIO).
ALSO, IT MAY JUST WORK AS IT IS, THOUGH PROBABLY BETTER
WITH THE CAPACITORS.  
      SINCE A SPEAKER OR MOUTHPIECE CAN'T REPRODUCE A
SQUARE WAVE EXACTLY, THEY TEND TO ROUND IT OUT A BIT.  
FEEDING A TRIANGULAR WAVE THROUGH THIS MAY WORK.
I CAN'T BOX WHERE I LIVE, BUT I'VE USED A TI-994A AND
C-64 THAT SENT OUT SQUARE-WAVE OUTPUTS.  BY PUTTING A
CAPACITOR THAT WAS LYING AROUND, I COULD DRIVE A SPEAKER
DIRECTLY THAT WOULD LET ME TOUCH-TONE DIAL.  GOOD LUCK!

CHEESE BOX: Basically lets you set up your own loop, with one dif-
ference: there is no charge to the people calling.  If you are at
[7m-- more --[m                 a payphone calling one of these things and talk for less than 3
minutes, you will get your money back.  I don't know where they work
any more, but I thought I'd mention it because I found a source for
the critical component: 56V Zener diodes; Mouser Electronics sells
them (619)449-2222.  Here's how to build one:
 
You have two phone lines, each with Ring & Tip leads (red and green).
When the phone is on-hook, the voltage across these leads is 45V.
When the phone rings, it goes up to 90V.  You connect the Zener diodes
across each pair of ring and tip leads; this prevents the voltage
from going above 56V, and the phone company thinks the phone has
been answered, but the voltage goes back to 45V because the phone
is on-hook, and the call seems like it was never answered.
 
To connect the two phone lines together, connect ring to ring and
tip to tip with a  0.5 micro-F capacitor rated at 100V.
 
You can use this with two phone lines, or as many phone lines as
you want.  Each phone line will have the Zener connected across its
two wires.  To connect multiple phone lines, each ring lead must
be connected to capacitors going to every other ring lead.  Same for
the tip leads.  So if you want a 4-line loop, you would need eight
[7m-- more --[m                 capacitors and four Zeners.

MESSAGE #29: GREEN JUSTIFIED
(SPACEBAR QUITS MESSAGE)
 
MSG LEFT BY: PETER MCIVERS
 
I guess a green box is called that because green is the color opp
osite of red,; a red box simulates coins at one end, and a green
box returns them at the other.  Besides, the people who first thought
of it decided to call it a green box, in some issue of TAP I think
in 1981.
      I don't know why a white box; I've thought of it myself.  I
would think because white stands for pure and good, and a white 
box (Touch-Tone) seems pretty harmless.  A gray/silver box (same
thing) has been influenced a bit by the dark side of the hack, but
not totally??  Well, maybe.  Any other ideas?

THE LIST COMPLETE.
 
YELLOW BOX: ALSO CALLED A MUTE BOX.  THIS IS JUST A 2600

GRAY BOX: THIS IS A WHITE BOX WITH THE AUTOVON ROW INCLUDED.
             THE FREQUENCIES ARE:
             1677 + 697: FO (FLASH OVERRIDE)
             1677 + 770: F  (FLASH)
             1677 + 852: I (INTERRUPT?)
             1677 + 941: P (PRIORITY?)
             THESE APPEAR BESIDE KEYS 3, 6, 9, AND #, RESPECT-
             IVELY.
PURPLE BOX: THIS IS A COMBINATION RED/BLUE BOX...
BROWN BOX:  THIS IS A COMBINATION OF MORE THAN ONE BOX.  IT
            IS USUALLY A COMPUTER LIKE AN APPLE ][ OR C-64
            OR TI-994/A THAT CAN GENERATE BASICALLY ANYTHING
            YOU COULD DREAM OF.
GREEN BOX:  THIS WOULD BE GREAT IF ONE COULD BE BUILT &
            DESERVES ITS OWN MESSAGE (TO GET ATTENTION); SEE

GREEN BOX: A DEVICE THAT LETS THE CALLED PARTY CONTROL
           COMPLETELY THE PAYPHONE OF THE PERSON WHO
           CALLED HIM BY SENDING THE SAME SIGNALS AS
           AN OPERATOR DOES DOWN THE LINE.  THESE SIG-

2)  1300 + 1500  OPERATOR ATTACHED--DISABLES KEYPAD
                      (FOR COIN DEPOSIT)
3)   700 + 1100  COIN COLLECT (YUCK!)
4)  1100 + 1700  COIN RETURN  (YEAH!)
5)   700 + 1700  RINGBACK
6)  1500 + 1700  OPERATOR RELEASED/COIN COLLECT COMBO.
 
THESE CODES WERE IN THESEPTEMBER 1982 BELL SYSTEM
TECHNICAL JOURNAL.  THE ARTICLEIS ON CALLING CARD
SERVICE & IS PRETTY INTERESTING.  AMONG OTHER THINGS,
[7m-- more --[m                 IT LISTS THE BLUE BOX CODES AND TELLS HOW TO USE THEM!
THIS IS MA BELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!
 
     THE ARTICLE SAYS THERE IS AN 'ALERTING WINK'
FOLLOWED BY ONE OF THESE MF TONES (NOTICE SIMILARITIES
WITH BLUE BOX TONES -- COIN RETURN IS THE SAME COMBINA-
TION AS KEY PULSE).  I THINK THE ALERTING WINK IS A
2600 PULSE.  THERE WAS SOME WORK ON THIS IN AN ISSUE
OF TAP SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING
ELSE ABOUT THEM.  ALSO, THE NUMBERS 1) TO 5) STAND
FOR THE NUMBER OF 'ON-HOOK WINKS' USED IN THE MULTIWINK
SIGNALING VERSION OF THE SIGNALS ABOVE.  THE MULTIWINK
I THINK IS WINKS OF 2600, AFTER AN INITIAL 2600 WINK.
COMBINATION 6 IS JUST USED IN THE EXPANDED INBAND 
SIGNALING SYSTEM, WHICH USES THE MF TONES ABOVE.
 
      IF ANYBODY KNOWS HOW TO BUILD A GREEN BOX, I
WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT.  IF NOT, I HOPE THIS INFORMA-
TION WILL HELP SOMEBODY ELSE WORK ON IT.  IF ANYBODY
NEEDS A COPY OF THE WHOLE ARTICLE (IT'S 40 PAGES LONG,
BUT 2 PAGES WOULD FIT ON AN 8-1/2 X 11" SHEET), LEAVE
ME E-MAIL AND WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT.

MESSAGE #13: ETS DLUP
(SPACEBAR QUITS MESSAGE)
 
MSG LEFT BY: PAUL MUAD'DIB
 
According to the "Electronic Switching
Systems No. 1 ETS Dial Up Data Link 
Control Program" dated June 9 1980,
written in EPL, (ESS Programming Lang.)
each ESS#1 has a direct-dialable data
link into the central teletypewriter.
The dialup will respond with a prompt,
the "security message", then wait for a
PW. They are only 4 digits long. DON'T
type a letter, there are special alarms
rigged for that. 
There are up to 64 "dlup clients", so
[7m-- more --[m                 the keyspace is weak, (1 to 64)/10^3.
If you get in it will respond by typing
a client ID and clock read, e.g.:
"WP CCIS NETMAINT 21:01:34 JUN 3 1984"
 (for an imagined client, "White Plains
  CCIS Network Maintenance")
and give you a systems prompt. From
there, you will be in total control
of an ESS#1. It allows 5 tries before
dropping you, and 10 minutes w/o typing
before logging you off. I don't know
any baud rates, but the ESS PUC, 
(Periheral Unit Controller, off of the
 ESS's call store buffer) passes data
to this subprogram as 7bit ascii w/o
lower case. It ends some lines of text
with the ASCII char EOT, which may lock
up your modem. There are apparently no
backdoors in this subprogram, but it
seems that the entire security index
is based on a pointer, "post-login",
which is zerod when you're in. If you
[7m-- more --[m                 get a dialup, try doing timing-related
security code digit entrys, ie type 1,
wait some even multiple of 440ms (the
frequency with which this routine is
called) and typing 0..it may possibly
fuck up some pointers, and zero you in.
The system is UNIX-like, and naturally
the best place to be is "root". 
EPL is very complex, If anybody has any
info on ESS, drop me a letter.
  later,

   About the last message, definitely not.
 
  Concerning Sir Knight, remember all, he has most of our phone numbers
(family and personal), so we can not do something as simple as turn him
in.  Several suggestions have been made though.  We could:
 
1)  erase his mother's credit rating (Eric was stupid enough to tell
us that his ma has a credit card.
 
2)  Mail a tightly packed can of cockroaches to his house.  When he opens
it, they will crawl everywhere.
 
3)  The classic: mail a dead fish to his house.
 
4)  Blackmail (find his friends & his personal secrets) (he found our
phone numbers)
[7m-- more --[m                  
5)  Verbal anonymous threats (we've already given him a dose of those)
 
6)  Bill conferences to his line.  Since he has the phone numbers of so many
people who hate him, he won't know who did it.
 
7)  Bill third-party calls to his line.
 
8)  Bullshit his CO to give out his credit card number, or have them send
a card to his 'son at college'.
 
I'm open to suggestions.
 
Necromancer,
I see you alot on Mark's (313) board, is there a shadow knight acct there?
 
To whomever I gave my school's account and passord to,
you did a very good thing: you logged in on Friday night--when I had

  Since you mentioned that there is another Necromancer floating around, I

Since about 10 months ago, dozens of 'little Big Brothers' have been
popping up EVERYWHERE!  There is easily one per region (they frequent
local-loser boards).  If any of you know of any of them, or know any that use
any major BBS's, please let me know about them.  This is really pissing
me off now that every goddamn Sophomore English teacher is making her
students read Ninteen Eighty-Four and little losers 'find an idea for
a good new user name'.  If it is any consolation, I even have verbal permission
from 1984's publisher to have exclusive use of the name....
