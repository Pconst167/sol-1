One of my friends zeroxed his birth certificate, altered the name on the
copy, and rezeroxed it.  Then he left it outside for a few days to let it
age.  He then went to the DMV and got a CID with it.  I would not recommend
doing anything illegal such as this, because it is dangerous and dishonest.
But under the first admendment I felt like I had to warn you.

Title : Tennis Ball to open trunk of cars
     >> This message has 1 reply

I was watching some local news program on the subject of car crime. They said
that using an ordinay auto tool that the window of a car could be broken with
very little noise. They said they did not want to say the name of the tool or
show it clearly because they did not want to encourage other to try, but they
did demonstrate. I was impressed. The breaking window was VERY quiet. Sounded
like some gravel being crushed. I got the impression that the tool was
something like an ice-pick or screw driver that was poked into the window.
This made a tiny hole which then caused the rest of the window to fragment
(tempered glass, you know).

Also at the end of the program when they came back from a comercial one of
the news anchors was laughing and said "Well, Emeral has just described how
an ordinary tennis ball can be used to open a locked trunc. But of course we
wont describe how to do that either. HA HA"

Does anyone know how a tennis ball can be used to open a locked trunk? I am
curious.

Both the tennis ball and glass tool are using applied pressure.  However I
think the tennis ball is a random method while the glass tool is
calculated.

Title : Re: Tennis Ball to open trunk of cars

They may call the glass in cars "tempered," but tempered glass is hard as
steel and can't be broken with an ice pick or anything of the kind.  It can't
be cut with typical glass cutters, in fact it has to be heated to be cut at
all.

The glass used on cars is some sort of sandwich with plastic in the middle to
hold the fragments together and keep it from splintering.

I suggest it's time to DEMAND that car makers use TRUE tempered glass in
their windows.  Tempered glass is the kind required for safety code in retail
store doors.  I once had a storefront with regular plate glass in the door
(which got broken on Halloween).  I replaced it with tempered.  You can hit
the thing with a hammer and it just bounces.

Someone once broke a window on my old rambler without making a hole in it. I
got into the car, and when I slammed the driver's side door all the glass
from the opposite window fell down on the seat.

This glass doesn't bend.  It's just like steel.  Doesn't bend at all.  It's
in use everywhere, otherwise stores would get broken into all the time! It's
required by building codes after about 1965.  The stuff comes manufactured in
specific sizes and doors have adaptor moulding to make it fit properly, since
your ordinary glass company can't cut the stuff.  It's in use everywhere. 
It's called tempered glass, but it's not the auto stuff. Why don't we demand
it in cars and trucks?  Where's Ralph Nader?

I'm coming off a bit pissed, since my vehicle gets broken into about twice a
month.  The last time was night before last.  I never carry anything of
worth, cept a handtruck in it, figuring nobody's gonna walk off with that and
try to sell it on a street corner.  I guess I'm tired of being ripped off.

Screwdrivers, or any strong pry tool, can dislodge the door locks on most any
japanese car.  These locks are strictly a formality.

This happened to the previous owner of my car.  The passenger side door lock
has crinkled metal around it ... but if somebody tries to pry it out again
they'll find that my repair is considerably stronger than the factory
installation was.

Palestinians are the only real enemies of all true anarchists. they give
Anarchy a bad name. Violence is only usefull if its random and senseless.
They're too goal oriented, we must stop them before they ruin our good name.

fucking skanky fucking hairy bush.  I don't want no perfume down there.  I
want SALMON!"  Even though "The Day the Laughter Died" is a lame Dice album, I 
found a good use for it.  Next time you're bored and you have a loud stereo,
try that and dry out everyone in your neighborhood!

    Video Games are easy to open if there is no bar across the front of the
money box door.  Take a screwdriver, put it in the crack on the side with the
lock, and pop open the door.  It's pretty easy, and video games have a
shitload of money in them sometimes.  I got $200 in quaters out of one once! 
Make sure you have like 8-10 friends standing around you when you do it so no
one sees what you are doing.

I d/led CHAOS a little while ago. About half the stuff in there is useless
shit, especially the box information. You see, the files were written about
siz to seven years ago when the phone company still ran on some analog
equipment, they're all useless now with the digital networks out there now.
For example, the black box used to keep the voltage level on your line up so
the phone company never thinks you ever picked up the phone. None of this
works now. I found the chemical bomb stuff interesting, though, especially the 
colored smoke screens. What you should do is delete the file and I'll
upload the edited version. I took out all the outdated files and renamed themn 
into something intelligible. Believe me, I was around in the good ol' days
when you could call anywhere for free and never get caught...

It seems like some of you are into anarchy, huh? I have been collecting
anarchy files from all over the place for about six years now, and have built
quite a bit of knowledge of the years. I will leave one of my favorite ways to 
get revenge on someone (or a whole lot of people) which is legal, wont hurt
anyone seriously, or cause lots of property damage (although the
ol-drano-in-the-gelatin-capsules-trick-in-the-gas-tank is good if you REALLY
are pissed off.)

Once, some assholes in school slipped acid into my friends soda, and he didn't 
know about it. If you have ever taken acid, imagine what it would be like if
you've never taken it before and didn't know you were on it. The poor guy
thought he was going crazy. Either way, I was pissed off and had to get
revenge. One night, these assholes and their friends had a big party because
Mommy and Daddy went away for the weekend. So we waited for everyone to get
pretty drunk, slipped in, and poured about six bottles of ipecac syrup in
their big punch bowl, stepped outside, and watched the fun. I'd never seen SO
many people throw up at once (it looked like the scene from Stand By Me!).
Their house was completely covered with puke from inside out.

If you need to get revenge, I would recommend this, although you don't have to 
do it on such a large scale. Ipecac is very sweet, pour it into any sweetened
drink like cola, coffee, fruit juice. Doing so will make the victim yuke like
they never have before...

Yesssss... I've built several bombs myself... A tennis ball bomb is the least
effective -- it requires quite a bit of force to ignite...  What I'd like to
know is how to get CHEMICALS!  Most txtfilez are not too conclusive about
this...  The average person cannot buy through a chem catalog, cuz they will
only sell to schools... Believe me, I've tried it before.  Just some potassium 
nitrate would be good enough for me... But it's hard to get ahold of... Anyone 
have ideas??

  A friend of mine is kind of into destroying things, so I usually print out
these t-files at work (CHAOS, ANARCHY, HARASS etc.) and work on a laser.  Some 
of these are actually pretty interesting, but it seems they were all taken
from the Poor Mans James Bond and the Anarchists Cookbook.  I saw Poor Man's
James bond for $33 in a mail order catalogue, can I get it anywhere else
cheaper?  How about the Anarchists Cookbook?

Try Carolina Biological Supply for some chemicals. I believe you can find
their number by calling 1 800 555 1212. I prefer to stick with the household
equivalents, its alot easier to run down to the drug store or supermarket
than wait a few weeks for a package..

What about saltpeter?  I asked the loser at "Great American Drug Store", and
he either had no idea what I said, was a complete idiot, or they really didn't 
have it...  Which I doubt.  Besides gasoline/cholorine or bleach/ammonia mixs, 
and other easily obtained substances, I found the best thing (that works) is a 
combination of epsom saltsdrug store) and sugar... not terrible destructive,
but produces lotsa (LOTSA) smoke....  As for Carlonia Bio, I have several
catalogs, but don't they only sell to schools?

Maybe CBS only sells to schools, but don't let that stop you. Just say that
you are the chair of the science department at said school district, or a
teacher or whatever. The first thing is to learn is that companys NEVER check
up on you. I always fill out cards to music equipment and electronic magazines 
under "Purchasing Manager" for a bogus company. You wouldn't BELIEVE how
gullible they are, and the deals that they will send your way.

I have a shit load of BLOCK-BUSTERS.  I'm selling them for $1.50 each or 20
for $25.  Also, I'll sell you a gross of them for $120.  

If you go to Chinatown they'll charge you $2.00 EACH (very little less if you
buy in quantity).  And the blcokbusters they have are weaker than the ones I
have.

If anyone wants blockbusters and you respond before 1pm on the 4th, I'll drop
the stuff off at your house (or somehwere else) if you don't live too far.

So, what did everybody do today?  Whoops... I mean yesterday, technically... 
A coupla friends and I tied sup. blockbusters to brick and tossed 'em through
car windows -- Cool, but the damn alarms piss me off -- louder than the damn
fireworks...  We had several launches of ashcans (m-80's) tied to several
dozen bottle rockets...  Cooif you tilt 'em and shoot it through a window... 
Good thing not too many people were home last night...  Oh, well --- what did
everybody do?

To KB: Did you try that smoke bomb?  Ours worked perfectly!  Totally covered
most of the block in smoke...  Shit, though... We had to drive away pretty
quick, cuz a match ain't too long a fuze... Ah, vell

I tried making some of those smoke bombs but they didn't work.  I did what the 
textfile said to do and I did make the gel like stuff... but the shit would
not light?!?!

Oh well... for the 4th I went to Throgs Neck Bridge.  There were hundreds of
people all along the shore of the East River.  They had some really cool shit, 
like 8" mortars.  After that we just went around having fun with about 3
grosses of M-80's and a lot of blockbusters.  A cool thing to do is to put a
blockbuster on top of a 16oz rocket (take out all the color shit).  Then
launch the rocket down a street or into a house.

That's cool -- where'd you (or wuz it they) get 8" mortars?  I've been looking 
for one to launch pineapples -- perfect size...  THe smoke bomb didn't work? 
Strange...  Our's required a bit of coaxing, but it did work...  Sometimez I
don't know about these textfilez, though...  That tennis ball bomb thing
doesn't work one bit...  I had to light the damn thing myself -- it's supposed 
to ignite when thrown... oh, vell...  There are alot more powerful things than 
a coupla packs of matches, though <grin>

there had a bunch of them.

It works PERFECTLY if you have the necessary tools:

    1) A checking account and ATM card.

What the method does is uses YOUR checking account as a template to figure out 
(and steal from) someone else's from the same bank.

    2) A CIS intro pack.

Beyond that, it's virtuall foolproof.

Sorry if I didn't make that clear (if I had someone else's ATM and PIN, I
wouldn't be hacking CIS account, if ya know what I mean!). What you need is
your OWN ATM for a checking account. It uses the information on your checks
and on the ATM receipts to decode another person's account number. If you need 
yesterday's newsday, there is an artice about check fraud. Apparently my
techniques are gaining popularity!
