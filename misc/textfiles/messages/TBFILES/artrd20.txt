Just a question:  Why don't you just use Yann Cleroux Artic Reader.  It will
convert up to 70pages of ascii text (with word wrap) into a MECCA compilble
text.  You can have a article title at the top, and pageup, pagedown (+ and -
keys) q- to quit Goto Page, and even tag for download.  No [reg. only]
capablitly....its great!  Fre'q ARTRD20.ZIP anytime, anywhere 2400-14.4 !
