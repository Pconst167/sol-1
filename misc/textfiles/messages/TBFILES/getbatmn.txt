MB>        I have a version of GET, not sure which version, but the /w
MB>command doesn't seem to work.  Do you know where I could get the

 To check the version, type GET all by itself at the DOS prompt.  You
 should see an abbreviated list of GET's command and options, and the
 very top line should report the version number.

 As for the "/w" command, it's not a command per se.  It's a "switch"
 which is optional with many commands.  The one I had suggested in that
 example was:

 GET C /W600

 meaning: wait for any "C"haracter but only "/W"ait up to "600" seconds.

 This works for me in versions 2.5 and 2.61 (I'm pretty sure 2.4, which
 I've seen on a couple of shareware CD-ROM's, also supports GET C /Wnn)

MB>versions you specified or where I can get Batchman?

 If you can do "freq's" then the BBS at the origin below has GET25.ZIP.

 Batchman is in a PC Magazine archive:

  V09N02.ZIP     59392  01-11-90  PCMag BATCHMAN BATSONG INFO DRIVINFO

 Good luck.
