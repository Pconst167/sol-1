  TB> Hello.  I was just thinking today and I think it would be a good idea 
 TB> to have a Maximus BBS list.  They have it for Wildcat, TriBBS, and 
 TB> RBBS-PC, so why not for Maximus?  I would like some volunteers to help 
 TB> with the project but I do not think it would be impossible to do.

Good idea. Step 1: Create a "blank" form so that everyone's entry is in a
standard format. Actually, there's a standard format already developed by one
of our sysops down South. He wrote all the software so that the listings get
processed automatically, and can generate telix etc. dialling directory files
straight off the listing. PLUS He's written a "list browser" especially for
Maximus.

Contact Daniel Ayers (3:770/140) and ask about his BBS-list software. He might
like to be involved in this project!
