Hello Kyle!
 
Freeware assembler: VALARROW.ZIP
Shareware debugger: ZD86-101.ZIP
ASM source code   : 80XXX.ZIP
Interrupt list    : INTER42?.ZIP
 
The assembler is a public domain clone of MASM 3.0, the debugger
has features similar to Borland's debugger. The source code is
a collection from the 80XXX echo and the interrupt list is an
excellent four-part work from Ralf Brown. You are looking at a
couple of megs.
 
Fido f'req them from 1:346/15 or call in Human-like to
1-509-536-7260 and download them from the BBS.
 
You can also file request via Internet email and you will be sent
UUE'd mail on the next run. Send a message like this:
