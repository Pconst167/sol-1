Hello Elizabeth:
EA>Hello Earl, this will be my 2nd summer camping.  If you do have some
EA>camp cooking recipes to share, I would much appreciate them.  Many
EA>thanks and good luck with the article.

Guess I started camping about 60 years ago before I started walking. I
came from a camping family before camping became fashionable. Of course,
all the places we camped when I was a kid are subdivisions or resorts.
Anyway, to me any recipe can be a camping recipe, but the criteria is
tasty, easy and calls for as few pots as possible. Crock pot recipes are
great for camping if you have a (white gas) Coleman (the propane ones
need to be refilled too often). Of course, you need a covered pot, too.
Just set the flame down low and let your dinner cook all day while you
fish, swim, boat or communicate with nature.

Here's a recipe to try:

Hello Again Elizabeth:

Before leaving home, plan every meal. If you are going into the
wilderness take food for every meal. Even the greatest fishermen in the
world have bad days.

Do everything possible before leaving home. Pre-mix spices, pancake
batter, etc. and store in zip-lock bags. If you are going backpacking,
you need a different approach. You'll have to think light & compact.

Not too much low-fat stuff around here, although both Fido and PlanoNet
have Low-fat echoes if your sysop can get them.  I bought some
WonderSlim, a fat substitute, at Whole Foods (a health-food store) the
other day and made fat-free muffins this morning that are the FIRST my
husband has pronounced acceptably moist.  But WonderSlim was NOT cheap.

In the meantime, here's a tested low-fat recipe:

MMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.01

      Title: Thai Chicken with Rice
 Categories: Poultry, Low-fat, Thai, Tested
      Yield: 4 servings

MMMMM-----------------COPYRIGHT UNCLE BEN'S 1989----------------------
      2    Chicken breasts
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Oil
    3/4 c  Rice, long cooking
      1    Garlic cloves, crushed
      2 c  Stock, chicken
      2 tb Peanut butter
      2 ds Pepper flakes, red
      1 c  Snow peas
    1/2 ts Ginger, ground
      1    Bell peppers, red
      1 tb Peanuts

  Cut bell pepper into short thin strips.  Combine boneless chicken and
  soy sauce in shallow bowl; set aside.  Heat oil in skillet over
  medium heat. Add rice and garlic; cook and stir 1 minute.

  Stir in stock, peanut butter, and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil,
  stirring until peanut butter is melted.  Place chicken over rice
  mixture, adding soy sauce to skillet; reduce heat.  Cover and simmer
  until 5 minutes before end of cooking time on rice package.

  Stir in snow peas and ginger; sprinkle with pepper strips.  Remove
  from heat. Let stand, covered, until all liquid is absorbed, about 5
  minutes. Sprinkle with peanuts.

  I didn't have snow peas, so used regular frozen peas.  I also used a
  green bell pepper instead of a red pepper, and the color was kind of
  blah -- if serving this to anyone who pays attention to the
  appearance of a dish, the extra cost would be worth it.

    INGREDIENTS ------------------------------------------------------------

                      Texas Dry Rub - see recipe                        
       1        Tbsp  fresh lime juice                                  
       1 1/2    Tbsp  Madeira wine                                      
       3        Tbsp  olive oil [use extra-virgin]                      
       1        whole beef brisket - 4 to 5 pounds                      

    DIRECTIONS  ------------------------------------------------------------

        Combine the rub, lime juice, Madeira and olive oil in a blender.  
    Process until it becomes a smooth paste.  Or combine the ingredients  
    in a small nonreactive bowl and stir into a paste.  Scrape the paste  
    from the blender or bowl.                                             
        With your hands lightly oiled, rub the paste into the brisket,    
    coating both sides well.  Cover the brisket with clear food wrap and  
    marinate for a minimum of 36 hours in the refrigerator.               
        Remove the brisket from the refrigerator and let it sit at room   
    temperature (for about 1 hour) before you begin to cook.              
                                                                          
    TO COOK OUTDOORS, use a covered kettle grill or water smoker.  In a   
    kettle grill, indriectly cook the brisket over a water pan containing 
    a basting liquid of water, orange juice, wine or something similar for
    about 2 hours per pound, refreshing the coals with damp smoking chips 
    every couple of hours.  The brisket should have a dark crust when     
    finished.  If you are using a water smoker, follw the manufacturer's  
    instructions. Remove the brisket from the grill and let it stand for  
    10 minutes before slicing.                                            
                                                                          
    TO COOK INDOORS, preheat the oven to 200F.  Put the brisket in a      
    roasting pan and place in the center of the oven.  Roast for 2 hours  
    per pound, undisturbed. Remove the brisket from the roasting pan and  
    let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.  If you like, combine the pan
    juices with some warm barbecue sauce for serving.                     
                                                                          
        To serve, slice the brisket across the grain.  Place overlapping  
    slices on a large platter, drizzle with barbecue sauce and garnish    
    with grilled red onions rings.                                        
                                                                          
    Yield:  10 to 12 servings.                                            
                                                                          
    Author's note:  The trick behind a perfectly moist beef brisket is    
    slow, even heat or smoke.  If you have a water smoker and access to   
    mesquite chips or hard wood, Texas beef brisket takes on added depth. 
    But you can get nice results indoors with your own oven.  The Texas   
    Dry Rub becomes the basis of a smoky, savory paste.  Serve the brisket
    with your favorite barbecue sauce, a side of coleslaw and a garnish of
    sliced, grilled red onions.                                           
                                                                          
    Note from me:  We us this recipe on a 3.25 pound eye of round roast  
    and marinate in the refrigerator for 72 hours or more.  Delicious!  The rub
    iss very hot, so I rub it off the roast before 
    slicing so there is no overkill on heat.  We usually serve two sauces on
the
    side:  homemade BBQ sauce and horseradish sauce.  Great with baked     
    beans and homegrown tomato salad!

Servings: 4

HHH-----Bundles===========================
4          boneless, skinless
           -chicken breast halves
1/4     t  salt
1/4     t  dried oregano leaves
1/8     t  pepper
1          garlic clove, minced
2       oz guava paste*
4          thin slices cooked ham
1/4     c  fresh cilantro, finely
           -chopped
1       T  oil 8       oz can Pillsbury
           -Refrigerated Crescent
           -Dinner Rolls
HHH-----Sauce=============================
6       oz guava paste*
1/4     c  dry sherry
1/2     c  chopped fresh cilantro
1/2     t  beef-flavor instant
           -bouillon

*Guava paste is available in Mexican & Spanish groceries.  If you
cannot find it, you can substitute the same amount of jellied
cranberry sauce.
Place one chicken breast half between 2 pieces of plastic wrap or
waxed paper. Working from center, gently pound chicken with
rolling pin or flat side of meat mallet until about 1/4" thick.
Repeat with remaining chicken breasts.  In small bowl, combine
salt, oregano, pepper and garlic; mix well.  Sprinkle evenly over
chicken breasts.  Form guava paste into four 2 x 1/2 x 1/2"
strips and place one on each ham slice.  Spoon about a
tablespoonful of cilantro over each strip of guava paste.  Fold
ham around guava and cilantro to form a roll. Place one roll on
narrow end of each chicken half; roll up, jelly-roll fashion.
Secure with toothpicks.  Heat 1 T oil in skillet over medium
heat; add chicken rolls, seam side down.  Cook covered for 6
minutes or until no longer pink, turning once halfway through
cooking.  Remove toothpicks.  Place chicken on paper towels; pat
dry.  Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Separate dough into 4
rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal.  Place one chicken
roll on each rectangle.  Fold dough over chicken; press edges to
seal.  Place, seam side down, on ungreased cookie sheet.  Cut
slits in tops to allow steam to escape.  Bake for 13 to 18
minutes or until golden brown.  Meanwhile, in small saucepan over
low heat, combine all sauce ingredients; cook and stir until 
guava paste melts.  Simmer until sauce thickens. Place chicken
bundles on serving plates; top with sauce. Garnish with
additional cilantro, if desired. Serve immediately. (2/3 cup
sauce)

      Yield: 1 servings

      1    Text Only

  Use two cups of blanched whole almonds. If only unblanched almonds are
  available, blanch them this way: Place the almonds in a saucepan and
  cover with water. Bring to boiling, then drain. The skins should slip
  off easily when you press each almond between your thumb and
  forefinger. Dry on paper towels. Spread the dry almonds in a shallow
  baking pan and toast in a 300 degree oven for about 20 minutes or
  until golden. Cool for 5 minutes before processing or blending.

  To process: Place the steel blade in your food processor or blender.
  Add the nuts. Cover and process or blend until a butter forms,
  stopping occasionally to scrape the sides of the bowl or blender a
  few times. Keep processing for three to five minutes or until all of
  the mixture is evenly blended. Process about two minutes more or
  until the butter is the desired smoothness.Store in a covered
  container in your refrigerator for up to two weeks. Bring to room
  temperature for easier spreading. Makes about 1 1/4 cups.

      Title: Peanut Butter Cookies
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 24 servings

  1 1/4 c  Flour
    3/4 t  Baking soda
    1/4 t  Salt
    1/2 c  Margarine (l stick)
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
      1 ea Egg
    1/2 t  Vanilla

  Stir together flour, soda, and salt.  In a mixer bowl beat butter for
  30 seconds.  Add peanut butter and sugars; beat till fluffy. Add egg
  and vanilla; beat well. Add dry ingredients to beaten mixture; beat
  till well combined.  Shape dough into 1 inch balls; roll in
  granulated sugar, if desired.  Place 2 inches apart on an ungreased
  cookie sheet; crisscross with the tines of a fork. Bake at 375 for
  9-10 minutes .
   Cool about 1 minute before removing to a wire rack.
   Makes 48. For an alternative, do not crisscross with a fork. Simply
  cook as directed.  Upon removing cookies from the oven, place a
  chocolate candy Kiss in the center of each cookie, unwrappped of
  course.
   Press slightly and cool completely.  You can wrap cookie dough into
  a 1 inch ball around a candy kiss and cook as directed. This gives
  you a cookie with a chocolate center. This is also another great
  alternative.

      Title: Soft Pretzels
 Categories: Bread, Yeast, Snack, Boat
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Very warm water
      1    Envelope active dry yeast
  2 3/4 c  Sifted, all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter, softened
      1 tb Sugar
      4 c  Water
      5 ts Baking soda
           -Course salt
 
  In a very large bowl, sprinkle yeast over the cup of very warm
  water (105 to 115 degrees).  Stir until dissolved.   Add butter,
  salt and sugar.  Mix   Beat in about a cup and a half of the
  remaining flour and work until dough is no longer sticky.   Put in
  a greased bowl.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until double
  in size.  divide into 12 to 16 pieces.   With your palms, roll out
  the pieces of dough into 16 to 18 inch pencil lengths.  Taper
  ends.   Form into pretzel shapes and put on greased cookie sheet
  until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 475 degrees.   In the
  meantime, mix the water and baking soda and bring to a boil.
  
  When the pretzels have doubled in size, use a slotted spatula and
  gently lower them into the water about one minute, or until they
  float to the top. (This is the tricky part.  The dough might be
  sticky, so be patient.)   Once the pretzels rise to the top,
  return them to the greased cookie sheet.   Sprinkle with course
  salt (you can usually buy this at supermarkets or at health food
  stores.)   Bake until crispy and browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
  
  The sooner you eat them after baking, the better they are.

      Title: Soft Pretzels #3
 Categories: Snacks, Breads/yeas
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 tb Dry yeast (1 package)
  1 1/4 c  Warm water
      3 c  Flour or more
      2 ts Salt
      4 ts Baking soda
           -Kosher salt
 
  Here's a recipe for Philadelphia Soft Pretzels...
  
  Dissolve yeast thoroughly in 1/4 c warm water. Mix 3 c flour
  and salt in large bowl. Add dissolved yeast with remaining 1
  c water. Add enough additional flour to make stiff dough.
  Knead 10 minutes or until dough feels elastic. Form dough
  into ball. Place in bowl and spread with butter. Cover with
  clean towel and let rise in warm place until doubled, about
  45 min.
  
  Divide dough into 12 small balls and roll each between hands
  to form rope 20 inches long. Form each into pretzel shape,
  wetting ends and pinching together firmly.
  
  Dissolve soda in 4 cups water and bring to boil. Drop
  pretzels, few at a time, into water and boil 1 minute or until
  pretzel floats to top. Remove and drain.
  
  Place drained pretzels on buttered baking sheet. Sprinkle
  with Kosher salt and bake at 475 degrees for 15 to 20
  minutes or until golden brown. Place on rack to cool.

BS>My requirements, however, may challenge the term, bread.  I'd
BS>like a couple of bread recipes that do _NOT_ use sugar,
BS>molasses, brown sugar, honey, or anything that remotely looks
BS>like simple sugar.  Salt is on the _NOT_ list too.  Whole
BS>grain flour is highly desireable, though I'm willing to go
BS>50/50.

I don't know if this will work, but it sounds similar to
a recipe I use for pizza dough.  The most whole wheat
flour I've used is 2 cups of 5 total cups.  Who knows,
maybe it would work with all whole wheat?  And I don't
see why it wouldn't make a *fair* bread if shaped into
a couple of loaves.

Pizza Dough

2 cups whole wheat flour
3 cups unbleached flour
2 pkgs quick-rise yeast
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp basil
1/4 tsp oregano
2 cups warm water

In a large bowl, stir together flours & spices.  Mound
the mixture in the middle of the bowl and make a indentation
in the top-middle (like a volcano).  Pour the yeast into
the indentation.  Pour the warm water into the hole with the
yeast, while stirring like crazy with a fork to incorporate
the water with the yeast/flour.  After all the water's added
continue to stir and scrape sides/bottom of bowl to get all
the little bits up.  When all the water's been stirred in
you'll have a pretty raggedy dough.  Flour your hands and
begin to knead the dough in the bowl to work in all the pieces.
You'll have to sprinkle a tablespoon or so of flour in every
now & then to keep it from stickin to your hands.  Once you've
got most of the pieces to hold together, transfer the dough
to a lightly floured board and continue to knead until the
dough's no longer sticky & you can leave a slight impression
in the dough with your finger.  Place the dough in an oiled
bowl and roll it over to cover with oil.  Put it in a warm
place to rise for one hour.  Punch down & shape the dough.

**At this point, I make the pizzas and bake them at 400
degrees for 20 minutes ... I think if I were to convert
this to bread, I'd make 2 loaves, put 'em in well-greased
loaf pans & let them rise again (no longer than 1 hour).
I'd also probably drop the temperature of the oven down
to 350 degrees and check the loaves after about 40 minutes
of baking (by tappin on the tops - if it sounds "hollow"
and they're brown, then they're done).

Good Luck!
