     Are you a Shareware author? Are you looking for a bulletin board
that will carry your programs for you? Well, if you are, then this board
is for you. We run WildCat! 4.0M10 and 4 nodes that are open and free to
the general public. We are located in Dayton, Oh and recieve between 150
and 200 calls per day from all over the country. We will set up a file
directory just for your programs on our bulletin board. The only catch i
you must either send the files to us on disk or call and upload them to
our BBS. We have 8.6 gigs of space available on our system. If you would
like your programs to be placed on our BBS, there are two ways of going
about this.
     First, if you wish to send the programs to us via the mail, send
the files to us on disk with a FILE_ID.DIZ file for each program, or
some other type of description file we can use. Please also include the
name of the file directory you wish to have the files put into. Here is
the address:
                       J&J's BBS
                       P.O. Box 24716
                       Huber Heights, Oh 45424
     Second, if you want to log onto J&J's BBS to upload them to us, fee
free to call us at 513-236-0917 and upload the files to the board. You
will not have access to upload on the first call, but will have access
within 24-36 hours. Please be sure to include descriptions and the name
of the file directory if you have a specific name in mind.
     We are a bulletin board that has been running for 6+ years now, sin
Sept. of 1988. We have Zyxel 19200 modems online and support baud rates
from 2400-19200.
