be tender (total cooking time for the tajin is between 1 1/2 and 2
hours.)  Remove couscous from steamer and toss with 1/4 pound butter,
mixing lightly until butter is melted. Place couscous on a large dish,
forming it into a mound. Make a good-sized well in the center. Place
the chicken and lamb pieces in the well and surround with the sauteed
onions. Sprinkle the raisins over all the arrange cooking liquid, which
has previously been reduced somewhat over a high fire, in a separate
dish.

Pass with the couscous a sauce made of the chili peppers, cumin,
coriander, parsley, and saffron mixed with 1/2 cup of the cooking
liquid, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. This
sauce is called Harisa. It is available canned in some specialty food
stores.
=========================> Notes and Credits <========================

Without the hot pepper sauce, the Algerian couscous would be very
pallid.

    6.  REMOVE from oven; cool upside down (I hang my angel food cake     
    upside down over the neck of a wine bottle to cool).

    Note sure where the recipe came from but this is the first angel food 
    cake I ever made and it came out great!  (Use the egg yolks to make a 
    yellow cake at the same time so there is no waste.)

PS>Title: Fresh Linguine with Asparagus Pesto

Hi Pat!  Thanks for this post which includes some of my favorites:

PS>Keywords: pasta, asparagus, pesto

PS>Trim any woody ends from the asparagus.  Cook for 5 to 6 minutes in

I used to snap off the ends of asparagus, cooking only the tender parts
that remained.  That is, before I learned how much more could be saved
by simply using a vegetable peeler on the stalks.  Guess the times
have taught me to be more frugal.

Last weekend there was an Asparagus Festival in Stockton, CA.  We were
going to go but the rains changed our minds.  I wonder if they had ice
cream made from asparagus, like the garlic ice cream at the Garlic
Festival in Gilroy?

Servings: 24

1       pk Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix
1/2     c  finely chopped red bell 
           -pepper
2       T  oil
8 1/2   oz can Green Giant Cream 
           -Style Sweet Corn
3       T  water
1          egg
4       oz Monterey Jack Cheese with 
           -Jalapeno Peppers, cut 
           -into 24 equal pieces
1       T  butter, melted

Grease 13 x 9" pan.  In large bowl, combine flour mixture with
yeast from foil packet; mix well.  In small saucepan over
medium-low heat, cook bell pepper in oil until tender.  Stir in
corn and water; heat to 120 to 130 degrees.  Stir hot corn
mixture and egg into flour mixture until dough pulls away from
sides of bowl.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.
With greased or floured hands, shape dough into a ball.  Knead
dough 5 minutes until smooth, sprinkling with additional flour
if necessary to reduce stickiness.  Cover dough with large bowl;
let rest 5 minutes.  Divide dough into 24 pieces.  Shape each
piece of dough around 1 piece of cheese, pulling dough under and

  Subj: balsamic vinegar
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Hi Nancy!

NB>Wasn't it you who posted the suggestion of using balsamic vinegar with
  >strawberries? I bought some today, and it was good. What else would it
  >be good with?

Michelle and Eric have been using it more than I have, I just tried it
with strawberries once.  Eric Decker sent me a post with lost of good
information in it.  I'll copy it here.    -Pat


   Balsamic is a bit different from any other vinegar in that the
acidity is less detectable. I find one can add a fair amount before a
plateau is reached and any more turns it into an acid bath.

   The key to using balsamic vinegar is to keep it below that point so
that the complex flavour is not ruined by acid overload.

   Brand? I go with only and any of the imported stuff from `southern
Italy' which are aged 50 yrs or more. Expensive? Yes, but only a little
is needed for a truly wonderful taste.

  Salad dressing?

   Use a broad variety of veggies but include Romaine, fresh pepper. Toss
thoroughly. Now add the B. vinegar slowly, toss, add, use only enough
balsamic vinegar to leave each leaf a bit glistening. Taste and add salt
to suit - finer taste control is had by doing the salt last. I do not
add garlic to a salad for Balsamic - the finer nuances of Balsamic are
drowned.

 Note: I use NO oil.

    The salad this produces is truly sensational, the Romaine takes on a
nutty flavour. Tomatoes adopt a tone of pure delight ...

ps. Butter sauteed whole clove of garlic served with a light sprinkle of
Balsamic is a taste delight of it's own! Blue cheese and red wine are
fine companions for this repast.

        1 1/3   cups    all-purpose flour*
        1/2     tsp.    salt
        1/4     cup     plus 3 Tbsp. lard (or 1/2 cup shortening)
        3 to 4  Tbsp.   cold water

FOR 8 OR 9-INCH TWO-CRUST PIE:

        2       cups    all-purpose flour*
        1       tsp.    salt

        4 to 5  Tbsp.   cold water

FOR 10-INCH TWO-CRUST PIE:

        2 2/3   cups    all-purpose flour*
        1       tsp.    salt
        3/4     cup     plus 2 Tbsp. lard (or 1 cup shortening)
        7 to 8  Tbsp.   cold water

INSTRUCTIONS:

Measure flour and salt into bowl.  Cut in lard/shortening thoroughly.
Sprinkle in water, 1 Tbsp. at a time, mixing until all flour is
moistened and dough almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 tsp. water can be
added if needed).

Gather dough into ball; shape into flattened round on lightly floured
cloth-covered board. (For Two-crust pies, divide dough in half and shape
into 2 flattened rounds.)  With floured stockinet-covered rolling pin,
roll dough 2" larger than inverted pie pan.  Fold pastry into quarters;
unfold and ease into pan.

For One-crust Pies: Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1" from rim of pan.
Fold and roll pastry under, even with pan; flute.  Fill and bake as
directed in recipe.

For Baked Pies Shell: Prick bottom and side thoroughly with fork.  Bake

For Two-crust Pies:  Turn desired filling into pastry-lined pie pan.
Trim overhanging edge of pasty 1/2" from rim of pan.  Roll second round

over filling and unfold.  Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1" from rim of
pan.  Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal;
flute.  Cover edge with 2 to 3" strip of foil to prevent excessive
browning; remove foil last 15 minutes of baking.  Bake as directed in
recipe.

* = If using self-rising flour, omit salt.  Pie crusts made with
    self-rising flour differ in flavor and texture from those made with
    plain flour.

      Title: Tuscan Bread
 Categories: Bakery, Breads
      Yield: 1 loaf
 
      1 oz Fresh yeast; -=OR=-
      2 pk -Instant dry yeast granules
  1 1/4 c  Warm water (125F)
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached white flour
    1/4 c  Whole wheat flour
 
  In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Mix the 2 flours
  and stir them in to make a soft dough. Knead 10 minutes by hand, or 4
  minutes in a heavy duty mixer with a dough hook. Oil a clean bowl and
  set the dough in it, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise
  until doubled in bulk. (In the traditional warm place, this will take
  about 2 hours. However, a cooler temperature will do as long as the
  dough has enough time to rise, including overnight in the
  refrigerator.) If the dough is ready sooner than it is needed, punch
  it down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at room
  temperature until ready to use. Rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a
  lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet. When the
  dough has completed its rising, punch it down, turn it out onto a
  floured work surface, and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches
  wide, 10 inches long, and 1/4-inch thick. It will still be very soft,
  but try to use a minimum of additional flour in handling it. Roll the
  dough tight, jelly-roll fashion, into a cylindrical shape. Flatten
  this to about 1-inch thick and roll it again. (This activates the web
  of gluten that will keep the loaf from flattening out in the oven.)
  
  For a round loaf: tuck both ends of the cylinder under to meet in the
  center, pinching to seal them. Roll the dough around the work surface
  under your hands, to shape it into a smooth ball about 5 inches in
  diameter.
  
  For an oblong loaf: roll the dough under your hands into a fat cigar
  shape, extending it to about 10 inches in length.  Set the loaf on
  the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely around it.
  
  Put the covered loaf, on its baking sheet, in a warm place to rise
  for 1 hour. Preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400F. Have a
  water- filled sprayer handy. Slide your hand under the towel, pick up
  the loaf, and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles. Spray water
  into the oven before closing the door, and spray twice more at
  2-minute intervals. Bake for 50 minutes or until golden brown. The
  bread should have a hollow sound when you knock on its bottom.

 Categories: Breads, Yeast
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      6 c  Flour
      1 ts Olive oil

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
      2 ts Dried oregano
      2 ts Dried basil
    1/2 ts Dried savory
    1/2 ts Dried rosemary
      2 ts Dried lemon peel
 
  In a large bowl combine the reast and the warm water. Let rest for 2
  minutes.
  
  Add 5 cups of the flour to the yeast mixture. Stir until well
  combined. Add the remaining flour, a little at a time, stirring until
  a dough forms. Do not add all the flour if it is not needed.
  
  Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes or
  until dough is no longer sticky and is smooth. Shape the dough into a
  ball. Place 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil in your hand. Roll the
  dough around in your hand until it is coated with oil. Place dough in
  a large bowl and cover with a towel. Let rise in a warm draft-free
  place for 35 minutes until doubled in size.
  
  In a small bowl combine the dried oregano, basil, savory, rosemary,
  and lemon peel.
  
  Punch the dough down and divide it in half. Flatten each half until it
  resembles a plate sized round. Brush the tops of the loaves with the
  remaining oil. Sprinkle the tops of the loves with the seasoning
  mixture.
  
  Place the loaves on baking sheets. Cover loaves with bowls and let
  rise in a warm draft free place for 30 minutes until doubled in size.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F.  Bake for 30 minutes or until tops are golden
  brown. Remove from oven. Cool or serve warm.

     16    Dried red chili pods
      2    Cloves garlic
      1    Hot Water
      1    Salt to taste

  Open each dried red chili pod. Wash well inside and out and remove
  blemishes. Remove stems, seeds and veins from the pods. For hotter
  chili leave some veins. Rinse with cold water and soak in hot water
  for one hour or until soft. Place the pods in an electric blender (or
  food processor) and add enough water to almost cover them, leaving
  about two inches headspace. Blend until smooth and skins disappear,
  about 2-3 minutes. If sauce seems to be too thick, add more water and
  blend for another 1 minute or until skins disappear. Add 2 cloves
  garlic and process until well blended. Salt to taste.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Here is one of the simplest recipes you'll find for a rich butterscotch
flavored pudding:

        Take the label off a can of Borden's Eagle Brand sweetened
        condensed milk, don't open the can! Place the can submerged into
        a pot of boiling water and let it simmer for 4-5 hours. Be
        careful to keep the can covered with boiling water the whole
        time. Twice in my life I forgot to keep the water replenished
        and we painted the kitchen both times...it will explode if the
        pot goes dry! After cooking, cool the can before opening. Best
        results are cold from the refrigerator. Two tablespoons are
        enough for a serving, it is rich!

would do.

MMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.01

      Title: Florentines
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies
      Yield: 15 servings

      1 c  Almonds, sliced
    1/4 c  Whipping cream
    1/3 c  Sugar, granulated
      4 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Candied orange peel, fine ch
      2 tb Flour, all-purpose
      4 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
      4 tb Vegetable shortening

  In a blender or food processor, whirl 1/2 cup of the almonds until
  finely ground.  Set aside.  Combine cream, sugar and butter in a
  medium-size pan and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until
  butter is melted. Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a
  boil; then remove from heat and stir in ground almonds, remaining 1/2
  cup sliced almonds, orange peel and flour; mix well.  Batter will be
  very thin. Drop batter by level tablespoonfuls onto lightly greased
  and flour-dusted baking sheets, spacing cookies 3-inches apart; then
  spread each into a 2-inch circle with the back of a spoon.  Preheat
  oven to 350. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until edges are lightly
  browned (centers will still be bubbling). Let cool on baking sheets
  for 1 to 2 minutes, then carefully transfer to racks with a wide
  spatula and let cool completely.  Turn cooled cookies upside down on
  a piece of wax paper.  Place chocolate and shortening in top of a
  double boiler over simmering water (or use microwave); stir until
  melted. With a soft pastry brush, paint a thin layer of chocolate
  over bottom of each cookie. Refrigerate until chocolate has hardened;
  the cover lightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

      Title: Gingersnap Gravy
 Categories: Cajun, Sauces
      Yield: 6 servings

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      1 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/4 ts Rubbed sage
    1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
    1/8 ts Ground cumin

MMMMM----------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      2 tb Chicken, pork, or beef fat
      2 tb Unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
    1/2 c  Finely chopped celery
    1/2 ts Minced garlic
      6 c  Basic chicken stock
      1 c  Pan drippings from chicken
      8    Gingersnap cookies
      1 ts Light brown sugar, to taste
      1 ts Ground ginger, to taste

  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
  Melt the fat and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When
  almost melted, add the onions, celery, and garlic; saute 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. Stir in the seasoning mix and cook 5 minutes
  more, stirring occasionally. Add the stock and pan drippings; bring
  to a boil over high heat and boil rapidly until liquid reduces to
  about 1 quart, about 25 minutes. Then crumble the gingersnaps into
  the stock mixture and whisk with a metal whisk until they are
  dissolved. Continue cooking 10 minutes, whisking frequently and
  making sure the gingersnaps are thoroughly dissolved. During this
  time, taste the gravy; if the ginger flavour is not pronounced, add
  the 1 tablespoon brown sugar and the 1 teaspoon ginger or add both to
  taste. Strain the gravy. Makes 2-1/2 to 3 cups. From Paul Prudhomme's
  "Louisiana Kitchen"

      Title: Vegetarian Gravy
 Categories: Sauces, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 servings

      2 c  Kidney bean; cooking juice
           -or from pinto or adzuki
           -beans
      2 tb Tamari soy sauce; up to 3 tb
           -or dark miso
      1 tb Oil, natural
    1/3 c  Whole wheat flour; or millet
           -flour or quinoa flour
    1/4 ts Chili powder; up to 1/2 tsp
           -or curry powder
    1/4 ts Sea salt

           Cayenne pepper;several dashs

  Use previously frozen bean "juice" or cook 1/2-1 lb beans until very
  tender and drain off and save 2 cups of the liquid. Use the
  'muddiest' part of the liquid for this recipe. Use the beans in
  another recipe or freeze them for later use. Combine all the
  ingredients with cooled bean juice and stir over medium-low heat
  until thickened. Use a wire whisk or blender to mix well. Correct the
  seasonings to taste and serve this gravy over potatoes, rice, whole
  grains, vegetables, mock meat loaf, burgers or other dishes.

      Title: Fat-Free Gravy
 Categories: Sauces, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 servings

      1 c  Broth & defatted drippings
      2 ts All purpose flour
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Ketchup
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Basil (beef) or sage (chick)

  A waist-watcher gravy - quite thin.  Serve over meat or potatoes.

  Cook up bones as for soup, strain liquid.  Refrigerate overnight or
  until white fat on top can be removed with a spoon.  Refrigerate meat
  drippings from the pan and skim off the fat.

  Combine broth, flour and cornstarch in a screw-top jar, cover and
  shake until well combined or use a blender for a larger batch.  Pour
  into saucepan, stir in ketchup, salt, pepper and basil for beef (or
  sage for turkey, or other herb of your choice).  Stir-cook over
  medium heat until gravy thickens.  (Mine didn't thicken but I had
  some lumps of flour or cornstarch.)  Makes about 1 cup.
