If he is using these batchfiles on a BBS, he would be advised NOT to use the 
"speed" parameter. It really serves no good purpose. He should also be sure 
to USE the "restrict" parameter on his receive batch file. VERY important for 
BBS's to use to prevent morons trying to upload "certain" files we won't talk 
about here.
