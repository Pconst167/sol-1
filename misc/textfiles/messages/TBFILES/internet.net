     **** Internet Feed Services * Via TBIE Gateway Services ****

AVAILABLE SERVICES:

* Internet email to/from the internet: Your address would default to
  first.last%xxx-yyy@hms.com. The xxx-yyy represents your fidonet address.
  IE. the xxx is your net number and the yyy is your node number. If so
  desired, a 'name' can be setup to alias for the 'cryptic' xxx-yyy part.
  For example, if you chose 'mybbs' then your address would also be
  first.last%mybbs@hms.com.

* UseNet Newsgroups: Gated usenet newsgroups to fido style FTSC echomail
  packets. There are currently over 10,000 newsgroups available on the
  internet and are ALL available here as gated FTSC echomail packets. This
  allows you to import the newsgroups to your BBS just the same as you
  would/are importing fidonet echomail areas.

* Internet Mailing Lists: These can be picked up one of two ways. Either
  in the standard format as email messages, or I can also gate them to an
  FTSC format echomail area.

* ALL the above are 2 way connections! You can read AND reply to all
  messages!

* To get more information, file request INTERNET from 1:104/825.0.

* To get a list of all the available newsgroups, freq NEWSGROUPS from
  1:104/825.0.
