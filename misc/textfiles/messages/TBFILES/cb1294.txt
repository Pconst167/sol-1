 EH> Also-----for a newcomer....what is the scoop on recipe software?

 You will see a variety of formats posted.  The top two favorites seem
 to be MealMaster and Qbook.  Both are shareware and should be
 available for download from a variety of boards.  If you cannot find
 them locally, give a shout and we will help you find them.

 Meal Master is the format we used above.  The MealMaster program has
 many features, allowing search of the data base under multiple
 criteria, resizing of recipes, helps making grocery lists and much
 more.  The Qbook program allows for more free form in its recipe
 input and uses compression to pack more recipes onto your disk.  Both
 programs have their devotees (not quite as bad as the Chili wars
 though <G> ).  We use and have registered both programs.

 Many recipes are posted in other formats or in free form format.
 What I and others do is to use a conversion program as an aid to
 converting those recipes into MM format.  I prefer MMCONV, but
 others have strong followings as well.  You could register both
 MMCONV and MMMENU (which helps with conversion and more) for less
 than the price of a large Cicero's Pizza Pizza.  If you can get it,
 all are discussed on the new Meal-Master echo.

 SS> Why not both?  Post what you have now, and then with refinements added
 SS> later?

Okay, here goes--I haven't even bothered to input them into mm yet
'cause I'm still diddling with them.

"Cheesecake" #1:

2 32-oz cartons yogurt, 1 low-fat vanilla, 1 non-fat plain
1/2 c honey (adjust to taste if you prefer a sweeter c'cake)
1 ts vanilla extract
3 tb corn starch
3 lg eggs (or you can substitute an equivalent quantity of egg
whites--the second batch I baked I used only _2_ eggs without any
noticeable difference)

Drain whey from yogurt in fridge for a minimum of 24 hrs (I drained
mine for about 30 hours). I've found it's best to use Dannon yogurt 
'cause it doesn't have gelatin in it and it drains and thickens 
easily.

Crust: For both batches I used low-fat bran muffin crumbs moistened
with just enough apple juice to hold it together (water would
probably work just as well). First time I used a 9" springform pan
(about 1-1/2 cups of crumbs), second time I opted for a 7"x3"
s'form pan and a higher c'cake--I reduced the amount of muffin
crumbs for crust accordingly ('bout 1 cup).

Preheat oven to 300F (my springforms are dark, non-stick, so I 
stayed on the scant side of 300 with my oven thermometer, BTW).

Used my KA mixer to thoroughly blend all the ingredients for the 
filling. Baked it [9" pan] for 65 minutes, turned oven off and let 
it sit for another 15 minutes, set it on a rack to cool, then 
removed the collar and popped it in the fridge for 4 hrs 'fore I 
let Rich at it.

Results: It produced a dense c'cake, but Rich said it wasn't as
rich as the usual (is any substitute gonna ever be as rich as cream
cheese? <g>) and he liked that cause he could eat more--figures ;)--
It had a noticeable "tang" to it so I'll probably increase the
honey a bit on the next go-round. Doesn't seem to be a need to use
more than 2 eggs either. FYI, Rich ate both the c'cakes plain
without any fruit topping--next batch I'll probably thicken some
crushed pineapple (in its own juice) or something similar and top
with that which may make the tang less noticeable (I'd really
rather use non-fat plain yogurt altogether, if possible).


"Cheesecake" #2:

Same as above 'cept I used a 7"x3" springform pan, 2 32-oz cartons
of low-fat _vanilla_ yogurt, substituted a scant 1/2 cup of maple
syrup for the honey, eliminated the vanilla extract and cut the
eggs to only 2. Adjusted cooking time--this one baked at the _very_ 
slight side of 300 for 65 minutes, then down to between 275-300 
(closer to 275) for another 30 minutes, then turned oven off and 
let it sit another 20 minutes.

Results: A _very_ dense c'cake and no "tang", but added sugar and 
fat using the l-f vanilla yogurt. Neither of us could taste any
maple flavor and, again as above, I'll probably add a bit more 
maple to my next batches. Rich liked both batches, but preferred 
this one and I couldn't figure out from asking him whether it was 
simply because it was thicker in the smaller pan or 'cause he 
preferred the taste.

Oh, FYI, the next batch I'm likely to take a run at an all non-fat
yogurt c'cake and I'll increase the honey and/or maple syrup to at
least 1 cup (which means I'll prolly have to up the corn starch a
tad too).

I warned you it was "flexible" <g>...

      Title: Whole Wheat Sesame Crackers
 Categories: Breads, Appetizers, Snacks, Vegan
      Yield: 72 crackers

      6 tb Sesame seeds; plus...
    1/2 c  Sesame seeds
      1 c  Water
      3 tb Canola or safflower oil
      1 ts Fine sea salt
  2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/2 ts Nonaluminum baking powder

  Surprise your family or guests with freshly baked crackers.  For
  special occasions, use cookie cutters to make them into imaginative
  shapes.  Serve them with a dip for an appetizer or pack them in a
  lunch.  Crackers will keep for two to three weeks stored in an
  airtight container.  If the crackers lose some of their crispness,
  heat them at 250 F for about 5 minutes.
 
  DIRECTIONS:
  ===========
  Position two racks in the center and the bottom third of the oven, and
  preheat the oven to 350 F.
 
  Spread 2 tablespoons sesame seeds on each of three unoiled baking
  sheets. This will prevent the crackers from sticking and will give
  them a delicious crisp bottom.
 
  Put the water, oil, and salt in a small bowl until combined. Stir in
  the 1/2 cup sesame seeds.  Add the water-oil mixture and mix to form
  a rough dough.  Knead the dough in the bowl to form a ball, and turn
  out onto a lightly floured work surface.
 
  Lightly flour a rolling pin.  Roll the dough out into a 22- by 14-inch
  rectangle, about 1/16-inch thick.  Using a fork, prick the dough all
  over to release trapped air and keep the dough flat.  With a pizza
  wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares or other
  shapes, or cut shapes with a 2-inch cookie cutter.
 
  Using a spatula, transfer the crackers to the prepared baking sheets.
  Bake until the crackers are light brown and firm to the touch, 15 to
  20 minutes, switching the positions of the sheets halfway through the
  baking time.  When the first two sheets are finished, remove them,
  and bake the third one as directed.  Cool completely.

Hello Anthony:
AW>Hello, I'm rather new to this conference, but was wondering if
AW>anyone has a recipes for home-made crackers? Any kind will do.

Welcome to the cooking Echo. Here's some cracker recipes as requested:
-Begin Recipe Export- QuikBook version 0.96 Beta A

Title: Saltines and Family
Keywords: crackers, breads

Makes about 11 dozen 2" saltines

Use this dough to make a whole range of crackers - saltines; oyster
crackers; and big, round sea toast crackers.

3 Tbs shortening                        2 Tbs butter
about 3 1/2 cup unbleached flour        1 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt                            1/4 tsp sugar
1 egg white, beaten to a loose froth    1 cup whole milk
kosher, sea, or table salt

Melt the shortening and butter together; let cool.  Sift 1 3/4 cup of the
flour into a lg mixing bowl along with the baking powder, salt, and
sugar; make a well in the center and pour in the shortening and butter;
stir to combine, then stir in the egg white.  Add the milk and beat
vigorously to smooth out some of the lumps, then gradually sift in
enough flour to make a dough that will be stiff enough to roll out.
Form the dough into a ball; knead it for 10 min on a floured surface
until it is smooth and satiny.  Divide the dough into 2 equal balls,
wrap each in wax paper and let them rest at room temperature for 20 - 30
min.

On a floured surface, roll the first dough ball out as thinly as you
possibly can.  Cut the dough into 2" squares using a pizza cutter, a
ravioli wheel, or a very sharp, greased knife; save the scraps.  Place
the dough squares just slightly apart from each other on ungreased
cookie sheet.  Sprinkle the squares with salt to taste and pat them to
embed the salt.  Prick each square several times with a fork.  Bake in a
preheated 375F oven for 15 to 20 min until just slightly browned.
Repeat for remaining dough ball and scraps.

SEA TOAST

After the dough has rested, pinch off pieces about 1 1/2 to 2" round.
On a floured surface, roll each piece into the thinnest free-form circle
possible.  Place the circles on an ungreased cookie sheet; prick with a
fork and bake at 375F for about 15 min.  Very crispy and perfect for
cheese or soups.  Makes about 2 dozen.

OYSTER CRACKERS

One rested dough ball at a time, roll the dough out as thinly as
possible; transfer to a cookie sheet.  Cut the dough into diamond
shaped, 1" crackers with a ravioli wheel or a pizza cutter; there is no
need to separate the crackers as the dough's elasticity will do the job.
Salt, embedded and gently prick the diamonds as previously described.
Bake as directed for about 10 min.

Title: Honey Graham Crackers
Keywords: cracker, snack

Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose unbleached flour           1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup dark brown sugar, tightly packed      3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt                                  1/2 stick butter, in 4 pieces
1/3 cup honey                                 1 tsp vanilla extract
5 Tbl water
Directions:
Use the metal blade of your food processor to combine the
flours, brown sugar, soda, salt and butter, about 10 pulses. Add
the remaining ingredients, pulse 5 times, then process until
the mixture forms a mass, about 20 seconds. Remove the
dough, press it into a ball and divide it in half. Cover one half
with plastic wrap.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Roll out the other half on a buttered rimless 14x17 inch baking
sheet. Lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll until it is
very thin and covers the baking sheet. Use the sharp side of a
knife to cut the dough into 3 inch squares, then use the dull
side of the knife to divide the squares in half. Prick evenly
with a fork. Bake until evenly browned and firm to the touch,
about 12-15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough on a
second baking sheet.
Follow the scored lines to cut the crackers apart while warm;
they will crisp as they cool. Gently lift them from the baking
sheet with a spatula. Separate the crackers and store in air-
tight containers.
Makes about 50 crackers.

 Hi Anthony, welcome to the National Cooking Echo.  Here are three
 recipes I have not had the time to try yet,  but they thought may be
 of interest to you.

Two this message; one next message:

MMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.01
 
      Title: FONDUE CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 80 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
      4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/2 lb (8 ounces) Swiss cheese,
           Shredded (2 to 2-1/2 cups,
           Loosely packed)
    1/4 c  Water
 
  "If you want the flavor of cheese fondue, but don't want the fuss and
  commotion, try these crackers. You may never bother with the real
  thing again. These cheese crackers are very rich, but very light.
  They are excellent with a light Alsatian Gewurztraminer or Grey
  Riesling. 325~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, mix the flour, salt,
  pepper, and nutmeg. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Add the cheese and blend until it is evenly coated. Blend
  in the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
  ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface of pastry cloth, roll out to about 3/8 inch thick. Cut into
  bite-sized squares (about 1 inch by 1 inch). Arrange on an ungreased
  sheet, making sure the edges of the crackers are not touching.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes. Turn the crackers over and continue baking
  another 10 to 15 minutes, until medium brown. These crackers should
  be crisp. Cool them on racks. Yield: 70-80.
  
  VARIATIONS: For a more traditional fondue taste, add 1 teaspoon
  Kirsch or cherry liqueur when adding the water. And use two different
  types of Swiss cheese, such as Gruyere and Emmenthaler.

Title: Oatmeal Crackers
Keywords: Oatmeal, Breakfast, Crackers, Bread, Kids

Ingredients:
1 cup lard                    1 cup sugar
1 egg                         1 tsp vanilla flavoring
1/2 tsp lemon flavoring       3 cups quick rolled oats
2 tsp milk                    1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp salt                    1 tsp soda

Directions:
Cream shortening and sugar together well, and then add the egg and
flavoring. Stir in the oats and milk. Sift together the flour, salt
and soda and add the creamed mixture. (You probably will have to use
your hands to work in dry ingredients thoroughly. Shape into rolls,
wrap in waxed paper and store in the refrigerator. When ready to bake,
slice thinly and bake on greased cooky sheet at 375 degrees until
lightly browned.

I also made your cashew loaf.  I loved it, Peter was indifferent, the
kids weren't wild about it.  Next time, though, I'll use a LOT more
mushrooms!  I have some questions in my "comments" though:

MMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.01

      Title: Layered Cashew & Mushroom Loaf
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Tested
      Yield: 8 servings

      1 tb Oil
      1 sm Onion; finely chopped
      8 oz Cashew nuts
      4 oz Breadcrumbs, pref. wholewht.
      1    Eggs
      3 md Parsnips; cooked & mashed
    1/2 ts Rosemary
    1/2 ts Thyme leaves
      1 ts Yeast extract
    1/2 c  Stock
           Salt
           Black pepper
      2 tb Butter
      8 oz Mushrooms; chopped
           Oil; to grease pan

  Use potatoes in place of parsnips when parsnips are not in season.  If
  using fresh herbs, double the amount.

  Heat oil and fry onion and garlic till soft.  Grind cashews in a nut
  mill, blender or mincer then mix with breadcrumbs.  Beat egg well and
  add to dry ingredients.  Mix in parsnips (or potatoes) and herbs.
  Add fried onion and garlic.  Be sure to scrape in all the juice as
  the loaf can get a little dry during baking.  Dissolve the yeast in
  stock and add to other ingredients.  Season well.

  Preheat oven to 350 F (180 C, gas mark 4).  Melt butter in skillet and
  saute the mushrooms till they are soft. Grease a 2 pound loaf pan then
  press in half the loaf mixture.  Cover with the mushrooms and top
  with the rest of the nut mixture.  Press down firmly.  Cover with
  aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour.

  When cooked, let stand for 10 minutes and then turn onto a plate.
  Slice and serve.  Excellent hot or cold.  It also freezes well.  To
  freeze, slice into portions, wrap in foil and toss in freezer.  To
  re-use, thaw, then heat in a medium oven till hot.

  Karen's notes: I think this one is my favorite vegetarian recipe.  No
  matter how many times I make it, I *never* get tired of it.  Any
  leftovers can be refrigerated to make a nice pate' the next day.

  Sylvia's notes: I used plain water instead of stock, instant mashed
  potatoes instead of cooked parsnips, and didn't bother with the yeast
  extract.  I also ground the rosemary, and used an 8"x8" pan for 8
  servings instead of a loaf pan (because I didn't have one).  It was
  very tasty, flavorful and satisfying.  But I have some questions: (1)
  how do you know when it's through baking?  Mine didn't brown or
  anything (2) how do you turn it into a pate?

Kathy, Have saved and enjoyed so many of your recipes thought I would send
this for you and Sylvia.

                               BANGERS

3 1/4 lbs pork, monced
1 lb fresh white bread crumbs
1 tsp fresh ground pepper
grated rind of 1/2 lemon
1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
6 fresh sage leaves chopped
1/2 tsp chopped winter savory
1/2 tsp dried marjoram

Mix the pork with the other ingredients in a large bowl. Add enough water to
make a mixture with a soft piping constistency. Fill sausage skins. Allow
sausages to mature overnight..

I have not tried the afore mentioned, but I have this one, and it is 'almost'
perfect. I have had them many times in England, and most British shops here in
S. Fl carry them, albiet frozen. Call around to pubs ect.

                                   BANGERS

1/2 lb lean pork
1/2 lb lean veal
6 ox pork fat
3 slices white bread
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/8 tsp nutmeg and mace
1/8 tsp thyme
1/8 tsp marjoram
1 tsp sage
1 tsp finely grated lemon peel
1 large egg

Combine all ingredients in bowl until well mixed. Fry up a small amount to
check for taste of spices. Adjust as needed. Fill sausage casings,be sure and
prick casings at least once. Leave overnight in refrigerator (if you can). I
ususally poach the sausages  and then brown.

Enjoy!
then brown. Paaching gets rid of some of the fat

Well I posted a letter to you a few days ago with one for my mom and I lost it
somewhere in the black hole of my computer, so here goes again.....
Anyway, I thought I'd share a recipe that looked trully decadent...
Title: Louisiana Pralines
Keywords: candy
   ingrediants:
1 c. sugar
1 c. brown sugar
1/2 t. baking soda
1 c. buttermilk
1/8 t. salt
2 T. margarine
1 1/4 c. pecans
1 t. vanilla
   Put sugar, baking soda, buttermilk and salt in a 4 quart saucepan. Stir
constantly, dissolve over low heat. Bring to a boil until candy "threads".
Remove from heat and add the butter, nuts and vanilla. Beat this mixture until
thick and a little sugary. Place saucepan back on low heat to keep the candy
pliable. Drop by teaspoon onto wax paper to form patties.

  I've had some peppers that lived under the normal temperature, but they
didn't seem to put much fruit out.  But if you've got direct sunlight on them,
I think something like Perma-Gro brand Super Bloom will help them a lot, if you
can get that over there?

  Nothing so far, in fact some really bad storms just split and went around
both sides of us this week.  Miraculous, in some ways.  I was certainly glad.

That means they are going to die!  There is NO chance of keeping

       1 ts Salt
       1    Lemon
       1    Plain Yoghurt 15 floz
     1/2    Medium Onion, peeled, chopped
       1    Clove Garlic, peeled
     3/4    Inch fresh Ginger, peeled
     1/2    Fresh Hot Green Chili, chopped
       2 ts Garam Masala
       3 tb Yellow liquid Food Coloring, mixed with
       1 tb Red liquid Food Coloring
            Wedges of Lime, Optional

  DIRECTIONS:

  Cut each leg into two pieces and each breast into four pieces.  Cut
  two long slits on each side of each part of the legs. The slits
  should never start at the edge and never reach the bone. Cut similar
  slits on the meaty side of each breast piece.

  Spread the chicken out on a large platter.  Sprinkle half the salt and
  squeeze the juice from three-quarters of a lemon over them.  Lightly
  rub the salt and lemon juice into the slits. Turn the chicken pieces
  over and do the same on the other side with remaining salt and lemon
  juice. Set aside for 20 minutes.

  Combine the yoghurt, onion, garlic, ginger, green chili and garam
  masala in the container of an electric food processor. Blend until
  you have a smooth paste.  Empty the paste into a strainer set over a
  large ceramic or stainless steel bowl. Push the paste through.

  Brush the chicken pieces on both sides with the food coloring, then
  put them with any accumulated jucies and any remaining food coloring
  into the bowl with the marinade. Mix well, making sure that the
  marinade goes into the slits in the chicken. Cover and refrigerate
  for 6-24 hours (the longer the better)

  Preheat the oven to it's maximum temperature.

  Take the chicken pieces out of the bowl, shaking off as much marinade
  as possible.  Arrange them in a large shallow baking tray in a single
  layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until just done. You might test the
  chicken with a fork just to be sure. Serve hot, with lime wedges.

  N.B.  The left over marinade may be frozen, and re-used once only.

  Heat the butter in a wide saute pan or a large frying pan. When
  butter has melted, add all the ingredients in the measuring jug.
  Bring to a simmer and cook on medium heat for a minute, mixing in the
  butter as you do so. Add the chicken pieces (but not their
  accumulated juices). Stir once and put the chicken pieces on a warm

This memo from Rob Gearhart just crossed my desk:

 RG> Hello All.
 RG> I'm a lurker who snags all of your great recipes and attemps to
 RG> try them all out.

Welcome aboard, Rob.  Nice to see you've given up your lurker status...

 RG> I did a scan looking for pies the other day, wanting to
 RG> find a bannana cream pie that you could eat with a fork instead of
 RG> a straw. ( mine <g> )  Not one pie did I come up with.  Maybe no
 RG> one eats pie anymore, but I doubt it.

Not really a recipe, but if you want an EASY, fool-proof pie, here it
is:

1. Purchase (or make) a graham cracker crust.

2.  Prepare a large package of vanilla pudding mix (instant is okay,
but the regular is better) according to the pie-filling directions on
the box.  You also could use bananna flavor, but it has a nasty,
artificial after-taste, IMHO.

3. Slice 2 banannas thinly, and place in the bottom of the crust.  Top
with the pudding.

4.  Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding (it
should touch it).  This prevents a nasty skin from forming.

5.  Immediately before serving, top the pie with a thick layer of
whipped cream, sweetened to taste, and flavored with a few drops of
vanilla.  (In a REAL emergency, you could substitute whipped topping
for the whipped cream, just don't blame me for the results ;-)

This is actually the softest, easiest, laziest way to make just about
any cream pie your heart desires.

 There are lots of pie eaters among this group.  I will start you off

      Title: Corn Muffins
 Categories: Breads, Vegetarian, Vegan

      2 c  Corn flour or cornmeal
           - (yellow or blue)
      1 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
      6 oz Soft tofu
      3 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt (sea salt in book)

  Mix flours. Crumble tofu into blender.  Add boiled water and salt to
  tofu in blender (carefully) and blend until not quite smooth. (Just a
  few pulses please). Dont do this in too small blender or without lid
  like I did once. The goal is muffins, not 2nd degree burns. Add
  immediately to flour and mix well.  Spoon into muffin tins or cast
  iron stick trays and bake at 400 degrees for about 1/2 hour until
  golden brown. She suggests you heat oven first and place oiled muffin
  tins in to heat up beforehand to get a "wonderful crust".
 
  Please note, I have to oil the tins because I don't use teflon
  products around by birds, but this might work also.....This is not
  sweet bread, I serve corn potato chowder with it.  The corn sticks
  are better!

      Title: INJERA (Flat bread)
 Categories: Ethiopian, African, Bread
      Yield: 8 servings

      4 c  Self-rising flour
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Club soda

      Combine flours and baking powder in a bowl. Add club soda plus
  about 4 cups water. Mix into a smooth, fairly thin batter. Heat a
  large, non-stick skillet. When a drop of water  bounces on the pan's
  surface, dip enough batter from the bowl to  cover the bottom of the
  skillet, and pour it in quickly, all at once. Swirl the pan so that
  the entire bottom is evenly coated,  then set it back on the heat.
      When the moisture has evaporated and small holes appear on the
  surface, remove the injera. It should be cooken only on one side, and
  not too browned. If your first one is a little pasty and undercooked,
  you may need to cook a little longer or to make  the next one
  thinner. But, as with French crepes, be careful not to cook them too
  long, or you'll have a crisp bread that may be  tasty but won't fold
  around bits of stew. Stack the injera one on top of the other as you
  cook, covering with a clean cloth to prevent their drying out.

      Title: Scallion Cakes
 Categories: Breads, Chinese, Vegan
      Yield: 10 servings

      1 lb All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Coarse-grain sea salt
           -OR- kosher salt
      5    Scallions; coarsely chopped
      5 tb Vegetable oil (or more)

  Place the flour in a mixing bowl.  Sprinkle evenly with the baking
  powder and sugar.  Mix with a wooden spoon.  Add the water gradually,
  stirring and mixing with the wooden spoon.  Knead the dough for 3-4
  minutes.  Cover it with a damp cloth and leave for half an hour, then
  knead again for 2-3 minutes.  Divide the dough into ten portions and
  form into narrow strips 8-10 inches long.  Flatten the strips with a
  rolling pin and ten bands of pancake thickness.  Sprinkle each band
  with salt and then with chopped scallions.  Roll the bands lengthwise
  into long double-thickness spaghetti-shaped strips.  Hold one end of
  the strip and turn the other end around in circles until the
  concentric rings form themselves around the center into a spiral
  pancake.  Flatten the pancake with the palm of the hand.  Repeat
  until the dough has been made into ten spiral pancakes.
 
  Heat the oil on the bottom of a large flat-bottomed frying pan.  When
  hot, lift the handle of the frying pan so that the surface of the pan
  is evenly greased.  Place the spiral pancakes on the surface of the
  pan.  Fry over low heat for 2-1/2 to 3 minutes and turn the pancakes
  over.  Repeat and fry gently until the pancakes are evenly browned on
  both sides.

      Title: Whole Wheat Flatbread (Chapati)
 Categories: Breads, Indian, Vegetarian, Vegan
      Yield: 14 servings

  2 1/4 c  Durum flour
    1/2 ts Sea salt
      1 tb Canola oil
    2/3 c  -Very warm water

  Combine flours and salt in a large mixing bowl.
 
  Mix in oil and water to form a stiff dough, adding more water if
  necessary.  Remove dough from bowl and knead on a lightly floured
  surface until smooth, about 5 minutes.
 
  Return dough to bowl, cover with a towel and set aside in a warm
  place for one hour.
 
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 14 equal
  portions.  Roll each piece into a ball and cover with a damp towel.
 
  Heat an ungreased griddle or large frying pan over medium heat.
  Working with one ball of dough at a time, flatten it, then roll into
  a 6" circle, using only enough flour to keep dough from sticking.
  When griddle is hot, pick up dough, shake off excess flour and place
  it on a hot pan.  Cook until brown spots appear, about one minute.
  Flip dough over and cook on other side.  (Chapati may puff up while
  cooking.)
 
  Cover and place in a warm oven while cooking remaining chapatis.

      Title: Baked Flatbread with Garlic (Lahsooni Naan)
 Categories: Breads, Indian, Vegetarian, Vegan
      Yield: 12 servings

      4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 ts Sea salt
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Egg replacer
      1 c  Soymilk or lowfat milk
      2 tb Canola oil
    1/4 c  Olive oil or melted ghee
      2    Garlic cloves; minced

  Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt.  Set aside.
 
  Whisk water and egg replacer.
 
  Mix egg replacer, soy milk and canola oil in a large bowl.
 
  Add flour mixture to soymilk mixture and stir until dough forms a
  ball. Knead briefly, place in a greased bowl and cover with a damp
  towel.  Let dough rest in a warm, draft-free area for 2-1/2 to 3
  hours.
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Lightly oil baking sheets.
 
  Saute garlic in olive oil for 2 minutes.  Set aside.
 
  Lightly coat hands with vegetable oil and knead dough on a lightly
  floured surface until smooth, about 3 minutes.  Divide dough into 12
  equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Flatten each ball with hands,
  roll into an oval about 3/8" thick and stretch ends to form a
  teardrop shape (wide at base and tapering to a point on top).
 
  Place on baking sheets and brush with garlic oil.  Bake on middle
  rack for 6 to 8 minutes.
