Let say you set up the first 5 disks of the Slackware release..A1, A2, A3, A4
and A5.  You probably would need say 10 meg for that... What could you do at
that point?  Well, you could look at directories with the ls command - the
linux equivalent to DIR in DOS.

If you installed the A series, *and* the AP series disks, you'd be be able to
actually learn the *nix operating system and that would take about 30meg.

There's a file on my BBS you probably ought to read.. it's a an info file
outlining just this kind of thing.  Magic name LNXINFO (LNX.INF)

Take care,
Janis
