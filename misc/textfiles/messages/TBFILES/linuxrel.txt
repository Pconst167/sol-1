 For Immediate Release

              VERSION 1.2 OF LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM RELEASED

HELSINKI, Finland -- March 8, 1995 -- Linus Torvalds today announced the
release of version 1.2 of the popular Linux operating system.

Linux V1.2 is the most cost-effective way to turn a PC into a
professional Unix workstation, to set up a private node on the Internet,
or to provide a stable low-cost server platform for institutional
networks.  Since the release of Linux V1.0 on March 14, 1994, Linux has
grown in size to an installed base of over 500,000 machines in personal,
educational, and commercial settings.  It is regularly used in scientific
workstations, to provide network services, as a business computing
platform, as a software development platform and environment, and for
personal computing.

All of the software needed to build a stable, full-featured Unix
environment around the Linux kernel is freely available, including all
standard Unix utilities, XFree86 X Window System, GCC ANSI C/C++
compiler, a full suite of networking software, advanced text-processing
tools, the emacs editor and more.  Over a thousand applications have been
written for or ported to Linux.  Additional software allows Linux to run
DOS and SCO Unix applications, as well as to share resources, such as
disks and printers with Microsoft's Windows for Workgroups, DOS platforms
and Macintoshes, making Linux ideal for all "mission critical"
applications in mixed-OS environments.

Linux is a full-featured Unix operating system for PCs (386 or higher)
which supports true multitasking, 32-bit virtual memory, shared libraries
and executables, demand paging, advanced memory management, dynamically
linked libraries and TCP/IP networking.  Linux V1.2 adds to this list:
performance enhancements, loadable kernel modules, increased portability,
support for many more peripherals, PCI support, PCMCIA support, EIDE
support, an increasing variety of network protocols, support for
ELF-format binaries, and more.

Linux V1.2 is free software developed by Linus Torvalds along with an
international development team; it is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License.  No licensing fees are required to use Linux,
and the source code is freely available to all developers and users,
which speeds up the pace of development and finds and corrects problems
quickly.  This unique development effort has produced a product which can
compete with the multi-million dollar efforts of commercial OS providers.

Many companies have adopted Linux as their development platform of choice
or make money selling and supporting Linux and Linux-related products.
Russell Nelson, President of Crynwr Software, had this to say: "We use
Linux for all our mission-critical applications.  Having the source code
means that we're not held hostage by anyone's support department."

Linux was honored with the prestigious "Outstanding Product Award" for
1994 by Unix Review magazine in the December issue. And Linux author
Linus Torvalds was honored with the "Excellence In Programming Award
1995" by Dr. Dobbs Journal in the March issue. Recognition of his
outstanding achievement is software development was measured by "the
principles of openness, cooperation, and technical superiority."

Linux V1.2 is currently being ported to the DEC Alpha (with full 64-bit
support), MIPS, Motorola 68000 family and Sparc platforms.

Linux V1.2 is available at no cost by anonymous FTP and on many BBSs, and
is sold by several CD-ROM vendors.  For more information on Linux,
