 Hello Russ,

RG> How does one go about making 2 col. for listing the files and msg
RG> areas? thanks for any help - been checking the docs bit i must be
RG> missing it or overlooking it.

Play with the following lines in the "Session Section" of Max.Ctl.

        Format FileFormat   %x16%x01%x0e%5.5# ...
        Format FileHeader   %x16%x01%x0fFile  ...
        Format MsgFormat    %x16%x01%x0e%3.3# ...
        Format MsgHeader    %x16%x01%x0fMessa ...

Make certain that you make a backup copy of your existing Max.Ctl first though,
because unless you've stuck a horseshoe some place where the sun don't shine,
your changes will not work the first time around.

If you've still got the original default Max.Ctl file from the full Maximus
installation package, it contains a few examples of these lines, along with
some comments.  A bit of playing with it, and it doesn't take too long to
figure it out.
