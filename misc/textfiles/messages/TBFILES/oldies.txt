 BT> BROWSE.LZH   Browse through an ASCII text file

 TB> Is the above freeware or public domain?  How big is it?

    I've seen two such things.  This one is probably an old PC Mag
 utility, and weighs in at 1K.

 BT> CPU.COM      Tells what speed computer is running at
 BT> CSAP208B.LZH Sorts and squeezes directories on hard disk

 TB> I will take the above.

    Look for the more recent version of CSAP: it's up to 3.12 or so.

 BT> DESKMATE.LZH Excellent pop-up desk utility

 TB> What sort of features does this provide?

    It's a bit like SideKick.

 BT> MAXI.LZH     Increases the formatted size of floppy disks
 BT> MAXI154A.LZH Format 360K floppy to 420K - 720K to 800K

 TB> I will take the above but what is the difference between MAXI.LZH and
 TB> MAXI154A.LZH?

    MAXI154A is a newer version.  Maxi is up to v1.7, BTW.

 TB> Where did you find all these treasures?

    They were common years back, and have mostly been superseded by
 other programs.
