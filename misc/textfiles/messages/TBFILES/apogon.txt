This file will detail all of the official Online Support Forums/areas that
Apogee & 3D Realms have.  There have been a lot of changes regarding online
support with us recently, and wanted to make sure that everyone has the
current and correct information!

1) Software Creations / Software Creations Web BBS
   -----------------------------------------------
   Regular Dial-Up Phone Lines:

   (508) 368-7036    2400 - 14.4k   (Public Access)
   (508) 368-6604    14.4k - 28.8k  (Public Access)
   (508) 368-7139    2400 - 14.4k   (Member Access)
   (508) 368-3424    14.4k - 28.8k  (Member Access)

   You can also access the BBS if you have Telnet access on the Internet
   by telnetting to 'bbs.swcbbs.com'.

   There is a list of the 3,500 or so nodes in the Apogee/3D Realms File
   Distribution Network.  Once you log onto Software Creations, take a look
   at Bulletin #16, which contains a list of all of them.

   You can acess the "Software Creations Web BBS" on the World Wide Web
   by pointing your Web Browser to 'http://www.swcbbs.com'.  This is not
   the same thing as the regular DOS based BBS.  Software Creations and
   the Software Creations Web BBS are two seperate things.

   Apogee & 3D Realms files are free downloads.  In other words, you do not
   have to subscribe to the BBS to download them.  However, if you're
   interested in other files, you should ask the SysOp of Software Creations
   (not Joe Siegler) for more information.

2) CompuServe
   ----------
   Apogee & 3D Realms have their own forum on CompuServe as of Aug 10, 1995.
   It is accessible by typing 'GO APOGEE' or 'GO REALMS' at any ! prompt.
   All of our shareware, patches, and slide shows are available here, plus
   there are libraries of user submitted files as well.

   Apogee E-Mail on CIS   : 74200,553
   3D Realms E-Mail on CIS: 102052,513

   In celebration of the opening of this new forum, a file was created that
   has NEW screen shots from Duke3D and Shadow Warrior; upcoming games from
   3D Realms.  The file is available with the filename of DNSWSHOT.ZIP.

3) America Online
   --------------
   Apogee & 3D Realms have their own forum on America Online. It is accessible
   by using the keywords 'APOGEE' or '3D REALMS'.  All of our shareware,
   patches, and slide shows are available here, plus there are libraries of
   user submitted files as well.

   Apogee E-Mail on AOL   : APOGEE
   3D Realms E-Mail on AOL: REALMS999

4) The Internet
   ------------
   Apogee can be reached at a variety of ways on the Internet.  Please be
   careful, as some software servers are case sensitive to these things. :)

   E-Mail
   ======
   Apogee   : apogee.software@apogee1.com or apogee@metronet.com
   3D Realms: 3d.realms@3drealms.com

Internet Continued...
---------------------

   World Wide Web
   ==============
   Both Apogee & 3D Realms can be reached by pointing your Web Browser to
   'http://www.swcbbs.com'. (without the ' signs)  This URL is technically the
   Software Creations Web BBS.  Once you get to that, log into the Web BBS,
   and from the Main Menu, pick "Home Board Author Web Pages", and there we
   are!  While you're there, make sure to check out the ground breaking
   Software Creations Web BBS.

   Anonymous FTP
   =============
   Apogee: The site is ftp.uml.edu and the directory is /msdos/games/apogee
   Realms: The site is ftp.uml.edu and the directory is /msdos/games/3drealms

   These are standard Anonymous FTP sites.  These are not run by Apogee, they
   are run by the university of Massachussets at Lowell. If you have trouble
   getting in, you'll need to either ask the site manager there, or ask the
   person who wrote your FTP software, or your Internet Service Provider.
   Apogee cannot help with trouble with the FTP site.  However, it's most
   likely the FTP site is just full, or is temporarily down.  Try again
   later if you have problems.

   Usenet News
   ===========
   Apogee & 3D Realms monitor the following conferences for activity.

   alt.games.apogee
   comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc
   comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action

   We also read others, and you might catch some of us out in some of the
   programming groups, but these are always monitored, but if you have
   trouble, you can always send E-Mail, too.

   Apogee/3D Realms Mailing List
   =============================
   The Apogee/3D Realms mailing list is a list where press releases, general
   info, new game release notifications, and other miscelleanous items are
   sent out on.  There is no regular release date on it, it happens from time
   to time.  Usually only when we release something, but that's not the rule.
   If you have Internet E-Mail access, send me E-Mail at this E-Mail address:
   "apogee.software@apogee1.com", and ask to be put on the Internet Mailing
   List.  There is no charge for this service.

5) BBS Networks
   ============
   Apogee has support conferences on several major BBS Networks that we read
   and answer messages on.  3D Realms support is also done in the same
   conferences.  You can reach us on:

   Fidonet         -> Apogee, Gaming, Shareware, & Shareware Support Confs
   Relaynet (Rime) -> Apogee, Games, and Shareware Conferences
   Intelec         -> Apogee, Games, and Shareware Conferences
   ILink           -> Apogee, PC Games, and Shareware Conferences
   U'NI-Net        -> Apogee, PC Games, and Shareware Conferences

   Private messages can be sent via Fido Netmail at 1:124/9006.
   Private messages can be send via routed Rime Mail to 1674 or APOGEE.

   If you are on Fidonet, and carry the Filebone, you can get Apogee files
   from the Filebone!  Grab a current copy of FILEBONE.NA, and look up the
   Apogee FDN for more information regarding the Apogee/3D Realms file areas
   available on the Apogee FDN.  Contact your local Fidonet administration
   for more info on getting these files.
