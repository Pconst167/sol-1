This is just a wild guess, but considering that the Opus support echo is named
MEADOW, I tend to suspect it may have something to do with the phrase "Meadow
Muffin."

I don't speak French, so I don't know if there's an equivalent, but out west,
"Meadow Muffins" are more often called "Cow Chips."
