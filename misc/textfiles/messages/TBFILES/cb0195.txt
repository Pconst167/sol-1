CONTAINS 2 RECIPES

Hi all,
I'm going to try something different with my Southern Living posts.
It's been brought to my attention that due to my using the same
subject header on this series of recipes, some of them are not getting
out. :-(  With Karen's help (thanks a heap, Karen), I've learned how to
post a series of recipes in one message and have OLX split it into
several messages.  If I'd bothered to read the manual I might have
learned how to do this a long time ago, but being the basically lazy
person that I am, I had to learn the hard way.  So from now on, these
will be posted in groups of related recipes much the same way they are
in the magazine articles.  Hopefully, this will go much easier with no
more lost posts.                         Nancy

  Subj: Scottish Nettles
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
I came across these exotic looking dishes in a health food book by Carol
O'Dell, she is Scottish and very proud of the healthy cooking tradition
of her homeland.  I have not tried these but I did have a nettle broth
like this one and was surprised that it was good. 8-) Having traveled
throughout most of Scotland I have a strong respect for their cooking
and ability to live in that beautiful but hard country.  These are good
for vegetarians.

      Title: Scotch Nettle Pudding
 Categories: Vegetable, Scottish, Exotic
   Servings:  4

      1 ga Nettle tops    1 c  Broccoli chopped
      2    Leeks, sliced       1/2 c  Rice

  Gather and wash nettles using heavy gloves.  Wash under running cold
  water. Place all ingredients in a muslin cloth and tie firmly. Boil in
  water with a little sea salt/or kelp until all is soft.  Remove from
  cloth, place on a serving dish and drizzle melted butter over it.

  Nettles can be steamed as a veggie also.  After collecting and washing
  chop into short lengths.  Steam for a few minutes and serve with grated
  white cheese sprinkled on or a swirl of plain yoghurt.

  Nettles are high in iron and a traditional Scots foodstuff.

      Title: Nettle Broth
 Categories: Vegetable, Soups, Scottish, Exotic
   Servings:  4

      4 c  Vegetable or chicken stock	  2 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Pearl barley			     Optional leftover
     12    Steams of nettle			 Mash potatoes for thickening

  Gather nettles while still tender use heavy gloves for this task.  Wash
  well under running water, stems uppermost. Chop finely.  Heat the stock &
  barley, simmer until barley is tender.  Carefully add the nettles and
  simmer again until leaves and stems are soft.  Add lemon juice & serve
  immediately.  Left over mashed potatoes maybe added if additional
  thickening is desired.  Put everything through a blender if a smooth soup
  is desired.

  This green-brown soup is very high in phosphorous and a traditional
  Scottish soup.  Be careful collecting and handling the nettle!

I just started converting another collection of recipes to my
database.  These are categorized by the time of the year to take
advantage of what's in season.  Here's the beginning of the
Spring recipes.  Warning: While they look delicious, they are a
bit heavy on the fat & sauces - you may want to lighten them up
by converting creams to non-fat yogurt, non-fat sour cream, etc.
Enjoy!

Title: Poached Eggs on Asparagus
Categories: Spring, Vegetables
Servings: 1 batch

6          asparagus stalks per 
           -person
           salt
2       T  sweet butter
1       c  cubed smoked ham
           white vinegar (as
           -needed)
2          poached eggs per person
           freshly ground white
           -pepper
2          slices white bread per
           -person
1       c  freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
___--Sauce
1/2     c  melted sweet butter
2       T  finely chopped parsley
1       t  fresh chives, finely
           -minced
           salt & pepper
___--Garnish
           watercress

Choose asparagus stalks of uniform size and thickness.  This
allows them to finish cooking at the same time.  Cut off the
hard bottom, peel the asparagus spears and tie them in bundles
of six.  Bring a large saucepan of water to boil and add 1 T of
salt.  Cook the asparagus for 10 to 15 minutes or until barely
tender.  Drain immediately.  Run under cold water to stop the
cooking and place 6 stalks in each of 6 buttered individual
baking dishes.  In a skillet melt the butter and saute the ham
cubes for 2 or 3 minutes.  If you do not have an egg poacher,
pour water 1 inch deep into a 10-inch skillet.  Add 1 T of white
distilled vinegar per cup of water.  Break the eggs, one at a
time, into a saucer and slip each egg into the simmering water.
Keep the water at a bare simmer and remove the pan from the
heat.  Baste the yolks with the whites 2 or 3 times.  In 5
minutes the eggs should be done.  Drain them.  Trim the whites
with a knife and reserve.  Place 2 poached eggs on each portion
of asparagus.  Season with salt and pepper.  Keep warm.  To make
the sauce, add parsley and chives to the melted butter.  Heat
through.  Taste and season as desired.  Spoon the butter sauce
over each dish.  Serve garnished with crisp watercress.

Title: Chicken breasts in chive cream
Categories: Spring, Chicken
Servings: 4

8       T  sweet butter
2       T  chopped scallions
1/2     lb button mushrooms, whole
           -or quartered large ones
           -wiped, stems removed
           salt
           freshly ground white
           -pepper
6          prepared chicken breasts
           -with skin removed,
           -slightly flattened
1/2     c  concentrated chicken
           -stock*
1       ds lemon juice
1       c  heavy cream
1          Beurre Manie*
2       T  finely chopped chives

* Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  These butter-flour 
balls can be made ahead in advance and stored in a sealed jar in 
the refrigerator for 1 or 2 weeks.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T 
sweet butter on a small flat plate and blend the mixture with a 
fork into a very smooth paste.  Roll the paste into a ball.
In a small skillet, heat 2 T of butter.  Add the scallions and
cook for 2 or 3 minutes without browning.  Add the mushrooms.
Season with salt and pepper and cook the mixture over high heat
for 2 or 3 more minutes to brown the mushrooms lightly.
Reserve.  Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and
sprinkle them with lemon juice.  In a large chicken fryer, melt
the remaining butter.  When it is quite hot, add the chicken
breasts and cook them for 1 minute on each side.  Cover the pan
with buttered wax paper and then the pan lid.  Lower the heat
and simmer the chicken breasts for another 8 to 10 minutes or
until the juices run out pale yellow when pierced with a fork.
Do not overcook or pierce every piece.  Immediately remove the
chicken breasts to a serving platter.  Pour the chicken stock
into the fryer, raise the heat and reduce the stock until it is
almost a glaze.  Add the heavy cream and continue cooking over
high heat.  Add the Beurre Manie and cook until the sauce
heavily coats a spoon.  Add the chives and correct the
seasoning.  Add the mushroom & scallion mixture.  Add the chives
and correct the seasoning.  Pour the sauce over the chicken
breasts and serve at once.  From "Season Kitchen" by Perla
Meyers.

           -horseradish
-----garnish
           boiled parsleyed
           -potatoes

Preheat broiler.  In a large ceramic or glass baking dish, place
the salmon steaks. Bury the dill sprigs among them.  Mix the
olive oil, juice of 1 lemon, salt and pepper in a mixing bowl
and pour it over the salmon steaks.  Cover well with plastic
wrap and place in the bottom part of the refrigerator.  Marinate
for 4 hours, turning the fish steaks once.  Place the cucumber
cubes in a sieve over a bowl and sprinkle with coarse salt.  Let
them drain for at least 30 minutes.  For the sauce, combine the
Creme Fraiche (or sour cream), scallions, minced dill and the
well-drained cucumber in a mixing bowl.  Add the optional
horseradish and vinegar.  The amount of vinegar needed will
depend on the sourness of your Creme Fraiche.  Season the sauce
with salt and pepper and chill.  Drain the salmon steaks and dry
them thoroughly with paper towels.  Put a little of the melted
butter in the bottom of a baking dish, place the salmon steaks
in the dish and dribble with a little more of the butter.  Place
the dish about 3" from the broiler and broil the steaks for 3
minutes, after which dribble the remaining melted butter over
them.  Broil the fish for 2 or 3 more minutes, then carefully
turn the steaks to the other side.  Broil for another 5 minutes.
Be sure not to overcook the salmon or it will be dry and
tasteless.  Remove the salmon steaks from the broiler, sprinkle
with a little lemon juice and serve garnished with the potatoes
and cold sauce.

           paprika
           capers
           dill sprigs
           black olives

Cut the stems off the artichokes as close to the base as
possible.  Remove the first few layers of outer leaves.  When
the leaves become light green and bend forward, cut them off
with a sharp knife close to the base.  Rub the cut parts
immediately with the cut side of 1/2 lemon.  In a large enamel
saucepan, combine the flour, 1 T lemon juice & water.  Bring the
mixture to a boil, add a pinch of salt and the artichoke
bottoms.  Cook them for 20 to 30 minutes or until tender.  Do
not overcook them.  Cool and dry well on paper towels.  As soon
as they are cool enough to handle, remove the choke with a spoon
and trim the artichoke bottoms with a sharp knife.  Pour
vinaigrette over the bottoms.  Cover the bowl and let marinate 2
hours.  Puree the salmon in a blender, add mayonnaise, salt,
white pepper, a touch of cayenne, lemon juice and dill.  Chill
the mixture for 1 hour.  If it seems too thick, thin it out with
a little sour or whipped cream.  The mixture must be quite thick
to stay on the artichoke bottoms.  Drain the artichoke bottoms
and dry well on paper towels.  Top each one with a dome of
salmon mousse.  Sprinkle lightly with paprika.  Make a little
circle of capers on each dome and top each one with 2 tiny
sprigs of dill and a black olive.  Chill again and serve cold
with buttered pumpernickel.  From "Seasonal Kitchen" by Perla
Meyers.

Title: Peas A La Venetienne
Categories: Vegetables, Shrimp, Spring
Servings: 6

3       lb fresh peas, shelled
           salt
1       lb small shrimp
4       T  sweet butter
2       T  finely minced shallots
1       c  cubed proscuitto
           freshly ground white
           -pepper
___--optional
1       t  sugar
-----garnish
           chopped parsley
           grated Parmesan cheese

In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of salted water to boil.  Add
the peas and simmer uncovered for 5 to 7 minutes or until barely
tender.  (If you are using large peas, add a little sugar to the
water.)  Drain the peas and run them under cold water.  In a
2-quart saucepan, bring salted water to a boil.  Add the shrimp
and when the water returns to a boil, cook them for 3 to 5
minutes.  The shrimp should be pink.  Run them immediately under
cold water and peel.  In a large skillet, melt the butter and
add the shallots.  Cook for 2 or 3 minutes until tender but not
browned.  Add the shrimp and shake the pan to coat them evenly
with the butter.  Add the peas and the proscuitto and heat
through.  Correct the seasoning.  Sprinkle with parsley and
serve immediately with a bowl of Parmesan cheese on the side.

Title: Spring Cream of Curried Asparagus Soup
Categories:  Vegetables, Soup, Spring
Servings: 4

1       lb fresh asparagus
5       c  chicken stock
           salt
4       T  sweet butter
4       T  flour
1       t  curry powder, up to...
2       t
3/4     c  heavy cream
           freshly ground white
           -pepper
3          egg yolks
1       ds lemon juice

Remove the woody ends from the asparagus stalks.  Clean the
stalks with a vegetable peeler, cut off the tips and reserve.
Place the chicken stock and asapargus stalks in a 3-quart
casserole.  Bring the stock to a boil, reduce the heat and
simmer covered for 40 to 45 minutes.  While the soup is
simmering, drop the asparagus tips into fast-boiling lightly
salted water and cook them for 3 to 5 minutes or until tender.
Drain and reserve.  Purree the stock and asparagus stalks in the
blender and reserve.  Keep warm.  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan,
melt the butter, add the flour and cook for 2 minutes without
letting it brown.  Add the pureed stock all at once and bring
the soup to a boil.  Cook over low heat until it thickens and
lightly coats a spoon.  Mix the curry powder with a little cream
in a small mixing bowl and add it to the soup together with the
asparagus tips.  Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as
needed.  Just before serving, mix the remaining cream and egg
yolks in a small bowl and add the mixture to the soup with a
dash of lemon juice.  Reheat the soup without letting it come to
a boil and serve it very hot.  (This might work better in the
top of a double-boiler.)  Variation:  Omit curry and add 2 T of
finely minced fresh herbs; like chives, chervil or dill.  From
"Seasonal Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Season spareribs with salt and

brown them on all sides over medium heat so as not to burn the
oil.  Remove spareribs and reserve.  Brown the sausages in the
pan fat until they are nice and crisp.  Remove and reserve.
Discard all but 2 T of fat from the pan.  Add garlic and onion
to the pan and cook until lightly browned (not burnt).  Add the
peppers and tomatoes, salt, pepper & cayenne.  Return the
spareribs to the casserole, cover the pan and cook the mixture
over low heat for 45 to 50 minutes.  Uncover the casserole and
cook the mixture for 10 minutes more.  In the meantime, wash the
rice thoroughly and drain.  Add rice to the casserole together
with the saffrom and a good pinch of salt.  Cover with water.
Bring to a boil, cover the casserole and place in the oven.
Bake the rice without stirring for 25 minutes.  While the rice
is baking, melt the butter in a small skillet.  Add the
mushrooms and cook them for 3 minutes until they are evenly
browned.  Season with salt and pepper.  Uncover the rice and add
the mushrooms.  Toss with the rice using 2 forks.  If the rice
is not tender and the liquid has not completely evaporated, bake
the rice uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes more.  In the last few
minutes add the sausages to the casserole and heat them through.
 Remove the rice from the oven, garnish with hard-boiled eggs
and pimiento strips and serve directly from casserole.  From

Bouillon: Combine all bouillon ingredients, except scallops, in
an enamel casserole.  Bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer
covered for 20 minutes.  Add the scallops, cover the casserole
and simmer for 5 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove the

Strain rest of bouillon and reduce it over high heat to 1 1/2
cups. 
Sauce: In a mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks with the dry
and the Dijon mustards.  Add the heavy cream and whisk until the
mixture is well blended.  In a heavy saucepan, heat 4 T butter.
When it is very hot, add the flour and cook it for 2 or 3
minutes, stirring constantly.  Be sure not to brown it.  Add the
1 1/2 cups hot bouillon (reserved above) and whisk the mixture
until it thickens.  Simmer the sauce for 8 to 10 minutes,
whisking it several times.  Add the egg and cream mixture; do
not let the sauce come to a boil or it will curdle.  Off the
heat, add the lemon juice, salt and pepper, and beat in 2 T
butter.
Place the scallops in a serving dish together with the cooked,
well-drained vegetables.  Pour the sauce over the entire dish,
sprinkle with mixed herbs and serve.  From "Seasonal Kitchen" by

                Asparagus in Lemon 'n' Herb Sauce

20         asparagus stalks up to..
30         stalks
3          egg yolks
1       t  cornstarch
1          lemon, juice of
1       c  warm chicken stock
           salt and freshly ground
           -white pepper to taste
___--optional
1       T  finely minced chives
1       T  finely minced dill

Clean the asparagus, removing the tough ends.  Tie the stalks in
bundles.  Bring 3 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large
casserole.  Drop the asparagus into the boiling water and cook
until tender; be sure not to overcook.  The stalks should still
be slightly crisp.  As soon as the asparagus is done, run it
under cold water.  Keep warm while making the sauce.  In a small
heavy saucepan, combine the egg yolks and cornstarch.  Add the
lemon juice and whisk until the mixture is quite smooth.  Add
the warm stock and place the saucepan over medium heat.  Cook
the sauce until it is quite thick, whisking vigorously all the
time.  As soon as the sauce has the consistency of a custard,
remove the saucepan immediately from the heat and continue
whisking until the sauce has cooled.  Season the sauce with salt
and pepper and add the chives & dill (optional).  Place the
asparagus on a serving platter and spoon the sauce over it
without covering the tips.  Serve immediately.  From "Seasonal
Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.

                        Danish Crab Salad

1       lb lump crabmeat
2          cucumbers
           salt
2       c  sliced radishes
           lemon juice to taste

3          hard-boiled eggs, sliced
           whole radishes

Pick over the crabmeat to remove bones.  Peel the cucumbers,
halve them lengthwise and scrape out the seeds.  (This is best
done with a grapefruit spoon or a melon-ball cutter.)  Cut the 
cucumbers into fine 1" matchsticks and put them in a colander.
Sprinkle with salt and let them drain for one hour.  Dry then
with paper towels.  Put the crabmeat into a salad bowl.  Add the
radishes and cucumbers.  Sprinkle with lemon juice, salt and
pepper.  Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, chives,
horseradish.  (Squeeze the liquid out of the horseradish in the
corner of a napkin.)  Carefully combine the dressing with the
salad.  Chill well before serving.  Garnish the bowl with sliced
eggs, radishes and watercress.  Serve with thin-sliced buttered
black bread.  From "Seasonal Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.

  Subj: Stromboli and calzon
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
GW>  AC> A stromboli is a filled turnover made by filling pizza dough with
GW>  AC> cheese, sauces, etc. It's folded in half (half moon shaped) and then
GW>  AC> baked. A calzone is the same except it's deep fried instead of baked.

GW> Ok, that's a new one on me.  I have a feeling this could be as big a fuss
GW> as chilli.  Should we add if these (and pizza) should be eaten with the
GW> hands or knife and fork.  I personally have never seen a calzone fried.
GW> What you call a stromboli is my calzone except the sauce is more often
GW> dumped over the calzone than baked inside.

Here in NY (at least), a calzone is more like the filled turnover
described above, while a stromboli looks more like a jelly-roll.

Here's a recipe for calzone, adapted from "A Taste of Italy" by
Antonio Carluccio (ISBN 0-316-12858-9). The instructions are a bit
vague at times, but that's fairly typical of REAL Italian cooking
<g>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Calzone Imbottito (Stuffed Pizza)

(makes 4 calzone)

1 lb pizza dough (use your own recipe, or substitute 1 lb frozen
pizza dough. If you're really desperate, frozen bread dough will
work...)


Filling:
  4 oz mozzarella
  1C ricotta
  4 oz cooked ham
  2 T freshly grated Parmesan cheese
  2 eggs, beaten
  4 fresh basil leaves, chopped
  salt and freshly ground black pepper
  a little milk for glazing

1. Make the dough as described in the basic recipe
2. Cut the mozzarella and the ham into strips.
3. Beat the eggs (keeping a little aside for sealing the dough
   envelopes) and add the Parmesan cheese, basil, a pinch of salt
   and 2 or 3 grinds of black pepper. Mix this in with the ricotta,,
   mozzarella and ham so as to form a reasonably soft paste.
4. Preheat the oven to 425 F (220 C)
5. Divide the dough into 4 balls. Flatten these one at a time,
   forming a small pizza 1/2 inch thick.
6. Place these on a dry cloth and put a quarter of the filling on
   half of each pizza.  Cover the filling by folding the pizza in
   half, and seal it by wetting the edge with a little beaten egg
   and pressing a fork on the join.
7. Brush the dough over with a little milk.
8. Place the calzone on a well-oiled baking tray and bake for about
   15 minutes, until golden brown.

I don't have a recipe for stromboli, but I DO make a mean sausage
bread which is very close to it, if you're interested...

 Have a look at where they keep the peanut butter, in Aus it's usually

      Title: Polo Havidge Loobia (Rice Pilau With Carrot And Red Kidne
 Categories: Rice, Beans, Vegetarian, Persian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/3 c  Dried red kidney beans
    1/2 lb Carrots, cut into 1/4-in
           -cubes
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 tb Corn oil
  4 1/4 c  Water
      2 c  Raw rice, covered with
           -lightly salted water
           -for 1/2 hour
      1 md Potato, peeled and cut into
    1/4    -in thick slices
      1 tb Water
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  There are variations of variations in the artful combinations of
  Persian rice.  Here is one that, with very few ingredients, manages to
  encompass a wide range of seasonings and flavors.
  
  1.  Cover the beans with water and soak them overnight.  Drain.  Cover
  the beans with water again and cook, covered, over moderate heat until
  they are soft but still whole, about 1/2 hour.  Drain and set aside.
  
  2.  Put the carrots, sugar, 1 tablespoon of the oil, and 1/4 cup of
  the water into a pan and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, or until
  the liquid evaporates.  Be careful not to burn the carrots.  Set
  aside.
  
  3.  Bring the remaining 4 cups of water to a boil in a pan.  Drain
  nearly all the water from the rice and add the rice to the boiling
  water.  Cover the pan and cook over moderate heat for 10 minutes.
  Drain, run the rice under cold water, and drain again.
  
  4.  Put 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a pan large enough to
  spread out the potato slices flat on its bottom.  Sprinkle over this
  the 1 tablespoon of water.  All the other ingredients are to be added
  in layers as follows: Add 1/2 cup of the rice over the potatoes.
  Cover this with the carrots and a few sprinkling of the cinnamon.
  Cover with the beans.  Continue in this manner, one layer after
  another, ending with beans.  Sprinkle cinnamon lightly over each
  layer.  Shape the top layer into a pyramid.
  
  5.  Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.  Sprinkle the
  balance of the oil (2 tablespoons) over the top and cover the pan with
  paper kitchen towels and the pan cover.  Continue to cook over low
  heat for 15 minutes more.  The rice, carrots, and beans will be cooked
  through and the potato and oil will develop their own crisp crust on
  the bottom.
  
  Serve warm.  Serve 4 to 6 with other dishes.

  Subj: Venison Ragout CR
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Hi Earl,

Since I knew that you like wild game recipes, I thought that I would
post this one to you. It may seem a little strange to you, but here
in California, we don't serve ragouts with beans mixed in. On the
side perhaps, but never mixed in. It just goes against the code of
the west. <G>


      Title: Venison Ragout With Red Onions (L A Times)
 Categories: Game, Stew, L a times
      Yield: 6 servings

    1/4 c  Flour
  1 1/4 ts Salt
           Pepper, fresh ground
      2 lb Venison stew meat, trimmed,
           - cut into 3/4-inch cubes
      2 tb Butter
           Oil
      1 lg Red onion, thinly sliced
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
  1 1/4 c  Ruby Port
  1 1/4 c  Beef broth
      1 c  Dried cranberries
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
           Dash allspice
    1/2 lb Small mushrooms, trimmed &
           - quartered
           Typed by Manny Rothstein

     Ragouts are thick, well-seasoned stews. Here, the
  ragout is a tart-sweet mix of venison, ruby Port and
  dried cranberries, perfect seasonal dinner party food.
  Stewing beef can be substituted for the venison.

     Combine flour, salt and pepper in plastic food bag.
  Pat meat dry with paper towels. Toss meat with
  seasoned flour until evenly coated, shaking off excess
  flour. Remove meat and put remaining seasoned flour
  into 1 1/2 quart casserole.
     Heat 2 ts of butter and 2 tb oil in 12-inch
  non-stick skillet. When very hot, sear meat in 2
  batches on all sides, about 1 1/2 minutes, adding
  another 2 ts butter and oil as needed. Transfer seared
  meat to casserole. Toss meat with flour in casserole.
     Heat 2 more ts of butter and 2 more ts of oil in
  same skillet over medium high heat. When hot, add
  onion and garlic. Cook until onion is tender, about 4
  minutes. Add Port, beef broth, dried cranberries,
  sugar and allspice. Bring to boil. Pour over venison.
  Toss to mix well.
     Bake, covered, on center oven rack 1 1/2 hours at
  350 deg. Add mushrooms. Mix well. Continue to bake,
  covered, until meat is tender, about 30 to 60 min.
  longer. Adjust seasonings to taste. Can be made a day
  ahead and refrigerated or frozen up to 3 months.
  Reheat gently. Serve hot, spooned over mashed root
  vegetables (see recipe). Makes 6 servings.
