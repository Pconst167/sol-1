      So, you want the day off.  Let's take a look at what you are asking
for...

        There are 365 days per year available for work.  There
are 52 weeks per year in which you already have 2 days off per
week, leaving 261 days available for work.  Since you spend 16
hours each day away from work, you have used up 170 days, leaving
91 days available.  You spend 30 minutes each day on coffee break
that accounts for 23 days each year, leaving only 68 days available.
With a one hour lunch period each day, you have used up another
48 days leaving only 22 days available for work.  You normally
spend 2 days per year on sick leave.  This leaves you only 20 days
available for work.  We offer 5 statutory holidays per year, so
your available working time is down to 15 days.  We so generously
give you 14 days vacation per year which leaves you only 1 day
available for work and I'll be DARNED if your going to take that
day off!!
