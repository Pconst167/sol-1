Title: Addictive Cream of Broccoli Soup
Categories: Soup, Broccoli, Butter, Cream, Cheese Servings:  4

      2    fresh broccoli (each about
           - 3-in. bottom diameter)
    1/2 lb butter
      2 to 6 cloves garlic, chopped
      1 tb Chervil (fresh/dried
           - chopped)
      1 ts salt
      1 ts white pepper
      3 c  milk (full-cream milk)
      1 md egg yolk, beaten
    1/4 c  flour
    1/8 ts cardamom
    1/8 ts mace
      1 c  heavy cream (whipping)
    1/3 c Gruyere cheese
          - (fresh, grate fine)
    1/3 c parmesan cheese
          - (grate to powder)


 (1) Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces. Discard the hard stem pieces,
     but keep tender leaves and stem parts.

 (2) Steam the cut broccoli for about 5-8 minutes, until just bright
     green in color. Do not over-cook.

 (3) In a 10-inch enameled (non-metal) skillet, heat 6 oz of butter
     until melted. Add chopped garlic and wait until butter is hot
     enough to cook in. Add steamed broccoli, then chervil to the
     skillet. Lightly salt the broccoli.

 (4) Cover, and cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally with a
     wooden spoon, for another 5-10 minutes or until the broccoli turns
     a darker green color and becomes very soft.

 (5) Mash the broccoli right in the skillet until no large pieces
     remain.  Use a potato masher or a strong wooden spoon. Mash until
     there are no pieces remaining that are too big to fit in a soup
     spoon.

 (6) While broccoli is cooking, add beaten egg yolk to 2 cups of milk.

 (7) Put 3 Tbsp butter into a 2-3 quart saucepan. Use enamel or glass
     for best soup flavor. Metal pans will make this soup bitter. Melt
     butter and add flour. When the flour bubbles and starts to cook,
     add the egg/milk mixture into the saucepan. Add the cardamom, mace,
     and white pepper. Stir conents of saucepan constantly with wooden
     spoon until thick. Lower the cooking heat.

 (8) Empty the mashed broccoli mixture into the sau- cepan. Stir until
     well-mixed. Slowly stir in the remaining milk and the cream. As
     soon as the soup becomes hot enough to cook again, add the grated
     cheeses.

 (9) Turn the heat down lower and simmer for about 5 more minutes,
     stirring to allow the cheeses to melt and mix while the table is
     being set. Serve immediately and retire quickly so as not to be
     trampled by those who smelled it cooking.

NOTES: This recipe may be doubled, halved or whatever without penalty.
       Vary the amount of milk added the second time to change the soup
       thickness to your own tastes. You also may use any fresh green
       vegetable as a substitute for the broccoli. Asparagus tips,
       artichoke hearts, and corn are especially nice. Cook them in the
       same way as you did the broccoli. Use any leftover butter on the
       hard French finger rolls.

Hi there All,
 Someone passed this on to me on one of the chat echo's, hope someone
 likes it :)
 Just one question while I am here, is anyone using a scanner?  I have
 an Abaton FB but since it was my brothers and he has an Apple, I need
 to find an interface card.  They tell me here in Aust that they don't
 make them anymore, but if anyone can help me out with info it would be
 much appreciated.  Ok, you can have the recipe now :)

Title: 'Recipe for Salad' by Sydney Smith
Keywords: salad, fun

   To make this condiment, your poet begs
   The pounded yellow of two hard-boiled eggs,
   Two boiled potatoes, passed through kitchen-sieve,
   Smoothness and softness to the salad give;
   Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl,
   And, scarce-suspected, animate the whole.
   Of mordant mustard add a single spoon,
   Distrust the condiment that bites so soon;
   But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault,
   To add a double quantity of salt.
   And, lastly, o'er the flavoured compound toss
   A magic soup-spoon of anchovy sauce.
   Oh, green and glorious! Oh, herbaceous treat!
   'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat;
   Back to the world he'd turned his fleeting soul,
   And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl!
   Serenely full, the epicure would say,
   Fate cannot harm me, for I have dined today.

There ... a rhyming recipe for your collection - what more could you ask for
<grin>.

Alan.

Hi Dave!

  >build our MM recipes and would like any and all American Indian dishes

The book I'm posting this from has other recipes in the chapter.  I'm
just not sure if they're authentic.  Some of the ingredients seem very
wrong, unless they've been adapted.  These two short blurbs were quotes
from the Indian students at the Carlise Indian School in Pennsylvania.
I gather it was enough to be a recipe.   -Pat

Molasses Candy:  "2 cups of molasses, 1 cup of sugar, 1 Tbsp. vinegar,
butter the size of a walnut, boil 20 minutes, stir all the time, put it
to cold, then eat it."  Morning Star, February, 1885

Apple Pie:  " How to made pie, 2 handfull of flour and two pinches of
salt and just a little water enough to make it wet and get the
rolling-pin and kneading it and put it in the pie pan, and some apple in
it, and put it in the oven."  Morning Star, June 1884

Anyway, this one's a little different, but it gets rave reviews.  The original
recipe called for sour cream, but I love the taste with yogurt.  One caveat -
when using yogurt, you need to thicken it up or the cake will never bake
through.  Put 1 1/2 cups of yogurt in a yogurt funnel or a sieve lined with two
layers of cheesecloth and let it drain off 1/2 cup of liquid before you start.

Sour Cream White Cake

8 oz sour cream
1/4 c milk
1 c softened butter
2 c sugar
4 eggs
2 3/4 c flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp amaretto or 1/4 tsp almond extract

Combine sour cream and milk (Or yogurt and milk.)

Cream butter and sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly between
additions.

Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.  Add to creamed butter
alternately with sour cream/milk mixture in three additions, beginning and
ending with flour mixture.  Stir in vanilla and amaretto or almond extract.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.

Pour batter into prepared pans and bake for 35-45 minutes, until a toothpick
inserted in the center of cake comes out clean.  Cool in pans 10 minutes before
removing to wire racks.  Cool completely before frosting.

     This'll be the last batch, unless you've some specific requests

previous as well as one of today's recipes specifies 'farmer's

Title:  CURD CHEESE (GERMAN QUARK, AUSTRIAN TOPFEN)
Keywords:  Cheese, Curds, Quark, Topfen, Austrian, German, Dairy

4 tbsp     plain yogurt or wine vinegar, or
                5 tbsp lemon juice
2 qts      milk (homogenized gives good results)

   You will need a saucepan, a bowl, and a sieve.  If using yogurt,
bring the milk to a boil and then leave it to cool to finger
temperature (100 F).  Mix with milk with the yogurt in a basin.  Put
in a warm place for 4 to 5 hours to set as solid as yogurt.

   If using vinegar or lemon juice, stir into the milk and bring it
to a near boil (200 F) in a bowl set in a saucepan of water.  Remove
and keep in a warm place for 4 to 5 hours.

   Pour the mixture into a sieve lined with a scalded clean cloth.
After an hour put a plate on top to weight and encourage the whey to
drip through.  The curds in the cloth are the cheese.  Cover and
store in a cool pantry, and it will keep for about a week.  Drink
the whey, flavored with fruit juice, for your health - or use to to
make scones.  Keep in refrigerator and eat within 2 days.

Yield:  1/2 lb

Title:  AUSTRIAN BREAD DUMPLINGS
Keywords:  Dumplings, Austrian

4 oz       dry bread, diced
1/2 oz     (1 Tbsp) butter or lard
1          egg
1/2 cup    milk
3 oz       (3/4 cup) flour
           salt and pepper
1 Tbsp     chopped fresh herbs (parsley, chervil, marjoram) -
                optional, but a great improvement

   You will need a frying pan, a large and a small bowl, and a
saucepan of water or soup.  Fry the diced bread lightly in the
fat in a frying pan.  Meanwhile, mix the egg and the milk in a
small bowl.  Tip the contents of the frying pan into a large
bowl, and pour the egg and milk over all.  Stir in the flour, and
season with salt and pepper.  Add the herbs, if using.  You may
need more milk to make a soft dough.  Allow it to stand for 1/2
an hour.

   Dip your hand into cold water and roll the mixture into a
dozen small balls.  Put a pot of salted water on to boil, if
there isn't a simmering soup pot waiting.  Drop little balls of
dough into the boiling salted water or the soup.  Poach them for
10 to 15 minutes, until they are light and firm and well risen.

Yield:  12 dumplings
Time:  1 hour

Notes:  You may include chopped fried bacon or cubed pork
        cracklings in the mixture.  Leaving out flour will result
        in a lighter dumpling.

Title:  FRUIT BREAD (KLETZENBROT)
Keywords:  Bread, Fruit, Dried, Nuts, Traditional, Austrian

Dough:
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 tsp    salt
1 oz       fresh yeast or 1/2 oz dry yeast
1 cup      warm milk
1 oz       sugar
4 tbsp     butter or lard

Filling:
1/2 lb     hazelnuts and/or walnuts
3/4 lb     dried pears or pitted prunes (dried plums)
1/2 cup    sugar
1          egg

   You will need a small bowl, a large bowl, a rolling pin, and a
baking sheet.  Put the dried fruit to soak in a little water
while you make the dough.  Put the flour in a warm bowl and make
a well in the center.  Mix the yeast to a liquid in half a cupful
of the warm milk.  Pour the yeast liquid into the well in the
flour and sprinkle a handful of flour over the top.  Put aside
for 15 minutes in a wam, draft-proof corner for the eyast to
develop and set the sponge - a process you can watch if you wish:
The yeast, activated by warmth and fed by the starch in the milk
and the flour, multiplies its cells and makes oxygen until the
surface skin of flour is covered with spongy bubbles.  This gets
the yeast working well and is a step which should not be left
out.

   When the sponge is set, melt the butter or lard.  Sprinkle the
sugar and salt over the flour.  Beat in the liquid butter or lard
(it should not be hot, just warm) and as much of the rest of the
warm milk as you need to make a smooth, elastic dough.  The
amount of liquid you require will naturally also depend on the
liquid additions.  Pummel the dough thoroughly to stretch the
gluten.

   Knead the dough into a soft white cushion with your fists.
Let it rise for about 40 to 50 minutes in a damp, warm, draft-
proof place such as an unlit oven over a tray of boiling water or
inside a plastic bag in the cupboard.

   When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead
thoroughly to distribute the oxygen bubbles.  Roll the dough out
very thin and cut into 16 to 20 squares.

   Chop the nuts and the fruit together, and mix in the sugar and
the egg.  Put a pile of the nut and fruit filling onto each
square of pastry dough.  Dampen the edges of the pastry and fold
over the edges.  Turn them so that the seams are underneath.
Butter a baking tray and put the buns on it, well spaced to allow
them room to rise.  Put the tray of buns somewhere warm and
draft-free to rise for half an hour (in an unlit oven over a
baking tray full of hot water).

   Preheat oven to 350F.  ((Note: Not while the pastry is rising
in it, I would think))

   Bake the buns for 30 to 40 minutes, until they are well risen
and golden.  While they are still warm, brush them with a syrup
of sugar and water (3 spoonfuls of each melted together).  They
are delicious for tea.

Yield:  16 to 20 little buns
Time:   Start 2 hours ahead; 30 minutes plus 30 to 40
        minutes cooking

     In plum season, even the fancy Viennese pastry shops are apt to
have plum tart...

Title:  PLUM TART (ZWETSCHKENFLECK)
Keywords:  Tart, Cake, Austrian, Fruit

Dough:
1 lb       (3 1/2 cups) all purpose flour
1/2 tsp    salt
1 oz       fresh yeast or 1/2 oz dry yeast
1 cup      warm milk
2 oz       (4 tbsp) butter or lard
1 oz       sugar

Filling:
2 lbs      plums
1/4 lb     (1/2 cup) sugar; more if the fruit is very sour

   You will need a large bowl, a rolling pin, and a baking sheet.
Put the flour in a warm bowl and make a well in the center.  Mix
the yeast to a liquid in half a cupful of the warm milk.  Pour
the yeast liquid into the well in the flour and sprinkle a
handful of flour over the top.  Put aside for 15 minutes in a
wam, draft-proof corner for the eyast to develop and set the
sponge - a process you can watch if you wish: The yeast,
activated by warmth and fed by the starch in the milk and the
flour, multiplies its cells and makes oxygen until the surface
skin of flour is covered with spongy bubbles.  This gets the
yeast working well and is a step which should not be left out.

   When the sponge is set, melt the butter or lard.  Sprinkle the
sugar and salt over the flour.  Beat in the liquid butter or lard
(it should not be hot, just warm) and as much of the rest of the
warm milk as you need to make a smooth, elastic dough.  The
amount of liquid you require will naturally also depend on the
liquid additions.  Pummel the dough thoroughly to stretch the
gluten.

   Knead the dough into a soft white cushion with your fists.
Let it rise for about 40 to 50 minutes in a damp, warm, draft-
proof place such as an unlit oven over a tray of boiling water or
inside a plastic bag in the cupboard.

   When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead
thoroughly to distribute the oxygen bubbles.  Roll the dough out
in a circle (or a square, a very usual way of presenting this
pie) as thin as for a shortcrust pastry.  Butter a baking sheet
and lay the yeast pastry on it.  Let it rise again for 15 to 20
minutes until the dough is quite puffed up.  When the dough has
risen, prick it all over with a fork.

   Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450F and prepare the fruit.
Pit the plums neatly without cutting them right through, then
place them on end on the dough - then you can be sure they will
be tightly packed.  ((Note: Skin-side down, or that's the only
way I have ever seen it made.))  Lay a thick layer of fruit over
the whole surface.  Sprinkle with sugar.

   Put the tart to bake for 25 to 30 minutes.  When you open the
oven door, the tart will look distinctly singed.  Don't worry; It
will be fragrant, juicy, and delicious.  Slip out onto a large
dish.  Serve the country tart warm.

Yield:  Makes 1 large tart.
Time:   Start 2 hours ahead;  30 minutes plus 50 minutes cooking.

CONTAINS RECIPE

     This, as mentioned yesterday, is from a German magazine and
purports to be the original recipe of Heiner's Kardinalschnitten
pastry. Heiner is one of the premier Cafe-Konditoreien
(a business that bakes its own pastries and serves them as well as
coffee, hot chocolate, fruit juices, soft drinks and such) in
Vienna, and the Cardinal's Slices are one of their specialties.
(There are variations of the pastry, as I've had coffee-flavored
Cardinal's Slices elsewhere, which some people prefer, but I
don't.  I think the coffee-flavored ones had a coffee cream in between
the layers, in place of the apricot preserves, and Batter 2 may also
have had some coffee flavor.  Personally, I've always preferred the
Heiner version.)

     It's a very long recipe, so I split it into two parts.

     Also, it's a very intricate recipe, and one would do well to
visualize every step a few times beforehand.  Like, even if I
halved the recipe, I suspect my "large" cookie sheet would be
woefully too small.

Title:  KARDINALSCHNITTE (CARDINAL'S SLICES) PART 1 OF 2
Keywords:  Heiner, Pastry, Eggwhite, Apricot, Viennese, Austrian

   The quantities listed are sufficient for a good-size crowd!
Because:  Sponge cakes using beaten eggwhites always are better
if made in larger quantities.  Our forebears knew that, hence so
many of the old recipes start out with 'take 24 eggs'.  We have
learned to cut back - if you wish to halve the recipe, do so.  But,
don't expect results that can match Konditorei Heiner's expecta-
tions...  This pastry tastes best about 3 to 4 hours after baking.
They will keep for one day; if you want to store them longer than
that, package them individually and freeze them.

BATTER 1:
200 g      egg yolks
200 g      whole eggs
200 g      sugar
200 g      flour
1 pinch    salt
1          large pinch vanilla sugar
           grated peel of 1 untreated lemon OR 1 pkg "Citro-back"

BATTER 2:
900 g      egg whites
580 g      sugar

           confectioners' sugar for dusting
150 g      apricot preserves [jelly?  It needs to be piped later. K.B.]

Batter 1:
   Combine egg yolks and eggs with sugar and whisk until thick
and whitish (but short of stiff peaks).  Carefully fold in the
other ingredients and flavorings.

Batter 2:
   Beat the egg whites, without salt, until foamy [to stiff
peak stage, I would think.  K.B.], very gradually drizzling
in the sugar.  Beat until sugar is totally dissolved.

Shaping/Baking:

   [Preheat oven - see below for temperatures.  K.B.]

   You will need a pastry chef's pastry bag for piping the
batter.  The pastry bags sold for average household use will not
suffice!  Line a large cookie sheet with baking parchment, and -
using the big nozzle - pipe Batter 2 in threee equally long
strips, at about 15 mm [not quite 2/3 inch] distance from each
other.  Pipe a total of four times 3 strips [from the
illustrations, with a little bit more separation between each set
of 3 strips.  Eventually, each set of 3 strips will become a top
or bottom layer of the finished product.  K.B.]  If you end up
with some of Batter 2 left over, pipe a thin second layer on top
of the layers you already have, like a cap.

     Fill the pastry bag with Batter 1, and pipe in [the two open
spaces] between [each set of three Batter 2 strips].  Lightly
dust with confectioners' sugar, which will dissolve immediately.
Put into the preheated oven immediately:  In a convection oven,
for 20 minutes at 200 degrees Centigrade [392 degrees F], in a
normal oven at 220 degrees Centigrade [428 degrees F] and turn
down to 180 degrees Centrigrade [356 degrees F] after five
minutes.  After half the baking time, reverse baking sheets
so the ends of the cake will brown evenly.

Finishing:
   Complete assembly while still hot!  Immediately after removing
from oven, turn upside down and pull off baking parchment from
bottom of cake.  On half of the layers, pipe apricot preserves
[jelly?] through the fine nozzle lengthwise onto the yellow
strips.  Pull the other half of the cake as close as possible,
and nimbly flip the bottom of that other half [where previous was
the baking parchment] onto the layer with the apricot preserves,
trying for as close a match up as possible.  Firmly (but without
squishing) wrap the cake into the paper and let it cool down.

    [After it has cooled, unwrap - I would think.  K.B.]  Dust
with confectioners' sugar and cut into slices, constantly dipping
the knife into hot water in between cuts.  [Heiner's pastry is
cut into slices that are about 40 to 50 mm - 1 5/8 to 2 inches -
wide, if memory serves.  K.B.]

     Hint:  Vanilla sugar consists of sugar and natural vanilla.
Vanillin sugar however is sugar and artificial flavor.  Vanilla
sugar is available in good stores, or you can make it yourself:
In an enclosed jar, store a scraped out or new and sliced open
vanilla bean and some sugar for several weeks.  This process can
be repeated two to four times.  The little seeds from inside the
pod may be mixed with the sugar.

   Note:  It is recommended that you divide the recipe, as the
average household does not have bowls large enough for this much
batter.

1/4 tsp    salt
2 Tbsp     vegetable oil, plus oil to grease the dough
1          egg

*Note:  If you do not wish to make your own strudel dough, you
        will need 2 pkgs filo dough and 8 Tbsp sweet butter

Filling:
9 Tbsp     softened butter
1/2 cup +  1 Tbsp granulated sugar
4          eggs, separated, at room temperature
1 cup      farmer cheese
2 cups     sour cream
1/4 cup    flour
           zest of 1 lemon, grated

Royal topping:
1 cup      milk
2          whole eggs
3 Tbsp     granulated sugar

   1.  For the dough, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.
 With an electric beater, blend the 2 tablespoons oil, the egg,
and 2/3 cup water.  Combine with the dry ingredients, mixing to a
smooth paste.
   2.  Throw the mixture on a table surface and knead firmly for 4
to 5 minutes, until the dough no longer sticks to the table surface.
   3.  Shape the sough into a round bread form, smear thoroughly
with oil, wrap in cloth napkin, and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
   4.  If you are using packaged filo dough, melt the 8
tablespoons of butter and set aside.
   5.  To prepare the filling, in a large bowl, cream the butter
and granulated sugar with an electric beater.
   6.  Beat in the egg yolks, farmer cheese, and sour cream.  Add
the flour and continue beating for 1 minute.  Whisk in the lemon
zest and salt.
   7.  In a separate bowl, beat the eggwhites and vanilla sugar
to a stiff meringue.  Carefully fold the meringue into the cheese
filling,  Gently stir in the raisins and set aside.
   8.  For the topp;ing, blend the milk, eggs, and sugar, and set
aside.
   9.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and grease a jelly-roll
pan with butter.
   10.  Place a tablecloth over a table, dust it with flour, and
roll out the dough as thinly as possible over the cloth until it
becomes a translucent rectangle about 3 x 2 ft.  If using the
filo dough, lay the top sheet on the tablecloth, brush with some
of the 8 tablespoons melted butter, and top with the next sheet,
Continue through both packages.  (There are 4 sheets in a
package.)
   11.  Cover the dough with the prepared filling, leaving an
inch border on all four sides.  Fold in the left and right sides
of the dough, lift the cloth, then roll the dough in the
tablecloth into a strudel form.
   12.  Place the strudel in the prepared pan, brush with the 4
tablespoons melted butter, and bake for 10 minutes, until the
strudel is crisp.  Lower the oven temperature gto 350 degrees F.
Spoon the topping over the strudel and cover the strudel with
aluminum foil, pierced with several holed.  Bake for 30 minutes.
   13.  Cut the strudel into portions and serve warm, sprinkled
with powdered sugar and accompanied by Vanilla Sauce.

Serves 12.

     The previous Milchrahmstrudel recipe was a bit longer than I
remembered, so I ended up having to take out the paragraphs
between the steps to keep it under 100 lines.  It'll read a lot
easier if you edit them back in.

     Also, Milchrahmstrudel is best when still warm from the oven.
It's usually a dessert, but in home cooking may well show up as a
main course.

CONTAINS RECIPE

     A very famous dessert one must always wait for - it's served
fresh from the oven!   (The few time I've had it, it just came
dusted with confectioners's sugar, without any sauce.)

Title:  SALZBURGER NOCKERLN
Keywords:  Nockerln, Dessert, Meringue, Austrian, Viennese

4 tsp      unsalted butter
4 tsp      currant or grape jelly
           whites of 9 large eggs, at room temperature
1/2 cup    vanilla sugar
           zest of 1/2 lemon, grated
           yolks of 4 eggs
1/4 cup    granulated sugar
1/2 cup    sifted all purpose flour

   1.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

   2.  Place four 9-inch oval au gratin dishes (or one large oval
glass lasagna pan) on a baking sheet.  In each small dish place 1
teaspoon of butter and 1 teaspoon of jelly.  (If you are using a
lasagna pan, smear the bottom with the butter and then with the
jelly.

   3.  Combine the egg whites, vanilla sugar, and lemon zest in a
large metal bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer at high speed
until stiff peaks form.

   4.  Beat the egg yolks with the granulated sugar.  Gently fold
the egg yolks and flour into the meringue.  Use a spatula to
place three large mounds of the mixture into each au gratin dish.
Smooth the surface of each and bake for 8 minutes, until puffed
and golden.

   5.  Serve immediately.  This is especially good with Vanilla
Sauce, warm Chocolate Sauce, or cold Strawberry Sauce (recipes
separately).

Serves 4.

CONTAINS RECIPE

     This is one of the "alternate" types of Schnitzel I alluded to
in an earlier message.  I can't remember whether anybody sent you this
recipe or not.  Anyways...  If made from veal, it's almost always
served with rice.  If from pork, then potatoes are also possible (fries,
or roast potatoes, or parsley potatoes) and less likely even noodles or
spaetzle.  (The pasta side dish I've run into more often in Germany.)

Title:  NATURSCHNITZEL
Keywords:  Schnitzel, Viennese, Austrian, Veal, Pork

12         3 1/2-oz cutlets from the top round of veal
           flour
           clarified butter for frying
1/2 cup    dry white wine for degreasing
1/3 cup    consomme
1/2 cup    brown veal stock
4 Tbsp     butter
           salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste

   1.  Pound the cutlets and make two incisions in the edge of
each to prevent shrinkage.

   2.  Dip one side of each cutlet in some flour and shake off
the excess.  Heat 1/4 cup clarified butter in a skillet and saute
several cutlets on the floured side until golden outside but
still pink inside, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn and fry 2 to 3
minutes more on the other side.  Add clarified butter as needed
for frying the rest of the cutlets.  Remove and keep warm on a
covered plate.

   3.  Degrease the skillet by adding the white wine.  Add the
consomme and reduce by half.  Add the veal stock and again reduce
by half.  Swirl in the butter.  Season with salt and pepper to
taste.  Pour any veal juices from the covered plate into the
sauce and heat through.

   4.  Place 2 cutlets on one side of each individual plate and
cover with sauce.

Serves 6.

CONTAINS RECIPE

     Dredging through my files also turned up this one, so I
figured why not. It does bring to mind the matter of salads.
One tends to run across "Gruener Salat" (green salad - which is
butterhead or Boston lettuce, or just possibly iceberg lettuce in
a vinaigrette dressing), and "Endiviensalat" (endive lettuce in
vinaigrette) or "Kartoffelsalat" (which may be in vinaigrette
with sliced onions, or with mayonnaise as below), or "Bohnensalat"
(bean salad in vinaigrette with usually onions), or "Fisolensalat"
(sliced cooked green beans in vinaigrette with onions - this one
improves by sitting a bit so the flavors can meld), or "Gemischter
Salat" (mixed salat, meaning several different types of salat -
e.g. from the above as well as others - arranged on a salad
plate. The mixed salat frequently includes a "Karottensalat" -
made from shredded carrots and a sweeter vinaigrette.)

     Overall, vinegar sometimes gets replaced with lemon juice for
leaf lettuce, and I think the lemon juice is standard for the
shredded carrot salad.

     Also, unrelated, the "Gluehwein" recipe somebody posted for you
earlier is a winter beverage, for indoors or outdoors.

     Now then, the potato salad - and then I shall get back to
trying to catch up with reading mail. I'm a good three weeks
behind...<sigh>  Let me know if you've any questions.

  Subj: *CR*Lean Leg of Lamb
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
1989 Grand Prize, The Times-Picayune recipe contest: Martha Post

LEAN LEG OF LAMB, ROASTED WITH 2 CRUSTS

1 leg of lamb, about 5 pounds

Crust 1:
4- 5 tbsps Kosher salt
2 fresh lemons, juiced 
pepper to taste

Crust 2:
1-1/3 cups fine bread crumbs, made in food processor from day-old French
     bread
6 tbsps melted butter
4 large garlic cloves, minced
1 green onion, minced
1/3 cup fresh parley, minced
1 tbsp fresh rosemary, minced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Allow lamb to come to room temperature. With a
small, sharp knife, remove all fat from lamb. This affects the taste of the
meat as well as the calorie count. Place lamb on a rack in roasting pan. Rub
all over with lemon juice and grind on fresh pepper to taste.

While lamb is still wet with lemon juice, cover top of meat with a
1/8-inch-thick layer of Kosher salt, taking care not to spill excess salt into
roasting pan. (Kosher salt is flaky, does not dissolve as readily as table
salt, and does not penetrate the meat. It will form a firm crust as the meat
cooks.) The salt crust takes the place of the natural layer of fat and keeps
the meat moist and juicy during roasting.
Pour about 3/4 cup water into bottom of roasting pan and place lamb in oven.
Roast lamb, uncovered, about 1-1/4 hours. After about 15-20 minutes, the juices
in the bottom of the roasting pan will begin to evaporate and brown. Add enough
water, about 1/2 cup, to bottom of pan to dissolve the browned particles and
prevent them from burning. Continue to add water to pan during roasting period.
Meanwhile, combine bread crumbs, butter, oil, garlic, parsley, green onion and
rosemary in small bowl and mix well to form second crust. After roasting period
is up, remove lamb from oven.
The salt will have formed a thick, firm crust on top of the meat. Carefully
remove the salt crust from meat - it should lift off easily in one piece.
Discard.
Spread bread crumb/herb mixture evenly over top of lamb. Replace in oven and
continue to roast for about 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour, or until temperature of meat
registers 135 to 140 degrees on an instant-read meat thermometer for medium
rare. Actual roasting time will depend on the temperature of the meat when
placed in oven - your oven temperature and thickness of meat. Cook longer if
desired, but medium-rare lamb is quite delicious! Remove from oven and let rest
for about 10 minutes before slicing.
While lamb is resting, you may make a quick sauce as follows: Pour a package of
French's Mushroom Gravy and mix into saucepan. Add 3/4 cup cold water to
roasting pan, stirring up all browned juices. Pour liquid into saucepan with
gravy mix. Stir well and simmer until thickened. Serve with lamb. Makes 8
servings.

1990 Runner-Up, The Times-Picayune recipe contest: Louis McNeal

SWORDFISH STEAKS WITH AVOCADO BUTTER

1 stick unsalted butter, softened (1/4 pound)
1 medium ripe avocado, peeled and pureed
2- 3 garlic cloves, finely minced
2 tbsps lime juice, freshly squeezed
salt, white pepper and Accent to taste
dash of Tabasco
4 (or 6) swordfish steaks
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
salt and white pepper to taste
a wisp of garlic and onion powder
unsalted butter

To prepare avocado butter, whip butter until creamy. Slowly add avocado,
garlic, lime juice, salt, pepper, Accent and Tabasco. Set aside.
Add other seasonings to flour and mix well. Dredge swordfish in seasoned flour;
shake to remove excess. Saute swordfish in butter 4-5 minutes, depending upon
thickness. Remove from heat; place on warm serving dish. Spoon avocado butter
over swordfish. Serves 4 to 6.

Don't you have the ones you've typed up and previously posted?  I think
I saved most if not all of them, converted to Meal-Master.  Here's what
I could find, if you can think of any titles I'll look for them.  I KNOW
I converted and imported a bunch before I started putting the source in
the ingredient section (where it can be searched for) but I can't think
of any titles and I really can't look through my whole 7000-recipe db
manually.  :(

      Title: Pumpkin Soup
 Categories: Try it, Native amer, Soup
      Yield: 4 servings

MMMMM-------------------SPIRIT OF THE HARVEST------------------------
     29 oz Canned pumpkin
      2 tb Oil
      3 tb Maple syrup; or honey
    1/2 ts Ground dried spicebush
           -berries or allspice
      4 c  Beef stock; or chicken
           Thinly sliced green onions
           Chopped hazelnuts
           Roasted pumpkin and sun
           -flower seeds, for garnish

  In early pumpkin soup recipes of the northeastern woodland
  indians, the pumpkin would have been baked whole in hot ashes.
  Peeled and chopped pumpkin would then have been thinned with
  broth from wildfowl or game.

  If using fresh pumpkin, preheat oven to 350 deg F. Place
  pumpkin in a baking dish and roast until easily pierced with a
  knife, about 1 hour.  Allow pumpkin to cool, slice off top and
  scoop out seeds. Clean pumpkin fibers from seeds and discard
  fibers. Toss seeds with oil and salt to taste. Spread out on a
  baking sheet and return to oven 15-20 minutes, until crisp and
  golden. Reserve for garnish and snacks.

  Scrape pumpkin flesh from shell and mash, or puree if a
  smoother mixture is desired.

  Place fresh or canned pumpkin in a large saucepan and season
  with salt, pepper, syrup and allspice or spicebush berries.
  Granually stir in enough broth to make soup thin or thick
  consistency, as desired. Simmer over medium heat about 5
  minutes, until hot. If desired, serve soup in small pumpkin or
  squash shells. Garnish with onions, hazelnuts, and pumpkin
  seeds.

  Subj: Choc Chip Pizza CR2
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
I wanted to make chocolate chip pizzas for two different occasions
recently.  They both worked out fine.  One was crisp (which was what I
wanted) and the other was much like a soft batch cookie (which worked
out fine since that person had just had nasal surgery and was
complaining that her teeth hurt).

MMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.01
 
      Title: Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Pizza (Soft)
 Categories: Cookie, Dessert
      Yield: 2 12" pizzas
 
      1 c  Butter-margarine; softened
    3/4 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Brown sugar
      8 oz Cream cheese; softened
      1 ts Vanilla
      2    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
     12 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
      1 c  Chopped walnuts (Optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 375. Lightly grease two 12 inch pizza pans.  Cream
  butter, sugars, cream cheese and vanilla in large bowl.  Add eggs,
  beat until light.
  
  Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl.  Add to creamed
  mixture; blend well.  Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts (if used)
  
  Divide dough in half, spread each half evenly into prepared pans.
  
  IMPORTANT - DO NOT SPREAD ALL THE WAY TO EDGES, THIS DOUGH DOES SPREAD
  Leave about a half inch space between edge of dough and rim of pizza
  pan.
  
  Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely in
  pans on wire racks.
  
  To serve: cut into slim wedges.
  
  Personal note:  When these were brown and ready to take out of the
  oven they had a soft consistency - much like that of a soft batch
  cookie.  I wanted a firmer cookie.  Put them both back in the oven,
  and turned the off.  Let sit for 1 hour hoping they then became more
  like a chocolate chip cookie.  They never crisped up, but remained
  soft.  Still tasted good.

      Title: Candy Shop Cookie Pizza (Crisp)
 Categories: Cookie, Dessert
      Yield: 1 12" pizza
 
  1 1/2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Butter; softened (10 tbls)
      1    Egg
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 c  Semi sweet chocolate morsels
           -divided

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Peanut butter

           -Butter fingers, Baby Ruth,
           -Nestles Crunch; Goobers
           -Alpine White
 
  Preheat oven to 375.  Lightly grease 12 inch pizza pan or 15x10x1 inch
  baking pan.
  
  In small bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.
  
  In large mixer bowl, beat butter, sugars until creamy.  Beat in egg
  and vanilla.  Gradually beat in flour mixture.  Stir 1 cup chocolate
  morsels.  Using buttered wax paper, spread in prepared pan.  Bake 20
  to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Leave in pizza pan.
  
  Immediately sprinkle remaining one cup morsels over crust.  Let stand
  five minutes or until morsels become soft and shiny.  Gently spread
  chocolate over crust.  Let set. (After cookie dough has cooled, pizza
  may have to refrigerated for 30 mins for chocolate to set)
  
  Optional Ingredients:  If wanted, when pizza cookie comes out of the
  oven sprinkle one cup morsels on hot crust; drop peanut butter by
  spoonfuls on morsels.  Let stand 5 minutes or until morsels become
  soft and shiny.. Gently spread chocolate and peanut butter evenly
  over crust.  Quickly sprinkle the pizza with chopped candy. (After
  cookie dough has cooled, pizza may have to be refrigerated for 30
  mins for topping to set.)

Hi Sarah!

I've tried lots of different ones.  This one is so far my favorite.
Kind of like the bakery type muffins.  It's all the flour and sugar I
guess.    -Pat

Well Dave and I finally got moved into our new house and have things somewhat
organized.  Of course, it took me 12 hours but I had the kitchen ready to use
the first night!  I have my priorities straight although Dave didn't agree. 
It's about time I shared a recipe or two with everyone.  

ITALIAN POT ROAST  (very easy and good)
3-1/2 Lb Boneless chuck roast
1 can tomato soup
1/2 c water
1 cup sliced onion
1 tsp. garlic powder
2 tsp. oregano
1 bag Bow-tie noodles

       Trim fat from meat.  Place in a 9x13 roasting pan.  Bake at 350 degrees
for one hour.  Combine remaining ingredients except noodles.  Add salt and
pepper to taste.  Cover and bake two more hours or until meat is tender.  While
baking, cook noodles according to package.  Remove meat to platter.  Add cooked
noodles to sauce and simmer for a few minutes.  Stir to heat through and serve.
     My mother also cooks this all day in the slow cooker and adds the noodles
before serving.  It turns out well this way also.

This is another good recipe.  It cooks slowly in the oven for 4 hours.  I tried
to make it in the slow cooker but the vegetables didn't cook through.  

Ranch Style Stew

1-1/2 to 2 lb Round Steak               2 Potatoes per person
2-3 carrots per person                  2 green peppers
3 stalks celery                         3-4 onions
2 cans tomato sauce                     2 cans cream of mushroom soup

Chop all vegetables to about one-inch pieces.  Cut up round steak to desired
size.  Mix together tomato sauce and soup.  Place meat and vegetables in oven
proof dutch oven or large casserole dish.  Pour sauce over meat/vegetable
mixture.  Stir to combine well.  Cover and bake in a  300 degree oven for four
hours.  Do not lift lid and do not stir.
Stir once just before serving.
This recipe can be stretched by adding more vegetables if desired.

4 cups flour                        2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp baking powder               2/3 cup shortening
1 cup plus 3 tbs hot water

with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually
stir in water, mixing well. Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls; roll each
on a floured surface into a 6 inch circle. Cook tortillas in an
ungreased skillet over medium heat about 2 minutes on each side or until
lightly browned. Pat tortillas lightly with spatula while browning the
second side if the puff during cooking. Serve hot. Yields 24 tortillas.

3 tb Baking Powder                 1 cup  Water
6 tb Cooking Oil or Soft Lard
Directions:
Mix the flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl, stirring well
with a wooden spoon. Add the shortening with the liquid and dry
ingredients. Stir thoroughly. When the dough becomes too heavy to be
easily stirred, knead it until smooth on a floured surface. The dough
may then be shaped into a flat round about 1 inch thick or wrapped
around a stick like a snake if it is to be cooked over an open fire.
Raisins may be mixed in and sugar sprinkled if desired. Preheat oven to
340 degrees. Prick the top of the bannock before baking for 20 minutes
or until golden brown.

     Procedure:

  Take  7  Pounds of good spruce & boil it well till the bark  peels off,
  then take the spruce out & put three Gallons of Molasses to the Liquor &
  and boil it again, scum it well as it boils, then take it out the kettle
  & put it into a cooler, boil the remained of the water sufficient for a
  Barrel  of thirty Gallons, if the kettle is not large enough to boil it
  together, when milkwarm in the Cooler put a pint of Yest into it and mix
  well.  Then put it into a Barrel and let it work for two or three days,
  keep filling it up as it works out. When done working, bung it up with a
  Tent  Peg  in the Barrel to give it vent every now and then. It may be
  used in up to two or three days after. If wanted to be bottled it should
  stand a fortnight in the Cask. It will keep a great while.

     Digest: Issue #733, 9/27/91

     Ingredients (for 6 gallons):

                  3.3 pounds Steel City Ale Kit
                  2.2 pounds John Bull plain light malt extract
                  1.1 pounds plain light dried malt extract
                  1/3 pound  crushed chocolate malt
                  1/4 pound  crushed crystal malt
                  6 ounces   fresh spring spruce sprigs (boil)
                  8 spruce   sprigs (finishing)
                  2 cups     culture of Munton & Fison Ale yeast

     Procedure:

 Place Crystal and chocolate malts in 1 gallon cold water and raise temp-
 erature  to 158 degrees and immediately strain into the brew kettle and
 sparge  with 2 cups of 158 degree water. Add malt extracts and water to
 bring volume to 6 gallons. Add boiling sprigs when boil begins and boil
 for  60 minutes. Add finishing sprigs and boil for 3 minutes. Chill via
 wort  chiller. Pitch yeast at 68 degrees. Single stage ferment in glass
 for 14 days then bottle using 1 cup corn sugar to prime.

     Comments:

 I didn't like this beer at first because I felt that a spruce essence
 was lacking in the flavour. However, two months in the bottle cured that
 problem  and  the  beer was exquisite and "sprucey"  and  improved with
 further aging.

     Specifics:

     Original Gravity: 1.046
     Primary Ferment: 14 days

      Title: Apricot Cupcakes

      Yield: 36 servings

      6    Eggs
      3 c  Fruit spread, apricot
    3/4 c  Applesauce
    3/4 c  Butter; softened
      2 tb Extract, vanilla
      3 c  Flour
      2 c  Oats
      1 tb Baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
  3 3/4 ts Pumpkin pie spice

  Preheat oven to 350.  Beat eggs in large bowl.  Blend
  in fruit spread, butter, applesauce, and vanilla.  Add
  flour, oats, baking powder, salt, and spices; mix
  well.  Pour into lined muffin tins.  Bake 18 minutes,
  until golden brown.

  For bars: Spread dough into greased 12"x8" baking
  dish.  Bake 18 minutes, until golden brown and firm to
  touch.  Cool completely on wire rack.  Cut into bars.
  Store in tightly covered container.

  Sylvia's comments:  The kids at Irene's school loved
  it -- Irene came home and asked me to make it again!
  I think it needs less fruit spread and less pumpkin
  pie spice, and next time I'll use applesauce for all
  the butter.
