The H.O.M.E. BBS uses a VFast modem that may have difficulty handshaking
with some V.34 modems. Send email to BEB@lilly.com and we'll find a way

   DOOR on the market! Have to see to believe. FidoNet "magic name" of

Buzz

   The original role-playing DOOR of drug abuse. Try to reach the ozone

   hair, jump out the window if you take too many hallucinogens. MUCH
   more! Ratings are assigned at the end of the game, includes an online
   "Hall of Burnouts."

   *DISCLAIMER* Buzz is for fun, and is not meant to condone the activities
   mentioned within it. Please place the door in a restricted area so
   children cannot access it.

   both netmail or echomail -- at the same time, if you want -- and can be
   used for gating mail in some applications. Notify yourself of uploads or
   post log files to yourself, rather than reading them from DOS. Can be run

   much more. FidoNet "magic name" of TICTAC. $5 registration.

FREAKOUT!
---------
   A program that's sure to throw a scare into your co-workers. When
   executed, FREAKOUT's sirens wail, a huge WARNING flashes, and a notice
   is displayed that their hard drive will be erased if they don't type a
   ridiculous key combination within 15 SECONDS. It appears to carry out
   this threat, but really does nothing and stops in a couple of minutes.
