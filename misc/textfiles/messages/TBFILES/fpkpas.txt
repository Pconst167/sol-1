Linux versions are in further developement. Current versions of DOS and
Linux versions are 0.6.6

It's there! You can get a copy at 
1) http://www.brain.uni-freiburg.de/~klaus/pascal/fpk-pas
2) ftp://mailserv.brain.uni-freiburg.de/gig2/pub/dos/fpk-pas

On the www page, there's also a link to a download site at
www.geocities.com, which may be faster for you.
