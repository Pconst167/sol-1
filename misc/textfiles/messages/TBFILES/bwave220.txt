                                ==============
                                 ANNOUNCEMENT
                                ==============

Cutting Edge Computing is proud to announce the release of The Blue Wave
Offline Mail Reader, v2.20!  The new version of the mail reader is available
for immediate download from the systems listed at the end of this message.
There are three different distribution files;  each one contains all of the
files necessary for a complete installation.

        * Blue Wave/OS2  -  For OS/2 v2.0 or higher.  This is a 32-bit
                            OS/2 text mode program.

        * Blue Wave/DOS  -  For any system running DOS or Windows.  This
                            is a 16-bit DOS overlayed program.

        * Blue Wave/386  -  For DOS systems with 2MB or more of memory,
                            and an 80386 or higher processor.  This is
                            a 32-bit Protected Mode program.

In order to keep this message a manageable length, we cannot list all of the
new features here.  There are over 200 new features and improvements to old
features including:

        * A context-sensitive online help system with 'hot-links' to
          related topics.

        * A new Preferences configuration system which allows you to
          configure the mail reader globally, for each individual BBS,
          and even for each message area on a BBS -- all driven by an
          easy-to-use pull-down menu system.

        * A new message filter system ('Twit' filters, as they are
          known to some) which is part of the Preferences system.
          Message filters can be defined globally, by individual BBS,
          or by message area.

        * An all new address book editor which supports 'Mailing Lists',
          and the 'adoption' of names directly into the address book.

        * An installation program which makes both upgrades and new
          installations painless;  you should be up and running in 5
          minutes or less!

These files will also be uploaded to America Online, but AOL is notorious
for taking "quite a few days" to post them for public download.
