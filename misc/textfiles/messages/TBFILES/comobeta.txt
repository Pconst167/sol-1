  Subj: {COMMO} with ZModem

Hi..

 DE> Thanks a lot for the tip that Commo is coming out with a version
 DE> with built-in Zmodem.  I will definitely get it, although I might
 DE> wait till it gets out of betatest.

Fred hasn't said anything regarding when he plans a "release" version
with internal ZModem.  I'm running 6.02 Beta "E" and it functions just
fine.  Fred's pretty good about debugging his program before he ever
lets anyone else take a look at it, unlike some other "Betas".

There are some other interesting enhancements in the Beta besides
ZModem, e.g,,
___--
Macro Files may be compiled to increase speed, to reduce size and to
improve security of source code.

A variable "sel_pns" has been added to the Setup File.  Set this to
"yes" if you have COMMOPNS.EXE in your "protodir" directory.  This will
cause COMMOPNS to be used for file selection instead of the SELECT macro

Any key code obtained with Alt-K in the Internal Editor can now be
configured with the "mky" item in the Setup File.  This allows any
built-in key label to be overridden.  More importantly, it allows
separate macro definitions for the extra keypad keys on the enhanced
keyboard.

Control characters below ASCII 28 can now appear in {COMMO}'s support
files and variable strings (the only exceptions are ASCII 0, 10 and 13
-- these may never appear as data).

The SEND function has a new switch "N" for turning off control character
conversion.  For example, {send-n abc|~} will send the actual string
"abc|~" and not convert the "|" or the "~".

GETString has a new switch "I" to allow input from the local terminal
only (characters from the remote will be buffered and characters entered
locally will not be sent to the remote).  This switch overrides the
current setting of Echo Status from SETGet.

The LOOKfor timeout timer will now be restarted whenever a string is
sent by SSLOok.  This will help prevent macros from aborting
prematurely.
___--
If you're interested in checking out the Beta, dial 602-290-2807
(V.32bis/24h), login as "Beta Test" with password "Guest".  This starts
an automatic ZModem transfer of the most current Beta with automatic
logoff at end of transfer.  Total on-line time is less than a minute at
14.4Kbps.  BTW, I'm the sysop of the system at that number.
