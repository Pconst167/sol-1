Fm: William F. Zachmann 72241,43
To: All

I can think of no better occasion than the Fourth of July to declare
independence from those who would dictate the content of what I write.  Over
the past several months, I have been repeatedly subject to what I feel to be
inappropriate and improper pressure from PC Week in regard to my views on
Microsoft and Windows, IBM and OS/2.

I had hoped that this was a temporary aberration that would soon be corrected.
Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.  I have therefore sent
notice to the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company that I do not intend to renew my
agreement with them when its current term expires at the end of September.

I believe that Mr. William Ziff, Jr. is genuinely committed to editorial
integrity and independence.  Unfortunately, I think Mr. Ziff is being
ill-served by some of his employees who do not share that commitment.  I am
concerned that the regretable tendency to shape editorial content to please a
major advertiser (Microsoft in this case) which I have noted in some competing
publications is being imported into the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company.

If you share my concern, you may want to write to Mr. William Ziff, Jr., Ziff
Davis Communications, One Park Avenue, New York, NY, 10016 and let him know
what you think. Please feel free to repost this messages elsewhere if you
wish.

Bruce,

I wrote it with great sadness.  My agreement with Ziff-Davis Publishing
Company covers my entire relation with them including PC Magazine.  I am not
at all happy about these events, but I do not feel I can continue to write for
them if I do not have a reliable assurance than I will be permitted to say
what I think ought to be said.  I have patiently sought such assurance for
weeks now with the only result being the emergence of more subtle ways to
muffle me, the latest being clear indications of an intention to, in effect,
design my column out of PC Week.

Were I simply to acquiesce to that, I would be setting a precedent of
compromising principles that I feel ought not to be compromised.  I have
therefore chosen, after much deliberation, to put my entire relation with Z-D
Publishing on the line at the sacrifice of substantial income to myself.

Will

Will,

Personally, I think you should have a one-on-one talk with Bill Ziff, Jr.

Given the fact that your columns attract many readers to PC Week and PC
Magazine, your resignation from Ziff-Davis will create a major hole in the
writing of these magazines.

Question is, who can replace you? Are there people here in this forum who can
step in and write good columns like you do?

Will Zachmann is a remarkably talented observer of the PC marketplace.  I have
enjoyed his writing for years, and his presence on PC-Magnet is what attracted
me to this forum.  If Will's editorial freedom has been improperly infringed
by editorial pressures, Z-D has made a grave error.

I think Ziff needs to act swiftly to put forward its own position.  Absent a
credible response to Will's statements, the value of the whole Z-D PC
publishing franchise will be damaged.

There is a fine line between the legitimate guidance excercised by an editor
over a columnnist and blatant interference in the writing of the column.  If
PC Week editors have crossed that line, they are at fault.  If Will is simply
resisting a change in subject matter, then he may not be entirely right.  By
going public with the dispute, Will has seriously escalated the conflict.
Whatever the outcome now, the damage will be considerable.  The failure to
contain this incident and reach an appropriate compromise reflects badly on
PC-Week editorial management.

I thought Joan Brewer already was a "special prosecutor."  She is to me,

The phone call from Microsoft to Zachmann is enough evidence for me to
indicate unacceptable influence.  For Will to get a call immediately after his
meeting with Sam, and for Microsoft to know the content of that meeting, well,
that is just inappropriate for a reputable publication.

If the editor of PC Week denies calling Microsoft and disclosing the
discussions he had with Will, then I will reexamine my views.  Please note, I
don't fault your employer at all.

Sorry, Bruce.. I am having a tough time thinking John Dodge would "bend over"
for Microsoft. Just doesn't fit. Too much real, shall we say, personalities,
involved. John, as I have said, is not one of my favorite press folk, but he
is just not the type to compromise his paper for an advertiser, esp. MS. Sam,
on the other hand, is also just flat not the type, sorry.. I will rag on Dodge
or PC-Week til the cows come home, but I would not want to debate either's Sam
or John's ethics as they are pretty high, in my opinion.. Both guys, in my
opinion, would resign rather than compromise their ethics.

All of the above is just my opinion. John, Sam, just take this too seriously
too be part of a kill Will cuz MS sez so plan..

This is what confuses me.. All the players (Will incl.) don't fit the plot..

Yes, I honestly think we need to look for some sort of misunderstanding; but
until Sam or the someone at Microsoft is able to explain why Will received
that phone call, I believe Will is justified in being public in demanding
answers.  He's just doing to Z-D what Z-D does to IBM or MS whenever given
half a chance--forcing accountability and demonstrating respect for "the
people's right to know."  A separate issue is "what will the people do?"

I'm somewhat concerned that the topic of MS advertising as a blunt instrument
and their policy towards other companies and aggressiveness in PR has still
received almost no serious press coverage.  MS SEEMS to operate in almost a
moral vacuity with impunity.

I won't put you on the spot, Rick, by asking about any of this--I have too
much respect for you personally...

At the risk of sounding a little simplistic, I expect vendors of all sizes to
put pressure on all types of organizations and people.  Even I get a fair
amount of "pressure" from a wide variety of vendors to purchase or endorse
products for my company.  This I expect.

However, that does not mean I will buy everything in sight just to please a
vendor.  The same goes for publications.  I expect advertisers to try to
influence and I also expect publication management to tell them fly a kite or
someting similar.

<...order the termination of any employee of Microsoft and/or Waggoner-Edstrom

Actually, what's so unusual about this?  I guess it comes down to the type of
influence that was attempted.  Microsoft's position with the press is
inherently unstable, and it would be difficult to apply pressure in any way
that wouldn't backfire.  For example, could MS effectively cancel ads in ZD
publications?  I can see the higher-ups at Borland and WordPerfect jumping up
and down at that thought.  MS would have to be _really_ stupid to do something
like this.

Or, could MS have inferred that they'd withhold vital pre-release info to ZD
publications?  Again, it would be like shooting themselves in the foot.  MS
has become masters at manipulating the press by providing very early beta of
products and by being "open" to select members of that press (Microsoft has
done this since at least 1983, when Pam Edstrom invited me up to MS for
meetings with everyone -- including Mr. G -- and I have to admit I've had a
generally favorable view of the company since).  To discard this effective
approach would be suicidal.

I'm not saying something strange didn't happen between MS and ZD, but I doubt
it was anything as simple as canceling advertising or making it tough for PCW
or PCM magazine to get their hands on pre-release MS products. That's far too
simplistic, and it doesn't make sense.

I think what has happened is that Mr. Zachmann feel wronged by PC Week because

I'm in favor of any industry self-examination.  It seems a little too wild and
woolly, with too little accountability and respect for ethics.  A free press
is necessary to enforce ethics through normative pressures--and when the press
is compromised, ethical accountability is no longer as effective.

Some examples that cause me personally to be concerned are that Z-D is jointly
sponsoring, with Microsoft, an initiative to make "Windows Compatibility" the
hardware standard, and that Z-D published for Microsoft a booklet of some kind
to accompany Windows 3.1.  Depending on how Z-D is compensated for these
partnerships, and depending on how Z-D employees share in the financial
well-being of Z-D as a whole, e.g. profit-sharing, there is at least the
potential for serious conflicts of interest...

Dave,

In the narrow sense, the key principle is that when someone who is not an
employee of a publication writes an opinion column, the opinions expressed
ought to be those of the writer, not those of the editors of the publication.

In a broader sense, the principle is that readers ought to be able to assume
that what they read in a publication generally represents the honest views and
assessments of those who write them rather than be dictated by other interests
behind the scenes.

In the broadest sense, the principle is of freedom of expression, not only in
the strictly legal definition thereof, but in what that principle is generally
understood to mean -- the right of people to say what they think.

Like the very famous french skit about the marquise who learns of complete
catastrophe at here home.  At each new one, she asks, "so, other than that, how
are things?", and the invariable answer is, "tout va bien madame la marquise,
sauf....":  the horse died, the house burned down, her son drowned, etc. etc.
Thus, there is the expression used 'tout va bien, madame la marquise!'.

No, not integrity.

This is nuts.   How the domination of the industry by any single company, be
it Microsoft, IBM or whoever else is out there trying helps us, escapes me.
Now, I don't blame any of them for trying, and perhaps we benefit to some
extent as a result of their trying, so long as no one succeeds in knocking out
all competition.

But those of us who have only 24 hours in a day which requires dedicating at
least twice that to stay in reasonable touch with what is happening and also
do our jobs, must rely on the press for a good deal of our information.

If editorial integrity is seriously compromised, our effectiveness is
seriously curtailed.  We positively, absolutely need healthy differences of
opinions in the press, as free of undue pressure by any of the big players as
is reasonably possible.  You play a crucial role in the industry and in
society at large.

Even forgetting advertising revenues and their potentially pernicious impact
on editorial policy, I can envision a scenario in which Sam Whitmore and the
PTB at Ziff might be overly influenced by Microsoft without being fully aware
of it.  It's gotta be really tough to maintain objectivity in an industry in
which we get so passionately involved with our tools. Golly gee, in what other
industry do we find people working for successful vendors whose titles are
Evangelist?

Ok, so perhaps complete objectivity is an impossible dream.  Independence,
however, is an essential goal for a serious publication.  And independence is
accomplished in part by allowing responsible columnists with differing points
of view relative freedom of expression.

As I said over on PCWeek, this is truly a sad turn of events.  At best it is
an unfortunate misunderstanding and we readers are deprived of your talents,
something which is bad enough.  At worst we are in real trouble. -Marilyn

There is much more to compromised influence and conflict of interest than
having Editorial and Advertising in the same reporting structure.  It all
boils down to this:

Are there avenues or loopholes whereby a PC Week employee can benefit
materially from the success or failure of any company if that employee is in a
position to contribute to that very success or failure?

If so, there is a very real potential for compromise, extortion, undue
influence, conflict of interest, or ethical trauma.

Some obvious examples: Employees leaving a magazine to work for an industry
vendor, stock ownership, bribes, kickbacks, boondoggles, freebies, envelopes
full of cash left on desks of those who write "well," joint ventures with
vendors, spouses or close relatives working for vendors, etc. It takes some
pretty aggressive steps to avoid such conflicts, or they will creep into any
organization all but unconciously...

I guess I'm thinking the unpopular.  We understand what has happened.  And I

exploits every line they can - it's their job.  However, I wouldn't think PCWk
would be classified as a "line to be exploited"!

That being said, there are as many questions now unanswered as before the

William,

As a long time reader of PC and PC Week, I must say it makes me wonder about
the objectivity of the Ziff publications after hearing your story. I have
always considered your articles as the devils advocate to balance out some of
the good natured overzealous attitude some of the other writers have. Without
your opinions gracing the pages, I would think both publications will be off
balance.

I certainly hope that you find a less restrictive forum for your insights. The
last thing we need is another publication with a case of Windows myopia. It
has its place (indeed, I am using it now), but comptetion is healthy, and a
truly unbiased publication would provide all of the available options to its
readers.

Question...Is there a Fax number we could use to voice our opinions to Mr.
Ziff? Would cancelling my subscriptions help?

Marc,

I don't offhand know what FAX number would be best to use.  I would, however,
urge you *NOT* to cancel your subscription to PC Magazine.  My problems have
been primarily with PC Week, not with PC Magazine.  It remains possible that
all this can be resolved happily.  I'm not terribly optimistic about that, but
I do not rule out that possibility, either.  That really is up to Z-D at this
point.

If they want to get retaliatory toward me for having gone public on this, then
we will all know what they are about.  My own view is that I have been
extremely patient, having endured over two months of this nonsense without a
satisfactory resolution.  To make it a public issue was an option to me back
in April.

I have done so now only because it became clear to me that I was not getting
anywhere with a behind the sceens approach. It also became increasingly clear
to me that Ziff-Davis Publishing Company Chairman and CEO Eric Hippeau was
part of the problem for me rather than part of the solution.

Only then did I decide to take the steps that I have taken.

Over the past 1.5 years or so, I've noticed quite a turnover in PC Week
columnists. I was surprised to see Cheryl Currid go to Infoworld and Carole
Patton's Windows column did not last long. While I know you can't speak for
those people, I wonder if you had some general knowledge as to whether other
columnists experienced the same kind of problems with Ziff that you are.

Todd,

It is a well-known fact that high turnover in an organization is a common
symptom of management problems.  Not only has the turnover of columnists at PC
Week been very high for the past year or two, but the turnover of editorial
employees appears to have been quite high as well.

If that is the case, I suggest that you resign ONLY from PC Week. Strike a new
deal where you only stay with PC Magazine, because let's face it, Michael J.
Miller, Bill Machrone, John C. Dvorak and Jim Seymour take as many shots at
Microsoft as you do in their regular columns <grin>. Have THEY been threatened

I've been repeatedly impressed by the public stance that PC Week takes in
separating its editorial and marketing groups.  Marketing cannot gain
admittance to Spencer's parties, for example (and they don't like it one
little bit).

However, both groups are ultimately managed at a single pyramid apex. It seems
that Will feels that the problem lies at that point.

Yes, I think it is awful that, apparently, a controversial columnist would
find pressure enough against his stance that he would feel forced to quit to
maintain his integrity.

But, all in all, I really don't put the loss of one trade journalist at the

own skeletons to keep in their respective closets.

Besides what makes you think that PCWeek is the only pub with, perhaps, undue
advertiser influence.

Try an experiment: you're a columnist for a ZD book now, right?  Try
mentioning this in your next col and see what happens.

They won't.  Nor at this point will Will have any chance at a shot of
hanging around either, even if Earle was incorrect and Will is not being
premature about this.  Remember what happened to us both at UNIX Today! ?
Remember what just happened to me over on BIX?  And so on.   Stories are all
different but OTOH they are all the same, just the names have changed.
This is no longer what happened or didn't happen, but now unfortunately
strictly what Will did because "they" (the only opinion that counts) say
that he did.

I hope I am all wrong in this case and that instead Will can leave when it
should be naturally or mutually time for him to leave.

Eric,

PC Week, in effect, required that I narrow my focus to Windows and related
issues last fall -- *not* to OS/2.  You recollection of what I said over on
IBMOS2 is incorrect.  It was made clear to me that unless I agreed to do that,
my column would have been dropped at the end of last year.  I agreed to do so
with the understanding that OS/2 was a related issue and that I could continue
to write about both (and Unix as well).

When I did so, however, I began to have problems.  On April 23 PC Week Editor
in Chief Sam Whitmore said I was "losing my credibility" because of my "lack
of objectivity" in what I was writing about Windows and OS/2.  He made it
clear that he did not want me to continue writing the sort of stuff I'd been
writing about Windows and OS/2.  He several times mentioned Carole Patton's
column and its fate with the clear implication (clear to me, at least) that my
column would suffer a similar fate if I did not shape up.

It was upon returning from that meeting with Sam that I received the phone
call from the individual at Microsoft who told me about how they'd recently
heard that I was going to be taking a more favorable view of Microsoft and of
Windows in my column.  In response to Sam's pressure, I wrote the May 4, 1992
column where I pointed out some problems and limitations with OS/2.  I had no
problem getting that column printed.

Two weeks later, I intentionally and deliberately wrote a column for the May
18, 1992 issue in which I discussed a very similar set of problems with
Windows 3.1.  I received a phone call from PC Week Editor Eric Lundquist
saying the column "didn't work" for him and asking me to write another on
another topic.  I had a lengthy discussion with him in which I refused to do
so and argued that my column should run as submitted.  He finally agreed to
mark it up with his problems/objections.  While a virtually idential column
about OS/2 had gone through without difficulty two weeks before, Eric was all

I can't believe this discussion of internal PC Week meetings is taking place
in a public forum.  You were quick to correct me when I suggested that you had
an employment relationship with PC Week -- fine, call it a client/contractor
relationship if you prefer, is that any excuse?

I have been a PC Week columnist for most of my three years with the paper,
first in the Software section and more recently on the Op-Ed page.  I have
written things that castigated every one of our major advertisers on at least
one occasion.  Editors have never tried to influence content.  They have made
many useful suggestions as to making columns more interesting to read.

Why am I reminded of the final scenes in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Lenny
Bruce when he gets up on stage and reads from the transcripts of his trials?
When the messenger starts to think of himself as the message, audiences are

I cannot believe that you can claim to be upset about my discussing what I

applied to a columnist and yet remain silent about the fact that such pressure
was applied.  That is the moral equivalent of telling a victim of family abuse
they ought to remain silent because to speak of it is disloyalty to the

relation between equals as defined by my agreement with Ziff-Davis.  Nothing
in that agreement requires that I suffer abuse silently.  Despite what I
consider to be undignified and shabby treatment I have patiently tried for
over *two months* to resolve this matter internally.  It was, in fact, an
insulting and imperious demand from Eric Hippeau that was the occasion for my
final decision not to renew my agreement and to break my silence on the
matter.

Congratulations to you if you have never been subject to such pressure.  I
was.  I have been, on and off, at least since I wrote the column about Bill
Gates memo last summer and it got worse as time went on.  Perhaps you've just
never written anything to offend the wrong people.

As to Sam Whitmore & Co., I would remind them of an old saying that has always
struck me as one that ought always to be kept in mind:  If you don't want
anybody to know about it, don't do it.

>>Your showing your colors and they seem to be yellow, I hope I'm wrong.<<

I am confused by a statement like that.  Peter makes statements that he hasn't
been the victim of pressure from ZD management and you convict him immediately
of parroting the party line.

One of the interesting things about this whole discussion is that those of us
not staff or contributors to PC Week are outsiders and it is difficult to know
what really happend.  Because of that I have no choice but to believe Peter,
Will and Sam.  Some of the stories contradict each other and who can tell what
the true story is?  If Will Z. is correct, then a serious breach of journalism
ethics has occurred.  However, my contact with PC Week staff has never given
any indication of vendor pressure.  If and when I have/see evidence to the
contrary then I will lean one way or the other.

Will says he got a call from a MS person willing to help him with his
re-education - we cannot say it didn't happen.  Same goes for Peter Coffee and
Sam Whitmore - do you have evidence that any of they are toeing the party line
regardless of the facts?

Peter, you point out the moral dilemma anyone faces who finally decides not to
compromise any more in the name of "loyalty."  Different people draw the lines
in different places--I faced some criticism for being disloyal when I spoke
out against the content of the memo summarizing Akers remarks last year also.
You chastize Will for going public with "discussions of internal PC Week
meetings," yet in effect, that is what is forcing Will into this position to
begin with!  I believe it is very much an excuse.  Will has a right to seek
redress in the public arena for private wrongs suffered.  If he's wrong, it'll
be HIS credibility to suffer...

Yes.  After I refused to back down and steadfastly defended what I wrote in it
(and pointed out that *all* the problems I'd mentioned in it had been
explicitly acknowledged by folks at Microsoft [I'd made sure of that before I
wrote the column since I expected that PC Week would not want to print it])
the column on Windows 3.1 problems *did* (after much contentious discussion
between Eric Lundquist and myself) appear in the May 18, 1992 issue of PC Week
as originally intended.

I agree about integrity, but not how will has gone about being so.  First, I
wonder why he didn't wait until his meeting with whitmore on july 13th.
Second, going over someone's head is a perilous procedure, and best done
privately rather than in public view.  Finally, since the problems concerned
pc week, arguably something less serious, at least in its editorial side
--technical seems more sound-- than pc magazine.

As I said, it has come down to two choices:  either whitmore is replaced,
'promoted' in ziff terms, or zachmann leaves.  Can management replace an
editor-in-chief because a columnist complains, demands his head?

From all I understand the ziff group is very private, very paternalistic too.
No interviews by bill ziff on 'the lifetime of the rich and famous' or
interviews in people magazine.  This kind of public airing of dirty laundry
will be particularly resented, in my opinion.

I still wonder why will didn't wait until after his meeting on july 13th, and
didn't try to reason with bill ziff directly.

All of this will titillate not a few people, will elicit many messages of
support.  How many of those people would be so suicidal if confronted with
similar problems?

The meeting was only briefly scheduled for July 2nd.  I initially told Sheryl

calendar and found I already had a conflicting appointment scheduled that day.
I phoned her back and, after a bit of back and forth, we confirmed the 13th.
All that took place early last week.  I did not cancel any meeting as you well

    It sounds to me like you've got a case of "severe personality conflicts"
going on here.  Maybe you should get a an arbtitrator or better yet take this
up with all parties in from of Mr. Ziff. I for one cannot fathom why you would
want your columnist to concentrate on Windows related issues, when there is a
crying need for SOMEBODY to write about OS/2.
     Don't be surprised if IBM comes stomping up to your door mad as hell.
I've heard rumors that they are not too amused at the idea of Microsoft
dictating editorial policy. Regrdless of the facts, this situation is rapidly
turning into a first class fiasco. If you don't settle this equitably, it will
have a very adverse impact on Ziff publications.

Disclaimer:  I do not know the contents of the contract Will has with Ziff.

That said, I would be very surprised if Ziff allowed any contract to be used
for an independent contractor other than one their legal beagles had written -
or at least red-penciled enough so that they might as well have done so from
scratch.

That being the case, I would hazard a guess that any mention of arbitration
contained therein is presented only from the view of Ziff and the use of same
will be solely at the discretion of Ziff.  All of ours read that way,
anyway....

Charles,

There is no language of any sort in my agreement with Ziff-Davis Publishing
Company with regard to the arbitration of disputes.  There is also no language
in the agreement that in any way requires that the agreement itself be kept
confidential.  Neither is there any wording that requires that any discussions
that I might have with Ziff-Davis personnel concerning the publication of my
columns be kept confidential.

The latter are matters between Ziff-Davis and myself, an outside party.  They
are not matters internal to Ziff-Davis. The agreement explicitly states that I
am *not* a Ziff-Davis employee.

Well, what you wrote implies that you wish to no longer write for any ziff
publication.  At least that is how I saw the following quote from one of your
messages:

"I wrote it with great sadness.  My agreement with Ziff-Davis Publishing
Company covers my entire relation with them including PC Magazine.  I am not at
all happy about these events, but I do not feel I can continue to write for
them if I do not have a reliable assurance than I will be permitted to say what
I think ought to be said.  I have patiently sought such assurance for weeks now
with the only result being the emergence of more subtle ways to muffle me, the
latest being clear indications of an intention to, in effect, design my column
out of PC Week.

Were I simply to acquiesce to that, I would be setting a precedent of
compromising principles that I feel ought not to be compromised.  I have
therefore chosen, after much deliberation, to put my entire relation with Z-D
Publishing on the line at the sacrifice of substantial income to myself."

Something about the public issues being debated here does not ring true.  No
one with any business sense takes matters such as this public unless they have
already decided that they want to resign and this is the best way to do a high
visibility exit on the basis of "integrity".

Advertisers *always* try to influence reviews and columns, this is not news.
If an editor slipped over the line in order to please advertising, it would
not be the first time - and the procedure to handle the situation is well
known.

Why is this a big deal?

It is a big deal because it points out potential ethical problems with the
industry as a whole.  In the two months I've been active on IBMOS2, EDITOR,
and PCWEEK, I've seen many of the discussions center around disagreements over
what constitutes fair and ethical behavior in this industry, bias in the
media, fair marketing, the importance of astute observers, etc. etc.  We have
seen discussions of a wide variety of business practices, with opinions
varying all over the map.  From my vantage point, I'd say this industry is
struggling right now with more than operating systems wars--it's struggling
with wars over ethics and principles.  This incident is one more manifestation
in that war....and we are all the poorer for not having agreement on the
issues or even on whether it is acceptable to openly disagree on the issues
and discuss them publicly...

Bruce, the one thing more important to me than anything else is the ability to
actually *trust* in what someone has said as being a factual representation of
their best beliefs.  Whether over a drink or through the pages of a magazine,
integrity of one's word is the only thing one has to go on.

I've destroyed at least one of my careers by deciding that my own integrity is
more important than a few dollars.

It is sad to have to now, if I believe Will (which I do based upon personal

publication as being tainted by the almighty advertising dollar.

But, I do agree with you: it is odd what strange bedfellows this kinda stuff

Ross, what planet did you wake up on this morning?  If it's this one, then you
*must* know that Ziff exists for one purpose and one purpose only:  To sell
advertising.  The fact that they must include a little editorial content to
cause us to by the magazine is a necessary evil.  Note that they have
successfully launched at least one other publication recently with almost *no*
editorial content (sorry, Mr. Beem) and they know they don't really need that
much in the other publications.

There is *no* commercial for-profit magazine that you can trust implicitly and
I know of no non-profit magazines - but I will entertain the concept that one
might exist. Maybe.

The fact that Will was pressured is unfortunate, but a fact of life.  Some
quit, others resist and stay.  The world goes on.....

Pressure by an advertiser to get the best placement in the mag I can
understand.  Buckling under to pressure to change the editorial content is
quite another thing.  Microsoft may as well just buy the magazine, or get some
bozo's like the ones that killed _OS/2 & Windows_ magazines focus to do it.
Nah, there's already a _Windows_ mag because of that - what would Ziff call it
then?

Understanding things as they are is not cynicism, it's facing reality. Those
who do not are doomed to tilt at windmills forever.

Look, please don't make the error others have of shooting the messenger, but
the editorial content of the publication is *not* very necessary for it to
sell.  See Computer Shopper and the like.  We simply feel that PC Mag and PW
Week are "different" and they are, in that their editorial content is
_greater_ than the other advertising vehicles - but not by all that much.

Was there not a thread about that here already?  I did not read it, but the

Editoral content isn't important in Computer Shopper?  Wrong! Clearly you
haven't been reading it.  Over a year ago, ZD decided to improve Shopper's
editoral content.  Something must have gone right, since as these changes were
implemented, Shopper's circulation has increased by leaps and bounds. Hardily
what you would expect if Shopper was just an advertizing vehicle.

I made the same observation about Shopper in another forum about six months
ago, and I had given up on the magazine about six months before that.  After
some Shopper editors and contributors jumped on my ass for what I said, I
bought a more recent copy, and found that -- indeed! -- it had improved. Now
I'm back to being a regular reader. However, if I'm any indication, I feel
that CS lost a lot of believers, and the comments from myself and Charles may
be typical of what happens when a publication goes down the wrong path (even
if it's only for a while <g>).  It's hard to regain trust in people who have
previously given up hope.

At any rate, I agree with Charles: magazines are advertising vehicles, pure
and simple.  I have yet to meet a publisher who decided to launch a magazine
because he/she was interested in publishing great editorial.  In my 14 years
at this, it's always been the lure of the advertising base.

_However_, if great editorial can come from said advertising vehicle, then so
much the better.  One does not necessarily guarantee the other.

I write for Shopper, and a host of other mags, Byte, PC Sources, PC/Computing,
etc. etc., and I'm surprised to say that I hear from more Shopper readers than
all the other magazines combined. I'm even more surprised to say that
Shopper's readers, or at least the ones who find me, actually read the

Ok, that's the second data point indicating that Shopper readers actually

Now for the bad part, as seen by the advertizers:  Reading the editorial

perhaps you are too successful?

Um, apparently the subscriber records are not available to anyone - I have
been a subscriber on and off (currently: on) for several years so I am aware
of the editorial content of the publicatuion.  To my mind it has not improved
particularly from the days Patch ran the thing - the *quantity* is up, agreed,
so that it's more of an irritant in finding the advertizement you want.

I still can not believe anyone reads the editorial content of the magazine
with any regularity.  The circulation has increased because the publication
provides the advertizements, period.  It would sell just as well with *no*
editorial (oh, maybe the price listings if that counts as editorial), IMHO.

We could settle the bet, of course, by CS putting out a normal looking issue
with no editorial to distract the shoppers and checking the newsstand sales.
But that's too logical.

Well, Charles, given the feedback I get from my little column and the other
articles that have run in Shopper under my byline in the last several months,
I'm inclined to believe that people do read the editorial copy.  I doubt the
Ziff management would be investing so much in writers for the magazine if it
wasn't making a difference.

I fail to understand the question, perhaps illustrating your point by
inadvertence.  But then, your statement illustrates that you did not
understand my point, kindly returning the favor.  Let me try again, simce my
shorthand was obviously not clear:

       A factor known to all can be discounted if warranted by whatever weight
the individual desires or feels appropriate, thus making the main point the
full and complete disclosure of the factor to all with a need to know.  You
know, the "efficient market" theory on which the stock market is supposed to
operate?

If you feel tilting at windmills is enjoyable, far be it for me to try to
dissuade you.  Personally, I try to attack problems that have a reasonable
chance at a positive solution.  The current one clearly does not.

Certainly - I subscribe to several of these artifacts usually because they are
refereed and one can _usually_ trust what one reads - but not always. Even
they can make an error in judgement, but it's always just that - no outside

Yes, I'm aware of the relationship between income and advertising.

However, in some books, such as Computer Reseller News, when a major
advertiser tried something similar to what we've heard about here, the editor
refused to buckle under and the advertiser was told to go advertise elsewhere.

There is a fragile trust between the public and the editorial creators of a
magazine that is easy to destroy.

And it's startling to see how quickly people are apparently willing to forget
the evidence of their own years of reading PC Week and accept one person's
claim that his editors' comments reflected cowardice rather than
craftsmanship.  The more you care about an issue, the easier it is to bristle
at someone else's efforts to help you make your message more effective and to
accuse that other party of ulterior motives.  The hardest thing, sometimes, is
to treat your own copy as raw material and to work with your editor in the
joint task of fitting the style of the paper and the needs of its target
reader.

Peter, my postings are also based upon personal experience in a variety of
trade publications, including some ZD ones.

Although I could see the possibility of Zachmann's editor giving him editorial
direction towards making the col more readable both in style or content (right
or wrong in their opinion, that is the editor's job), I can also see the
requirement by the publisher to the editor to tone down a very public and very
insistent columnist that attacks, on a regular basis, one of the book's major
advertisers.

There is a difference between writing an objective review and writing a
subjective column.

I see both possibilities (more readable versus more enjoyable to the
advertiser) as being possible.

I have been accused of being a cynic, but perhaps that's what's required in

There will always be advertisers--the only question is "Do you have an

Advertising money is due to circulation--you need readers to get it, and their
perception of your rag will influence their desire to read it.  So pleasing

This is all based on the assumption that any given contributor to any pub has
some soft of *entitlement* to say anything they please - regardless of
management's wishes.

John Dvorak could go start-raving-mad (had to pick an example, John.  No
offense...:) and started writing non stop about GeoWorks and bashing BOTH Win
and OS/2 for being resource hogs written in C.  Does he have a RIGHT to do
that.  Certinaly he has a right to try.  But the owners of the publication
 (seeing they kindda did invest the capital) should have the final say.

Whether that makes for the better magazine, the marketplace will tell.

Actually I would ask what planet you woke up on. Yes Ziff is in the business
of making money, thru adverts, subscriptions, .... Advertising does make up
the lions share. But to sell ads, you need readers, to get readers you have to
provide content that is of value to the reader. If the content is suspect you
lose readers, when you lose readers, you loose advertisers. When you talk of
PC Week which solely derives its revenues from ads it sells based on its
supposedly influential reader base it could be devastating.

Partiality will have a deleterious effect on other advertisers as well. If IBM
or Borland or Lotus beleives that partiality exists they ain't going to
continue to grace the pages with their ads.

Subscriptions (and newsstand sales) are only used to provide a base
circulation figure that can be audited.  Think of magazines that sell
subscriptions as controlled circulation types that qualify the reader on a
current economic basis instead of whatever purchasning influence he/she might
have.

 >But to sell ads, you need readers, to get readers you have to provide
 >content that is of value to the reader.

Verily, verily.  Of *course* content is needed to get readers.  I say the
content is the *advertizements* for more of the readers than you are willing
to admit.

 >When you talk of PC Week which solely derives its revenues from ads it sells
 >based on its supposedly influential reader base it could be devastating.

Within thirty days this will not be remembered by anyone not directly
involved.  PW Week will go on as it always has, infuriating some for the
apparently arbitrary subscription requirements and pleasing the vast majority
of those who even know about it by allowing them into the exclusive group that
receives the rag.  The sun will still rise and set as usual, and more
importantly the exact same advertisers will spend the exact same amount on PC
Week.

Some things never change, and one is that you truly can not fight a group that
does not believe there is a problem.....

I think you are the one that makes the mistake. We all chuckle about the lack

editorial staff colluded with a vendor, you can chuck it all. People

Now wait a flimflam minute, here. If you're implying that Corporate Computing
has "almost *no* editorial content," I object strenuously. Having lived
through the most difficult and expensive comparison test ever done, I can
vouch for the effort that went into not only the testing, but some fairly
negative comments about big vendors and advertisers. We've always had the
freedom to make those calls, and we always will.

One of the advantages of being big and successful is that no one advertiser
can hurt you by boycotting.

Ah, Ha!  Gigged a big one with that comment, it seems.  I wondered when I got
no comment at all from Mr. Beem, to whom it was intended as you will recall.

Perhaps we need to define "editorial content" as I use it:  By that I mean the
computer columnists writing regular by-lined columns in one traditional place
in the magazine with their picture at the head of the column - you know,
"editorial commentary and opinion about the important issues of the day"
stuff, not articles about the various press releases issued this last month
(and no, CC is not really bad about that so far) and especially not big
comparisons of products that are apparently simple compilations of spec
sheets.  While compiling spec sheets (and yes, I know how hard that is to do -
I've heard the PC Week gripe about the non-responsiveness of vendors) is of
value to many corporate users, by no stretch of the imagination is it
"informed editorial commentary" - and that's what I am looking for when I say
"editorial content".

And, since he as not responded (burned out by the message volume, I would
guess) I must admit that the first article by Mr. Beem was one of the two from
the magazine that I captured for immediate use - so I was a bit harsh on him.
The other was that neat article on travel agency robots (as a small sideline I
administer a travel agency - don't ask me how my conglomerate came to own it,
please) which had several errors in the data (appeared it was researched some
time ago, right?) about the companies but was still useful as a starting point
- which is more than I can say for any other mag.

I read your personal declaration of independence early this morning and
decided that the best response would be to go run.  So I did. Seventeen miles
in the mountains and in the heat gave me time to think about events.

Your action is not unexpected, Will.  You've been oh so careful in your public
comments regarding rumors of Microsoft's pressure on you via PC Week's
management.  General news articles in PC Week seem to have a Microsoft slant,
so it appears to me that you're not the only one in the midst of pressure and
conflict.

It appears to be easy for readers to fail to understand that you have
consistently not bashed Microsoft, nor have you promoted IBM.  You've
evaluated present facts (not to be confused with future facts <g>) and made
some well-reasoned assessments of the impact of those facts on future events.
You've been consistent and fair.  You've taken heat because your assessments
are not what Microsoft wants to hear.

Sam Whitmore's public response to you appears to me to be seizing an
opportunity to watch a problem go away.  It seems to me that a publication
purporting to report on an industry needs to be absolutely unintimidated by
individual companies.  It seems like there's a parallel with Caesar's wife
here somewhere.

The whole affair is obviously disturbing to a large segment of participants
here.  Everyone, including me, respects your refusal to compromise your
integrity (I know something about how painful that can be).  No matter what
happens at PC Week, I hope that your columns in PC Magazine can continue
beyond the end of September, and that your presence here will continue
uninterrupted.

Not everyone.  Some think it would have been more effective in the long run to
continue the fight internally.  To make the problem public as he has donw will
solve nothing, as Ziff can not be seen to respond to the desires of a
disaffected employee.  To do so would invite others to attempt the same
pressure play, not something any prudent management invites.

Most of the time and on average, dealing with "management" issues in a public
forum is not as effective as privately because both sides get stuck in a peace
with honor, face saving thing.. This is the unfortunate side effect. It takes
much more effort to tone it down, relax, and chat, when it is public..

Rick,

Had I thought there remained even the slightest chance of a quiet, private,
behind the scenes, satisfactory resolution of this matter I would not have
made a public issue of it.  The matter came to a head two months ago on April
23 and had been going on for months before that (even before I'd been required
to shift the focus of my PC Week column to "Windows and its competitors" last
fall).

Until the April 23 incident, I didn't even protest matters directly in
private.  I kept trying to accomodate in a manner that was consistent with my
own sense of integrity.  It was only after the April 23 incident that I began
to resist efforts to dictate what I wrote about and how I wrote it.  Only
after two months of repeated aggravation and clear indications that matters
weren't going to get any better (and likely worse) did I take the steps that I
did.

Will (and all)

For the record, there is no doubt in my mind that you truly feel ZD is not
playing nice. No doubt and I am not questioning your feelings in the least.

There is also no doubt that MS complains when they feel things are not fair
(right or wrong).  I was up here complaining about some of your columns and
some of PC-Weeks treatment of my company.  You held your ground well, we went
back and forth, and generally we agree to disagree on many things. Up to this
point, no issue, game being played about the way one would expect.

Then it gets weird. In my years doing this stuff, I have seen/
watched/encountered many folks at ZD. I *only* make the observation that, in
my opinion, those that I know appear to have the ethics that would make
crumbling before an advertiser just not possible. Joel Shore of CRN, Gary
Beach of Computerworld, Sam/John of ZD.. These people all seem, in my opinion
to try very hard to play it straight and keep some sense of balance and
standards in place. I only observe, Will, that I can clearly see any major
advertiser going to any publication and expecting to pressure but in many
cases, there are people with high ethics/standards that prevent the
complaining from turning into influence.

I think John Dodge slimed me in Katt. That was not Pro-MS and some will say I
deserved it. I think the guy is a crumb for doing it. A crumb for calling
Microsoft to complain about me talking bad about PC-Week.  I also think he
would resign in a second if he was feeling pressured to do something that
wasn't playing straight. His tatics are typical PC-Week trash BUT he is a man
with ethics and I doubt he would stand for influence peddling.. Rick

Public negotiating works in sports. I suppose its possible in computer
publishing. There are about a million or two readers of those two ZD
magazines, so I guess it could be possible here. Precedents have to be

Please disregard previous message - it was written before I read one from Will
advising that he was not and had never been an employee of Ziff.  My apology
for jumping to the conclusion that he was/had been an employee.

So, why do not you apply that enlightened policy you mentioned in your message
to your contract workers?  While they have no employment rights under law, one
would think that if only for the sake of appearance you would apply the policy
across the board, no?

I understand what you are saying and believe your facts as stated.

Nevertheless, your column appears in PC Mag and PW Week in such a manner as to
suggest that you are an employee.  Take a poll - I bet you will be surprised
at the non-Ziffnet readers who think you are a Ziff employee.

Will,

It is sad that Ziff Davis should allow this to happen.  I have noted what I
believe to be just the bias you point out.  Unfortunally in the long run such
bias will only serve to harm the very industry that both PC Week and Microsoft
depend upon for their very existance.  By fostering the notion that small
systems can not be dependable, the entire industry is hurt.  It is especially
sad to see Microsoft resort to dirty tricks (not just toward you but toward
the entire industry) for a short term profit.  Its time for Mr. Gates to put
somthing back into the industry.

I suppose Ziff Davis must also try to make a proffit, but, I suspect that any
short term profit they derive by allowing one advertiser to set policy will be
shorter than even they imagine.  After all, you don't see CP/M week any more
most if not all the Apple II publications are gone.  Maybe they should rename
it Microsoft Week.

In any event, good luck - ain't it a b*tch being right?  Keep us posted where
we can read your articals. Cheers, Frank

Dear Will and All Others Lurking...


I was truly sad to hear about your decision not to renew your relationship
with Z-D. Further, I was quite ticked off by the way the Z-D mamnagement at PC
Week treated you, as per your recent threads on this topic.

One of the important "draws" about this country is its history of press
freedom, which bases itself on Editorial Freedom. The Peter Zenger case, from
pre-revolutionary days (I believe) has been marked as the inception of this
particular freedom. I am repulsed and enraged that sanctum sactorum of
Editorial Opinion has been chipped away in a periodical that prints for an
industry that is on the verge of setting another precedent in our freedoms and
rights! I may not be wealthy or influential or gifted in political ways, but I
have enough intelligence to realize when something smells foul. If all you say
is true (and I feel confident in assuming your truthfulness), then I can only
say that Z-D takes its own financial well-being in its own hands when it
insults the intelligence of its readers. How dare they tinker with the
independence of thought that is supposed to occur within the Editorial Staff!
Even worse, how dare they do so without confessing to it publically!? If Z-D
wants PC Week to be solely Microsoft-riented, then they should have publically
said so, and given Will said notice and an option to stop writing for PC Week.
However, that didn't happen. As such, I, a user and a MIS for my department,
will wait to see what Z-D does. If I am not satisfied, then EVERY SINGLE
PERSON I ENCOUNTER WHO WANTS TO HEAR WILL KNOW OF MY DISPLEASURE AND OF MY
RECOMMENDATION TO IGNORE PC WEEK, free subscription or not!

In a time when our civil liberties are slashed and cut at every corner, when
our politicians care not to truly listen to our pleas and when the wealthy
seem to dominate our way of life, I think it is time to remind those willful

It is both customary and reasonable for the burden of proof to fall on the

By this principle I accept Will's statements until refuted by reasonable

I'm not a lawyer either but since this feels more like a civil rather then a

standard of "preponderance of the evidence," I offer for your inspection the
hundreds of pages of PC Week.  Remember the flack we took when we reported on
incompatibilities between Win 3.0 and Win 3.1? Remember Paul Sherer's cover
story that appeared on the show-floor issue at the first Atlanta Windows
World, with a headline to the effect of "Corporate Users Fed Up With Windows

Since the time and date are well know and the dispute is over a phone call,
Since you folks probably have a phone system with logging billing I am SURE
that if such a loging tape exists the existance or non-existance of such a
call to MS in a two hour period could be verified. Hey this is one of the
things computers are GOOD FOR. I certainly have written one of two phone log
extraction programs in the past (one in COBOL) so I know what can be done.

 >the best question asked so far in these threads has bee "Why would one

If you have frequented both the OS/2 and Windows sections on Usenet you
would realize that Will Z's steadfast belief in OS/2 has pretty much cast
him in the role of 'great satan' in the eyes of quite a few Microsoft
employees. Of course when he is gone another 'great satan' will arise,
possibly not so great but large enough to be the lightening rod.

earl's observation that for awhile now MS's people have been acting like a
cult is not with out truth to it.

No offense, but, Will is about the only columinst at PC Week or PC Magazine
pointing out effectivly OS/2's strengths and calling for a real protected mode
OS.  He was the only one really doing MS any damage.  Quite frankly when I
read either publication I really get the feeling you guys are afraid of
stepping on Bill Gates' toes.  Yea, windows may have weakness's but its the

make it better, not should it be replaced.

Let me quote from Page 265 of the July 92 PC Week from the column on memory
managers.  "The ultimate answer (if you ignore the possibility of building
DPMI support into DOS and letting applications developers use DOS extenders to
tap into extended memory, something that is a stong possibility in future
versions of DOS, is to move to an operating system such as OS/2 or an
operating environment such as Windows that runs in protected mode, enabling
programs to access directly the vast resources of extended memory on 286, 386,
and 486 PC's.  The downside, of couse, is that application programs must be
rewritten to take advantage of these environments. Unless we're willing to
give up our favorite DOS applications as we know them, we're likely to be
wrestling with the problem of limited memory for some time to come."

(Yes - it never closed the paren).  Obviously who ever wrote that (Rick Ayre
and Laura Cox) nor their editor has any concept of what OS/2 can do or is
willing to parrot the MS line.  In either case what was published just doesn't
give all the facts (neither are they presented in side bars).

In other words Peter, Will was the guy doing MS the most damage. Also remenber
- it is DOS and these days Windows sales that are MS's cash cows. They supply
the money to develope other products.  Boosting OS/2 over DOS really has the
potential to hurt MS.

>>>Boosting OS/2...has the potential to hurt MS.

Bill Gates has asserted, many times, that Microsoft makes more money per copy
sold of OS/2 than of Windows.  The battle is over who will define the
industry's direction.  I have noted, despite my preference for OS/2 as an
operating platform, that the Windows API is unassailable for perhaps the next
decade or so as the target toward which mass-market applications will be
written -- whether running on top of DOS, OS/2, or NT.  So let's not drag in
questions of who was hurting whom -- they might not turn out to support the
prevailing wisdom, and then we'd have to go back to being reasonable.

Maybe only in the short term, (I doubt that though) but not in the long range.
That's one of the reasons he is doing (or is permiting to be done) all that he
can do to stop OS/2.

Indeed I am holding the parties to different standards.

This is possible because the situation is not symetric.

The party who if they were to lie would benefit must prove the truth, the
party who would not benefit is presumed to be telling the truth.

Evidence of course can change this such as  if you can show a way that Will
would benefit by saying that PC-WEEK had tried to censor him when indeed it
had not.

Simple I would think.

It's the only issue that I've been concerned about of late. It's a simple
question, really:

Do you _know_ (ie: can you prove) that Will is right? If you don't know, why
do you automatically take his word for it? Do you _know_ that any collusion
took place? Will himself doesn't have any proof that collusion took place,
though he certainly suspects it..

Never said I knew all of the facts. However, I did say in my little soapbox
liturgy that I had taken Will at his word. But, regardless of what motivated
the managament at PC Week to pressure Will, they were out of line. Editorial
and management should _talk_ to one another, advising each of what is going
on, and if necessary, oreoare each other for flak, if it occurs. However, it
is the implied duty of any publication's Editorial Board to write their
opinion independently. Any effort to skew those opinions, contradicts the very
basis of American editorial journalism; it fetters the press and gives it the
image of a puppet, speaking the part written for it by others (whether
internal or external). The mere fact that Will felt pressured is enough to
question the Z-D management tactics at PC Week. Will writes an opinion column.
He has remarked on more than one occasion of his problems over the last two
months regarding his column, and several threads have occured here and in
other fora regarding said issue. By these comments I can only conclude that
something(s) certain people at PC Week have done are making Will feel that
what he writes is anathema to the management. As such, this constitutes an
undue influence. The defining measure is how Will feels; he has remarked that
after over two months of trying to deal with this, he finally couldn't take it
anymore. It is his perception of what the management is doing.

Perhaps the management isn't aware of what they were doing to Will. Certainly
the fact that the readership weren't aware all along that there were problems
between Will and the PC Week management could lend that point of view
credence. Right now, none of us knows what is the management's point of view
on this issue. That is why I am waiting to hear. If they explain themselves
sufficiently, or reconcile with Will, then I will be glad to see that the
American tradition of independent journalism has withstood another

     It is entirely possible that the pressure from Microsoft is not direct.
Suppose, for example, that MS employees complaint to the advertising
department how "unfairly" Will was treating them. They get an earlful, and
pass along their complaints to either the editorial department or their higher
ups in advertising.
     Not wishing to affects its advertising revenue, Mr Ziff says "ok, maybe
we'll get Will to tone it down a little to jeep everyone happy".  Will, OTOH<
feels this is pressure and totally unacceptable.  Sam is caught between a rock
and a hard place, and wants to carry out his superior's wishes.  The net
result: KABOOM!

Tony: don't get trade journalism confused with real journalism.

There are more than a few publications which are lacking in the editorial
integrity your would expect normally in a non-trade book: look at Microsoft
Systems Journal, for example -- you know it comes from Microsoft, but don't
you expect *everything* in there to be factual.  Would you find it unusual if
something false were published therein?  The publisher, Microsoft, has only
one interest in *everything* they print and that it to promote their own
product.

A book I used to work for has a publisher who tried to kill an unfavorable
review I wrote of a potential advertisor's product.  He did not succeed in
killing that review, but I do note that he is still there, I am not, the book
is making gobs of money, and their reviews follow many of the other trade
press which state "don't say anything nasty about an advertisor's products".

When the publisher makes editorial decisions, they will forever be towards
whatever the publisher can get away with to help the advertisors spend more
money.

The fact that Will went public with his problem in the only thing unusual in
this instance:  like sausages and laws, the creation of a magazine is
something which should never be witnessed by those with a faint stomach.

That's what I'm asking the editors of PC Week.  Is Will's allegation true and
has the integrity of PC Week been compromised?  Or, is Will lying? The silence
since Sam's initial response does not bode well for the weekly I have held in

Some might say it's none of my business whether the allegation is true.  I'd
respond by saying I base decisions and recommendations on what PC Week prints.
The integrity and independence of PC Week is vital to me. Stonewalling the

advantage--we all tend to, right?), then I will be upset, justifiably so, just

On the other hand, other than Sam's brief note here, we've not heard the other
side of it. I'd personally like to wait until we do.

Oh, for what it's worth, I've been at two Ziff pubs in the last 4.5 years (PC

change something to accomodate an advertiser. Not to say that it can't, just

Thank you for your response.

Am I to assume the timing of the phone call from Microsoft to Will was just a
coincidence?  I also find it curious that the phone call seemed to indicate
knowledge of your meeting with Will.

I readily admit I did not witness the phone call and I am relying on Will's
word.  The reason I'm convinced Will's recollection is accurate is that his
story is identical to what he privately told a small group in San Jose a
couple months ago. At that dinner, he expressed a strong desire to resolve
this matter in a way that was acceptable to both him and PC Week. He had no
reason to distort the facts.

Possibly speaking for many of us on this forum, I hope you and Will keep your
scheduled meeting next week.  Maybe you and Will can laugh at all of us who
are so concerned and worked up over this situation.

Just what was it about Will's columns that PC Week didn't like?  From what
I've read here so far that issue has not yet been addressed by PC Week and it
seems rather pertinent to those of us that are trying to look at this
objectively.

Ben, Dale and my husband Kent are about the same size.  When he and Lysa came
over for dinner, she thought she'd been trapped in a Tall People's Convention.
We were nice and tried not to scare her.

If we are going to talk of historical editorial freedom, then let's be
precise.  The individuals you enshrine *owned* the press they were publishing,
and that's always been the basis of the freedom you speak so glibly about:
Mr. Ziff has the absolute right (subject to adverse libel claims) to editorial
freedom, but his employees do *not*!  They have always been and continue to be
subject to whatever *he* thinks is appropriate and legal to print.  You may
not like it, but the owner of the press has absolute power to decide what is
published......

Gee, Charles, I'm sure it's attitudes like yours that have made America great.
You argue that owners of publications have every right to censor those who
write in them, that all magazines should routinely be expected to have their
editorial content influenced by advertisers, and that we all ought to take
that for granted.  Tell me, do you fly a black flag on the Fourth of July?

You are shooting the messenger again - poor form in any forum.

You have been in the business long enough to know that the owner of the press
is the one with the financial responsibility for what is printed.  The owner
indeed has the "freedom" to print whatever he can afford to and not the
employees or independent contractors working for the publication.  Argue with
the publisher about the content and one indeed will soon find oneself looking
for other suitable employment.  TANSTAAFL, fortunately.

This is Business 101, not some dark secret never before exposed.  Your tactic
of taking the matter public before it was resolved at the highest levels
indicates you had decided to leave anyway and are simply twitting Ziff at this
point.  Nothing wrong with that as it's your life and your decision - just
made the scroll rate here jump a bit <g>.

You wrote a fine column, and I am sorry you made the decision to leave without
carrying the battle you perceived to be required all the way through to
completion.  Had you done so, I have a feeling you would have been surprised
at the outcome - but since I am not involved and you have decided to not renew
your agreement we will never know......

He's right, Will.  "Freedom of the Press" is only freedom from the government
imposing their wish on what gets printed.

I do expect that all of the trade books will be influenced by their major
advertisers: else, we'd be seeing lots of articles extolling the virtures of
UNIX and other operating systems in these books instead of the
WinAppOfTheMonthClub we're seeing....

While I don't like it any more than you do, what Charles says is true: freedom
of the press belongs to the person who owns the printing press. There are some
publishers who will hold editorial independence higher than others, and will
not buckle to influence by advertisers.  And there will be some who act merely
as agents of advertisers, and print what is in effect advertorials -- but
without the disclaimer.

I assume you will be starting your own newsletter (if you already have one
please forgive my ignorance).  With your own publication, you'll own that
printing press, and you'll be free to say anything.  This is exactly what I do
now, and I find the freedom exhilarating.  The cost: it's exhausting work.

Will-

I didn't note any reference by Charles to influence "by advertisers".  I agree
with him that the owner of the rag is the final authority as to what goes into
it; that's free enterprise.  I leave it to the market to sort out the truth
from the pandering to advertisers--with free speech, the difference shouldn't
stay hidden for long.  Which is why I support you for making this public when
it couldn't be worked out.
