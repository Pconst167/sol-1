Fm: William F. Zachmann 72241,43
To: All

I can think of no better occasion than the Fourth of July to declare
independence from those who would dictate the content of what I write.  Over
the past several months, I have been repeatedly subject to what I feel to be
inappropriate and improper pressure from PC Week in regard to my views on
Microsoft and Windows, IBM and OS/2.

I had hoped that this was a temporary aberration that would soon be corrected.
Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.  I have therefore sent
notice to the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company that I do not intend to renew my
agreement with them when its current term expires at the end of September.

I believe that Mr. William Ziff, Jr. is genuinely committed to editorial
integrity and independence.  Unfortunately, I think Mr. Ziff is being
ill-served by some of his employees who do not share that commitment.  I am
concerned that the regretable tendency to shape editorial content to please a
major advertiser (Microsoft in this case) which I have noted in some competing
publications is being imported into the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company.

If you share my concern, you may want to write to Mr. William Ziff, Jr., Ziff
Davis Communications, One Park Avenue, New York, NY, 10016 and let him know
what you think. Please feel free to repost this messages elsewhere if you
wish.

Eric,

Personally, I think I would like to hear what Microsoft managers have to say
about this.

I want both Brad Silverberg and Steve Ballmer (both of whom are well-known CIS
users even if they spend most of the time "lurking") to clarify just WHAT did
happen between Microsoft and Ziff-Davis that resulted in Will Zachmann turning
in his resignation.

I don't see how they could say anything objective if it's true, and if it is
not, then Will would not have hung up his hat.

Personally, I believe Will Z 1,000%.  He backed his decision with his job!

Microsoft is only acting rationally.  If it can influence PC Week or other
publications, it will.  The fault doesn't lie with Microsoft, but with the
individuals at PC Week who would allow its editorial integrity to be
questioned.

I doubt it takes any action by MS to generate such behaviour at PC Week. Hope

One thing I can say about PC Magazine--they have balanced out their coverage
of Windows and OS/2 2.0 nicely, especially in the last few issues.

I myself think that PC Magazine Editor-in-Chief Michael J. Miller does a very
good job at giving a free reign to all PC Mag writers and columnists; after
all, John C. Dvorak has done his share of potshots at MS, too <grin>.

I'm not so sure of Michael J. Miller's being part of the problem. He is and
has said that he prefers Windows however it seems to me that his magazine
(different from the articles he writes himself) is NOT forced to any view.

It is true that if your boss has a view many will follow but I don't think
anything more then that is at work there.

You've got to be kidding?!?!?!?

PC Week has LONG articles on NT that are just rehashes of OLD press releases -
not new news, and some minor OS/2 coverage. Headlines ALWAYS skew for MS. PC
Magazine does the same.

PC XXX coverage of OS/2 is worse than PC Week's coverage of Apple.

Raymond,

This hardly makes them "balanced".  I've written numerous letters to them
regarding their blatant bias.  When an "unsuspecting user" writes to the
Windows Advisor column and asks "what is OS/2, and should I get it?", and the
reply from the "so called ADVISOR", doesn't mention multi-tasking, or WPS
"drag and drop" (and a truckload of other things that I have long since
forgotten), and basically says "they're the same thing, stay with Windoze", I
HARDLY think that's balance.  AND, of course to be balanced, they printed all
those letters that were written to challenge Fran's TOTALLY BIASED viewpoint
(and if you believe that last sentence, I have some nice property in Florida
that I'd like to sell to you....it only LOOKS like a swamp).

All the ZDC pubs are sucking up to M$.  It's YELLOW JOURNALISM of the absolute
worst kind.  If this were the dark ages, ZDC would be the "keeper of the
faith", and they'd be advocating the burning of OS/2 users by the thousands.

Where are you comming from? Who knows where in MS the pressure us comming from
or how many people it goes through? This has been a public issue for a few
months now, and if MS wanted to retain ANY credability here they should have
acted before now. ANY statement by MS now would be proof of a self-serving
attitude. Who here would even listen to Steve Balmer any more anyway?

How can anyone trust ZD, ZD Labs, or any write-up about MS? (And not just from
this. This is just one raindrop in a big storm.)

If ZD bows to M$ pressure on their writings about Windoze and OS/2, what does
that mean about all those EVALUATIONS they do??  If Gateway 2000 gets a few
good PC picks, is it because they make a good PC, or because they spend a
fortune on those Ads in PC Mag??  Does HP PAY for some of those LaserJet picks
that the "evalutaters" make??  Whose to know??  Once someone submits to
prostitution of any kind, then ALL their activities become suspect.

Yes, I'll be writing to Ziff, PC Mag (UK) was launched recently I had hoped
their attitude would be different. They Win 3.1 vs. OS/2 2.0 comparison they
published this month shot down any hopes of that. Mind you they published John
C. Dvorak's column on the back page :

        'Personally, I've chosen OS/2 because it runs DOS programs quite fast
and all at once. I know that you guys in England can hardly find a copy (IBM
UK only had 2000 copies at 1 Apr - Mike). If you can, buy it!
But not unless you have a fast 386/486 and 16 megs!'

it concludes with a nice comment from a Lotus employee. Is there any chance
this story can get a wider audience than us CISers ? Quite apart from our
feelings about M$, the idea that a large corporation can interfer with the
free press in this way is worrying.

Will- FYI this letter went in the mail today. Will you be writing for some of
the OS/2 publications? Let us know which ones so I can signup for
subscriptions, as you and Dvorak are the only people I believe anymore. I
applaud your integrity and honesty.

Dear Mr. Ziff;

  I recently read a message on Compuserve by William Zachmann, regarding
pressure by your executives to slant editorial coverage in your publications
in favor of a major advertiser (Microsoft). I was aware of the obvious bias
with most of your editorial staff, but Zachmann's comments confirm my
suspicions.

  I have been a subscriber to PC Magazine and PC Week for many years. I read
these publications to get unbiased opinions regarding the latest in PC
technology. I do not need misinformation and propaganda from a major
advertiser, in this case Microsoft.

Were you aware of this conspiracy between your publications and Microsoft
against IBM? How could you have allowed this to happen?

I am as of today cancelling all my Ziff Communications subscriptions, and will
advise others to do likewise. If I want to be force fed the Microsoft party
line I would just turn to the MS ads.


Sincerely yours,





Scott W. Mack, M.D.

I've had it with M$ trying to monopolize the PC world (isn't that why the FTC

to Z-D caving in to M$'s whims....( and Will's resignation) !!!

Congradulations! on taking your stand on this particular day. Sort of sends a
double message. Like many others I believe that Ziff publications PC Mag in
particular has been bent in a direction that does not serve the readership to
it's former potential. I may or may not as time permits follow your suggestion
to write to Mr. Ziff, but no matter if I do or do not, I will not be renewing
my subscription. Letters are good but I believe the pocketbook will bring
change about more quickly. Of course I know that I am only one and it will be
like p---ing in the wind, but I will feel much better not supporting the
current policies!

Well, Ziff-Davis & PC-Week have gone from a credibility rating of about 2 (on
a scale of ten) right down to zero.  My congratulations to yourself for having
the fortitude to stand up for what you believe in.  A suggestion: what this
industry needs right now is a magazine that _objectively_ reports on real
issues and products.  Byte used to be such a publication, but recently they
seem to be jumping on the Windows bandwagon too (probably for the same reasons
as writers at Ziff-Davis).  I honestly can't think of any really objective
magazine except for Dr Jobbs Journal, but that's for programmers, not users.
Have you considered the possibility of starting a new magazine?  I think there
would be a huge market if you really pushed the objectivity idea - after all,
people have to get there info somewhere, and I don't know who they can trust
right now.

May I, pretty please, suggest that we're talking about ZD as if it were a
monolithic organization when this is far from the truth?  When PC Mag, PC
Week, PC Computing, et alia get together, there is considerable diversity of
opinion as to what should be tested, against what criteria, based on what
model of the target reader.  It's really a waste of time to accuse many
different publications with independent editorial management of any kind of
Windows-oriented Groupthink.

Does anyone remember a few years back, when publications were accused of being
whores for IBM and Microsoft because we did give ample space to the
then-nascent OS/2?  How people said, essentially, "Why are you trying to make
us buy 4-MB machines when DOS works so well?"  How the attitude has changed.
Guys, we write about products with potential for solving readers' needs.
Period.  Sometimes that potential is a direct result of marketplace support --
we can't limit ourselves to considering strictly the technical elegance of a
platform and ignore developer support.  Let's be realistic?

Hmmmmmmm,  So you are telling me that ZD doesn't like Will Z. writing bad
things about Windows because that is the market place opinion !????   I cannot
argue that ZD owns the magazine and should have a say so about the topics. But
if they are going to claim to be objective in these articles ( reviews and Op
Ed pieces ) then they had better be able to take the good with the bad. The
particular item that upsets me is not that they asked Will to write more about
Windows, but that when he says something bad about Windows they go ape!


If they think Will is being inaccurate or just plain biased, then they should
say so.  But given the story as told here, the problem seems to more of
corporate bias.

BTW, is 700,000 copies shipped not an indication that at least a few people
think OS/2 provides some of these solutions ?

Peter,

My statement about the lack of objectivity in the computer-press applies to
many publications, not just PC-week or other ZD mags.  For example, I've been
reading Byte for five years, and it used to be pretty good, but lately I've
noticed the same kind of biased reporting people have been complaining about
in PC-week.  Take last months issue, where they had a two-page BS NT press
release printed as news - this is a magazine that, previously, it was
difficult to get a top-quality review unless you had a top-quality product,
and you got it into their hands and proved it.  Now they print anything that's
got MS stamped on it even though the product won't even be available for at
least 6 months.  People need a magazine that gives them the straight facts,
not a lot of "buy this just because it's a Windows product even if you're
perfectly productive with your DOS program".

If you know of any magazine that has this kind of objectivity, let me know,
and I'll be more than happy to take a look at it.

        As we are all aware and much to our dismay,  Will Zachmann is going to
leave Ziff-Davis at the end of September.  This as a result of pressure to
have his column, under the PC Week section "OPINION", stiffled and redirected.

         I don't know about you folks but the last time I checked the word
"Opinion" in  Websters, it meant "a view, judgement, or appraisal formed in
the mind about a particular matter."  Will's column have always reflected just
that. The apparent actions of the management of PC Week smacks of newsreels
from 1938 and drones in brown shirts...
        As such I have decided to take upon myself the task of delivering to
Ziff-Davis publications in New York City written your concerns about this
situation.
        All those interested can private E-MAIL them to me and I will
personally take them to Ziff as I live only 25 miles north of the city.

<<

Look at Computer Shopper some time, a ZD publication.  All of the reviews and
such are completely self-serving, always recommending you buy mail-order items
and providing mostly inaccurate technical comparisons.

Good for advertisers, but self-serving.  What used to serve people selling
used computers and orphaned computers (TI99, Commodore 128, etc.), now takes
advantage of ignorant customers buying their first computer.  I hear again and
again how people are convinced "it must be cheaper" without any regard to what
they are even shopping for.

Read some of the reviews in PC magazine; you get the impression that ""street
price"" is your local computer store.  NOT!  They always say "you should be
able to pick one up at street price of $xxx," where this amount is some
mail-order vendor selling at $20.00 over cost on a $1000 item.  Who supports
the items?!?  Who is there to assist a purchaser in using it for a specific
need?

I'm not saying that there isn't a market for low-ball pricing, but I wish to
point out an obvious problem.  These types of magazines appeal to the NEW
(IGNORANT) PURCHASER who most likely needs the most assistance.  The magazine
promotes what sells advertising space, not what helps the customer truly save
time and money.

Much of what I said can be applied to ZD other publications, except on a
higher level concerning operating systems and application software.  I'm not
saying that all of the reviews are inaccurate and deceptive, just that little
is done to put things in perspective.  Computers are a productivity tool.  How
can a magazine spend 30 pages reviewing 17" monitors, and only spend a few
discussing a product like OS/2?!  I'm not saying that there isn't a need for
good technical comparisions, just that they serve to sell more advertising
space.  How are you going to sell new items showing people how to get more out
of their existing computer hardware or software?

There needs to be a balance between "quest for $$," and "what is good for the
customer."  We will all tolerate advertisements on their own pages, maybe even
a biased press release in a special section.  Should we tolerate self-serving
editorial and biased reviews?

Not mentioning something, such as OS/2, can also damage credibility for a
product.  And, obviously, credibility for a magazine.

I write a column for PC Week that is, so far as I know, unique: it is based
strictly on interviews with our Corporate Lab Partners, about three dozen
organizations chosen to match a statistical profile of our readers, and each
week presents the buying concerns of a contact at a CLP organization. We have
talked in that column about OS/2 -- positively -- and also about Windows --
both positively and negatively.  We have also talked about 17-inch monitors,
'cause that's what Unocal was concerned about that week. And the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wants more software support for 24-bit
color.  And Baxter Healthcare Corporation wants applications to work more
cooperatively with network management utilities.

We mention what readers really care about.  We do constant research to be sure
we're living up to that goal.  Your mileage may vary.

I don't say this with rancor, Arthur, so please don't misunderstand me, but,
I'm afraid most reading this have already made up their mind, regardless of
what is true.

To answer your direct question, each publication is different because it
addresses different readerships. PC Week's constituency is different from ours
(PC/Computing's). Also, no, large scale editorial issues aren't decided by the
same people at ZD. For the same reason that there are different mags for
different readerships--there just 'aint one point of view that works for
everyone.

I am perplexed by trying to understand the distinction.

I know you don't shoot the father for the crimes of the son, but you may blame
the father for not bringing up the son correctly.

In this case, the son works for the father's business and the father has a
*responsibility* to AND for the son actions.

Will is/was in your family, and though your message said "not sticking up for

at censorship of the press of any kind wether you agreed with Will's opinion
or not.

I don't know how you have a problem with the difference PC Magazine is a
bi-monthly which mostly covers comparative hardware and software reviews.
PC-WEEK is a weekly newspaper that is mostly interested in industry news.

They are both owned and operated by Z-D but I think the 'chain of command'

I don't believe that at all.  I have clearly noticed distinct bias in at least
two Ziff Publications, PC Magazine and Computer Shopper (CS).  A few weeks
back I was at odds with several CS staff people over an article which
mentioned *current* upgrade paths from existing products.  One was Windows 3.1
(which is true) and the other was NT, which is not even in beta. There was no
mention of OS/2 which was available.  The Windows 3.1 and OS/2 2.0 issue of PC
magazine was clearly biased as well.  Particularly when you consider the
article written by the Editor-in-Chief, Micheal Miller, Comparisons between
the two operating enviorments.  Or how about the 17" monitor issue where each
monitor reviewed included numerous references to Windows.

Sorry, But the buying reader *is* being ripped-off by Ziff Publications. And
those who buy those publications to get objective reviews need to be aware of
this possible conflict of interest.

Not really.  You are talking frequency of publication, and publication target.
I am talking moral responsibility.

OK, how is PC-Magazine morally responsible for the actions of the people who
work for PC-WEEK?

 Ben It's not PCMag's responsibility... if you intrepreted that, either I was not
 as precise or you mis-intrepreted what I said.

 There's an expression I am sure you are familiar with, "The Buck Stops Here".

 In this case, *I* feel, and you can disagree, of course, that the "here" is
 the very end of the line, Mr. Ziff.

Bruce..

I'm sorry but I didn't really understand your message--perhaps it's because I
threw my back out and it really hurts.

No matter, I'll try to clarify what I meant when I said that I was "not
sticking up for anybody." I meant that _I_ didn't know the facts of the case.
I know what Will _said_, and I know that Sam Whitmore at PCWeek made a short
statement but I don't know who's right (and I suspect lots of people jumping
to support Will don't _know_ who's right.) I'm also not saying Will is not
telling the truth, but you know that it's possible to leave things out, put
different spins on things, etc. I'm certain that Will believes himself to be
right, even if he _might_ not be right.

Anyway, I was just trying to point out that I don't _know_ who's right and so
I wasn't defending anybody, neither Will nor PCWeek..

Does that help?

I'm not blaming it all on PC Magazine, but that's the magazine I read the
most, and there is hardly any OS/2 coverage in it, but there's plenty of
Windows coverage.

I have also seen people complaining on PC Magazines forum that PC Magazine
seems biased towards Microsoft and biased against IBM, so I'm talking about
what I know best.

I really don't know what exactly happened at PC Week, but it sounds like it's
just more of the same.

<< but it is interesting that you blame all of this on PC Magazine when, in
fact, it's all been happening at PC Week.>>

Not hardly!  PC Mag has been every bit as biased.  I've written letters
because of the blatant bias.  And it's not just at the editorial level.  When
"Advisor" columns, written in response to legitimate questions from
"unsuspecting" users tell people to ignore OS/2, because Windoze (3.1) pretty
much offers the same thing (not even bothering to mention such things a
Multi-tasking, etc.), then I'd call that EXTREME bias, hardly a "balanced,
responsible, response".  It's one thing for IBM to have to fend off the
legitimate problems with OS/2, like some of the hardware support issues in the
initial GA release.  It's another thing entirely, when biased publications,
poison users minds with PURE GARBAGE, such that IBM has to spend all of it's
initial efforts just trying to CORRECT all the lies and misconceptions about
the product, before it can begin to truly market the product.

Needless to say, I have a STRONG opinion about your statement <G>.  I will
note further, that NONE of my letters to PC Mag, regarding their "reporting",
were EVER published.  It seems they're not too much into the "constructive
criticism" approach.

Hi, Marvin.. It's nice to calmly share views about things, isn't it?

I was _specifically_ referring to the Zachmann incident. I won't argue with
you re: your opinions, nor will I even try to defend PC Magazine for their
editorial content. I was just pointing out in my original message in this
thread that a lot of people are blaming PCMagazine for the Zachmann thing
when, so far, it seems to be solely an issue between Will and PC Week. I'll
recant if that's not true but I've not seen anything from Will to support it..

Comrade Scudman,

When I saw Wills post I replied that time may not permit writing, but I am
beginning to believe that I should add my words to this "Weaselgate" matter.
When do expect to go? my time is slim this week as I am almost on my way out
the door, but will e-mail something next week if it fits into your schedule.

Patrick,

What word processor format can you handle or would you prefer an ASCII text
file.  Even though I'm vacationing this week (and trying to stay away from the
office computers), I will take time to put something on paper in this matter.
The policies at PCweak, Windows [nee PC] Magazine, and Computer Rip-off (and I
have received all three for several years) for editorial honesty, technical
quality, and now editorial freedom are totally screwed up.

Perhaps the loss of a gentleman with Mr. Zachmann's stature will serve as a
wake-up call to Mr. Ziff.  If not, I can only hope that Messers Dvorak,
Seymour, Salemi, and others will have the guts to follow (soon).  Otherwise, I
will be evaluating my subscriptions very carefully when they are due for
renewal late this fall.

     ... Joe

Patrick - (to take to ZD)

ZD is trying to grow - and is advertising the large lab they have set up. Why
bother? If I cannot trust the objectivity of ZD, I cannot afford the time to
read from ZD. I also cannot afford to argue against mis-information from ZD
that managers at work have gained - so I will post what has happened so far -
and the future results - at all compainies I work for/with.

I reccomend the same to others here. Fighting for sanity in PC hardware and
software purchases is hard enough. Let's get rid of ALL non-objective reports
that we can.

Do you really believe that hauling a bunch of letters down from "OS/2 zealots"
is going to do the trick? I think not. Actually, the best way to act is to
stop purchasing any products from ANY company that advertises in a ZD
publication. If others are hurt, they'll either pull their ads in tacit
support of objectivity because their bottom line is being touched, or they'll
take the same side as MS and ask for special objectivity in their favor. A one
week boycott of any product in a ZD publication by the entire industry would
have a little more voice than a handful of pages.

David,

Intersting comment. So I went back to the hardcopies sent and did a complete
scan. In not one of the email messages is there a mention of OS/2. Secondly,
75 to 80% of the messages received are from individuals whom I have never
heard of.  I agree that a boycott should begin. So why don't YOU start a
thread suggesting just that. All I'm trying to do is support Will and possibly
help achieve a positive outcome for all of us.

If you intend to boycott any company that advertises in a Ziff-Davis
publication, you're pretty much talking about boycotting the entire desktop
computer industry, sorry to say!! <g> And that includes most Macintosh
products (Z-D publishes MacUser and MacWeek).

So? The industry as a whole (manufacturers) would have to take a stand on
whether they are going to support unbiased reporting or not. As consumers we
can most effectively vote with our dollars, not our mouths or letters.
