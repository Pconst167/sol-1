                    Extracts from Corrupt Computing BBS
                   -------------------------------------

Hi darren,
             I think this BB is the best in the UK plus I think the way 
that you portrayed real hackers in Popular Comp very good. I have a no 
that you may be interested in  its for BT  its 016082420 and the code 
s MIRACLE ( In capitals ).   I was wondering if you could give me any 
info on phone phreaking as my phone bills are getting beyond a joke. PS 
do you know of the codes for Infotel  I had a user name  I dont know if 
it works though  its 813534 .

Thanks for the 0800 number. I gave it a try and connected using V25bis.
Once connected press ESC and the press return a few times and 
'INFORMER' inforamation and set up is displayed. When it asks for the 
password press ESC first and you will be allowed one entry. Thats as 
far as I get. Any ideas !!!!

I dont believe you can ever add credits to a phone card using nail 
varnish. I alaways thought they worked like this:
A laser scans the stripe (which is a hologram, and therefore very 
difficult to reproduce), and the credits are removed by stamping them 
out (you can see the "track"left by the stamper outer if you look close 
enough).

Hello again Darren. Just been reading up on PSS, and there are a few
points I am unsure about... I take it I get billed for the phone-time
used in accessing PSS. This goes straight onto by phone bill. Do the
other charges go onto my phone bill, or do they get charged to the
User whose NUI I am using? Forgive my ignorance! My nearest PSE is in
Manchester. Would a call to Germany on PSS cost the same as a local PSS
connection? I gather it's based on records sent, not distance.
Also.. Does your system have any scheduled maintenance period? I Phoned
at 11 on the 15th, got halfway thru' the title screen, and got dropped
off!. Cheers, Matt.

Subject: Phone Bill

Sh*t! My college just got the phone bill , it was 300 pounds the 
teachers were not pleeased. 
So please can anyone help me? Is there anyway of getting long disôance 
phone calls at local call rates ? 
 Are there peRhaps NUI's you can use which would allow me for e.g. to 
call CCUK at local call rates. When you phone american BBS's through 
PSS you can call at local rates.
Thanks Shuker,

Subject: HACKING

Well, I am Sure that most of your users are keen on hacking, so 
here is a nice little telephone number 4 U
The number will get you in to a computer of a company, unfortunatly
I only have the password to get into the wordprocessing department,
but it is not a complex system, and I am sure that you will be able
to work out thå other passwords!!
The speed that I got through at was v21 (300/300), and I do not know
if the system will allow any other speeds.
So here it is... THE phone number
                 --------------
                /(021) 706-3387\
                ----------------
(like the artwork??!!)
and now, ladies and gentlemen, the all important... password...is
ta da da da da da
JUDITH
YES
JUDITH
(high security huh!)
the password must be in caps, or the system wont allow you access
here are a few commands I have worked out.
off ... back to main menu
p on/ p off   printer on off ( i have currently set it to laser printer)
paste
?  ... help
oh well there you go. I hope that this intrests y'all
Thats all folks

Subject: PSS

I'm new to hacking and was hoping someone can give me some info. 
Firstly on this board is many computer addresses. But first I take it 
that you must use an NUA first - whenever I  so the PSS just replies
NUA? again - also when I type in a successful NUA and the an address it 
always replies something like CALL(41) 00:00:00:00 etc. What am I doing 
wrong.

Subject: Breaking and entering

Hi...Its me again, a little tip which may be of interest, or it may be 
common knowledge, but here goes anyway, I find that with my setup (CBM 
A500, Voyeger 7 modem) that if I phone up an old board in viewdata 
(1200/75), when I get the prompt for the password, if I keep pressing 
backspace, the computer gives me the epassword that was used by the 
last person to log on, this works on the owl service, but NOT on 
Prestel, but then who wants to use prestel??!!!
I cant give you the number for the OWL service at the moment, as it is 
stored on another disk, but on my next log-on I shall send it in as a 
message, also if any one wants a copy, I have a list of over 100 phone 
numbers,, and some companys, eg, george heath motors, ford, IBM 
the entire PSS list
comshare, G.R.Ealot of these numbers are numbers I downloaded from the 
national BB list, but some are ones that I have come across by other 
means!!, anyway I have no wish to make a profit from this, but i dont 
wish to make a loss either! so if you send me a SAE, and 25p for paper, 
ribbon etc.. I will be glad to send you a list, or if the sysop wishes 
to he could get a copy,and put it on a file for all to download. The 
reason that I cant upload it for all to share is because I lack the 
correct software. Sorry. anyway, heres the address to write to..
