Scene:  A cafe.  One table is occupied by a group of Vikings with horned 
        helmets on.  A man and his wife enter. 
 
Man (Eric Idle): You sit here, dear. 
Wife (Graham Chapman in drag): All right. 
Man (to Waitress): Morning! 
Waitress (Terry Jones, in drag as a bit of a rat-bag): Morning! 
Man:      Well, what've you got? 
Waitress: Well, there's egg and bacon; egg sausage and bacon; egg and spam; 
          egg bacon and spam; egg bacon sausage and spam; spam bacon sausage 
          and spam; spam egg spam spam bacon and spam; spam sausage spam spam 
          bacon spam tomato and spam; 
Vikings (starting to chant): Spam spam spam spam... 
Waitress: ...spam spam spam egg and spam; spam spam spam spam spam spam baked 
          beans spam spam spam... 
Vikings (singing):  Spam!  Lovely spam!  Lovely spam! 
Waitress:  ...or Lobster Thermidor a Crevette with a mornay sauce served in a 
          Provencale manner with shallots and aubergines garnished with 
          truffle pate, brandy and with a fried egg on top and spam. 
Wife:     Have you got anything without spam? 
Waitress: Well, there's spam egg sausage and spam, that's not got much spam in 
          it. 
Wife:     I don't want ANY spam! 
Man:      Why can't she have egg bacon spam and sausage? 
Wife:     THAT'S got spam in it! 
Man:      Hasn't got as much spam in it as spam egg sausage and spam, has it? 
Vikings:  Spam spam spam spam (crescendo through next few lines) 
Wife:     Could you do the egg bacon spam and sausage without the spam then? 
Waitress: Urgghh! 
Wife:     What do you mean 'Urgghh'? I don't like spam! 
Vikings:  Lovely spam! Wonderful spam!) 
Waitress: Shut up! 
Vikings:  Lovely spam! Wonderful spam! 
Waitress: Shut up!  (Vikings stop) Bloody Vikings!  You can't have egg bacon 
          spam and sausage without the spam. 
Wife (shrieks): I don't like spam! 
Man:      Sshh, dear, don't cause a fuss.  I'll have your spam.  I love it. 
          I'm having spam spam spam spam spam spam spam beaked beans spam spam 
          spam and spam! 
Vikings (singing):  Spam spam spam spam.  Lovely spam!  Wonderful spam! 
Waitress: Shut up!! Baked beans are off. 
Man:      Well could I have her spam instead of the baked beans then? 
Waitress: You mean spam spam spam spam spam spam...  (but it is too late and 
          the Vikings drown her words) 
Vikings (singing elaborately):  Spam spam spam spam.  Lovely spam!  Wonderful 
          spam!  Spam spa-a-a-a-a-am spam spa-a-a-a-a-am spam.  Lovely spam! 
          Lovely spam!  Lovely spam!  Lovely spam!  Lovely spam!  Spam spam 
          spam spam!
