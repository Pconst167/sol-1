Another neat trick for igniting napalm and so on is to take an ordinary solar
igniter (rocket) and dip it into a 50/50 mix of sodium and kerosene that is 
boiling. This coats the tip with sodiumoxide which is highly inflamable. Then
when you use the battery to ignite the modified igniter, you can get temp. up
to 200 degrees.

I didn't type this on a Phreak board' cause it kinda belongs here.

It has come to many proples attention that it would be nice to have a 'cheese
box' of the sort that you could call one number (pref. a pay phone) and
get a dial tone of a residential #.

This can be done with a resistor and 2 zeiner diodes.  But you first need
to find either a can (green things that stick out of the ground and say that
you will be shot if you dig near 'em) or a terminal box (located in sewers,
etc.)  If you find one, make a note of it!  My electronics guru is drawing
up plans as I type it and I may make a really short g-phile.

Unfortunatly, this is not a perfect chese box--if either the guy whose
phone you tap or someone at the pay phone picks up the reciver, they
get your conversation.  If the pay phone is busy, so is the box, and
if the guy is busy, it is about the perfect tap.  Either way, repair
ends up with a call, and that pay phone would be traced so fast that
nobody could tell it (busts galore!) well, it's worth a try...

i read in an old book on model rocketry that a 3:1 mixture (by weight) of
kno3 and sugar is what is in most model rocket engines. has anyone tried it?

also if you want a quick fuse, leave some napalm strips (2mm diameter) out
for a week or so (i know this works with the styro+gas recipe)

(this makes a good slow fuse)

I must agree with Peter, oil & gas is pretty bad news.  It's pretty good for
remote ignition, though.  Get yourself an alarm clock, a battery and a Estes
rocket launcher.

If you want to really scare someone, get a salad dressing bottle (for humor)
and put some saflower oil in it.  Then put a TINY bit of gas on that heavy oil.
Light it the normal way (like a gas bomb) and throw it at someone.  When the
gas lights, it will look deadly, but the saflower oil won't light, it will just
turn black and start to smoke like nothing you have ever seen.

THE BURNING OF A BUILDING IN ORDER TO COLLECT INSURANCE BENEFITS IS
COMMONLY TERMED JEWISH LIGHTENING (NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE IS INTENDED).
THE EASIEST (THOUGH NOT CHEAPEST) WAY TO TORCH YOUR OWN DOMICILE 
WITHOUT BEING DETECTED BY THE FIRE MARSHALL, IS TO USE A REMOTE DEVICE.
FIRST YOU WILL NEED A SOUND DETECTION DEVICE, SUCH AS THE TYPE THEY USE
FOR BURGLAR ALARMS. ALL THIS DEVICE NEED DO IS TURN ON AN ELECTRICAL
APPLIANCE WHEN SOUND IS DETECTED. NEXT, OPEN THE BACK OF YOUR TELEVISION
UP AND SCRAPE THE PROTECTIVE WAX OFF THE PICTURE TUBE. THIS SUCKER 
HEATS UP WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR TV ON, AND THE COATING PROTECTS THE REST
OF THE SET FROM THE TUBE. NEXT MAKE A SMALL (VERY SMALL) HOLE IN ONE
OF YOUR NATURAL GAS LINES (SO THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS IN THE HOUSE).
IF YOU DON'T HAVE GAS, LEAVE SOME NEWSPAPERS OR RAGS AROUND THE TV.
NEXT HOOK THE TV UP TO THE SOUND DETECTOR AND TURN THE DETECTOR ON.

NOW YOUR SET. ALL YOU NEED DO IS LEAVE YOUR HOUSE (MAKING SURE THE
NEIGHBORS SEE YOU) AND CALL YOUR HOUSE NUMBER FROM A PHONE BOOTH.
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS, IT WILL CAUSE THE DETECTOR TO TURN THE TV ON, HEAT
UP THE TUBE AND IGNITE THE GAS. THE RESULT IS POOF!!!! 
NOTE: I CAN'T RECOMMEND OR CONDONE THIS PRACTICE DUE TO ITS DANGER
TO HUMAN LIFE. THIS IS POSTED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND I

Hey guys, here's a really great trick if you really want to scare someone,
and, it's soooooo easy! well........... get some Iodine crystals and some filte
r paper(coffee filter). put the filter in a funnel over a box or the ground
(NOT YOUR SINK!!!!), put the iodine crystals in it and pour amonia SLOWLY
over it. When saturated, scrape out of filter(carefully) and place in 
some cute little place.(stairs, sidewalk (if you want to kill someone,
put it in their gas tank.))It'l dry and become so unstable that if you let
even a GENTLE fart on it it will blow your 'nads to Jersey.THIS STUFF IS
VERY UNSTABLE< ESPECIALLY WHEN DRY!
