                                The OCF Constitution



          As ratified or amended by votes of the OCF membership: 3 February
          1989



                                      Preamble

          We, the computer using community of the Berkeley  campus  of  the
          University   of  California,  provide  by  this  Constitution  an
          organization dedicated to the pursuit of obtaining  and  managing
          open  computing resources.  The intent of this organization is to
          provide an environment  where  no  member  of  Berkeley's  campus
          community is denied the computer resources he or she seeks.  This
          group's spirit can be traced directly to the former Undergraduate
          Computing  Facility,  however  this  organization's membership is
          much more widely open.  It is also the intent of  this  group  to
          appeal  to  all  members  of  the  Berkeley campus community with
          unsatisfied computing needs and to  provide  a  place  for  those
          interested  in  computing  to fully explore that interest.  It is
          the intention of this group that no small number of  people  ever
          control   the   accessibility  of  any  OCF  sponsored  computing
          facility.

                      contact all members of the OCF.

                      abstaining votes) is required. If on the first ballot
                      no  candidate  receives a simple majority, then there
                      will be a runoff between the top two candidates.  The
                      voting  will  continue until one candidate receives a
                      simple majority.

                      4.2.3.2.  Other Votes
                      All other votes require a simple majority to pass.

                      4.2.3.3.  Proxy
                      An OCF Member must be present at a meeting to vote.

          5.  Faculty Sponsors
          The OCF Faculty Sponsors shall consist of  a  faculty  member  or
          faculty  members who are dedicated to the functioning of the OCF.
          These Faculty Sponsors shall be selected  by  the  OCF  Board  of
          Directors  and  shall  be  subject to selection by the OCF at the
          Elections Meeting.
