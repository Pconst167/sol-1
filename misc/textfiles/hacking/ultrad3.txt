The idea of writing a WARGAMES dialer was inspired by Steve Klein who
wrote the original DIAL.BAS.  I took this program and proceeded to cre-
ate DIAL1 and DIAL3 (Steve Klein took DIAL1 and enhanced it to DIAL2).
I began to get sick of constantly updating so I decided to write the
most incredible dialer around, and I think I have succeded.  In the
first version of ULTRA-DIAL (ULTRA.EXE), there were many problems, in-
cluding the fact that it did NOT support the Hayes External Modem,
this minor error was fixed and a few other features were added into
ULTRA2.EXE, the next version.  I though I had it all down pat with this
version, but my "good ol'" users clued me in to some problems...and
here it is folks, ULTRA3.EXE.  I would like everyone to know that this
will be the last version of ULTRA-DIAL, UNLESS I find some incredible
error or some new incredible request for a feature is made.  So, you'll
have to live with this one.

REMEMBER: This program is for the IBM Personal Computer PC or XT (not
AT or any compatible).  You must have a Hayes modem (an Anchor Signal-
man may work, it has not been tested) to operate this program.  There
is absolutely no exceptions to this...sorry.

      Now we'll cut the lecture and start the documentation!

---------------------------------------------------------------------



** MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

     To operate UltraDial 3.0, you need at least the following:

                    An IBM Personal Computer
                           64k Memory
                      One Floppy Disk Drive
                     A Hayes Auto-Dial Modem

     To operate UltraDial 3.0 with optimum performance, add:

                      An 80 Coulumn Printer
                           128k Memory
                       A RAMdrive Program


** TO BEGIN

     To   start   UltraDial,   place  the  disk   that   contains
ULTRA3.EXE in drive A: and type:

A>ULTRA3

     Within  a few moments,  a text screen should appear  telling
you  the  rules of Com-Worx.   Press a key and you will  see  the
title  screen begin. After the "COM-WORX Presents..." portion, you
will be asked to select COM1: or COM2:, that is communications port
number 1 or communications port #2.  Enter the port to which your
modem is connected to (enter a 1 or a 2).
     Then you will see the main title screen...press any key to go
further...
     The program will then ask you to set the time and date.   If
it is already set, simply hit <ENTER> at each of the prompts.
     Finally  the menu screen will appear and you will have  the
following options:

               [B]egin a dialing routine
               [S]can/Dial found numbers
               [P]rint a copy of numbers
               [C]ontact the author
               [D]elete old numbers
               [Q]uit to DOS

     These options are explained in detail on the following
pages of this documentation...



** BEGIN A DIALING ROUTINE

     This command is the master command of the entire program,
it sets the dialing in motion.  You will be using this command
whenever you wish to start dialing...

      Your first prompt will be "Do you wish to delete old
numbers that have been found?".  This simply means, do you want
to erase the file that  contains the  previously found numbers
with carriers and start with a fresh one, or do you want to save
them. Answer "Y" to start a fresh new file, or enter "N" to save
the old one (remember, Ultra3 can only handle 18 numbers per file
because of some problems, print out the file often and start a
fresh one when possible).
     The second option is simple, "Do you want the modem speaker
on?".  Answer "Y" if you want the Hayes internal speaker on, and
answer "N", if you want it off (this is also togglable during the
program operation).
     Ok, now you are going to enter the vital numbers that will
make this program run.  The next prompt, after the speaker prompt,
is the "PRELIMINARY NUMBER" prompt.  This is a new feature to ULTRA
DIAL and I will try to explain it the best I can.
     Whatever you enter at the PRELIMINARY NUMBER prompt will be
dialed before EVERY number.  This can be helpful for obtaining an
outside line (i.e. hotels and buisnesses sometimes require you dial
a "9" before dialing the outside number you wish to reach).  If you
have no use for this, simply hit <ENTER>, if you do want to use this
function, enter the number(s) you wished to be dialed before EVERY
number in the dialing sequence.
     Now you are going to enter the starting and ending numbers! Your
first prompt will be to enter the area code, if you want to dial local
simply hit <ENTER>, if not, enter the three digit area code.
     The next prompt will be for the beginning number, this will be
the first number to be dialed.  Here are some examples of the right
and wrong way to enter numbers:

RIGHT: 9861673                         WRONG: 986-1673
       5205547                                5,205547

*** REMEMBER: DO NOT USE HYPHENS, COMMAS, ETC.  JUST ENTER THE NUMBER!

     The next prompt will be for the ending number, the last number
to be dialed.  Use the same format as you saw above.
     Now the dialing begins...Your options are now held in function
keys (the darker keys on the left side of the keyboard).  There func-
tions are described here...


[F1] - SKIP # - allows you to skip on to the next phone number.
                For example, if the computer is on 986-1673 and
                you hit [F1] then it will skip to 986-1674 as
                soon as you hear the beep.

[F2] - MAIN   - takes you directly to the main menu and stops all
                active dialing.   (Quits to the menu)

[F3] - QUIT   - ends the dialing and returns you to DOS.

[F4] - PAUSE  - pauses the timer so as to allow more waiting time
                and continues to hold the timer until you hit any
                key (remember to re-start it with any key).

[F5] - SPKR   - toggles the speaker on or off. When pressed, the
                screen will clear and you will be asked if you
                want the speaker on or off, then dialing will re-
                sume from the number you left off on.

*** REMEMBER: THE FUNCTION KEYS TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO RESPOND!

     If the dialer finds a carrier at a certain number, it beeps,
saves the number to disk, and continues dialing.  If it completes
the dialing routine by getting to the last number, it sounds an
alarm to inform you (until you press any key).  You are then
returned to the main menu.



** SCAN/DIAL FOUND NUMBERS

     This function allows you to see up to 18 of the found
numbers in the file NUMBERS.  You can select a number with the up
and down cursor keys on the right side of the keyboard.  If at
first the arrow does not move when you hit the cursor up or down,
try hitting <NumLock>.  When you have the arrow pointing at the
number you wish to try, hit <ENTER>.
     The computer will enter a terminal mode.  Anything you type
now will go straight to the modem.  The computer will dial the
number you selected and wait for a carrier.  When it receives a
carrier, it will connect at 300 baud, even parity, 7 data bits,
and 1 stop bit.
     To exit the terminal mode and return to the main menu, hit
the <ESC> key, up in the left hand corner of the keyboard.  It
will ask if you wish to dial another number and you may respond
accordingly with "Y" or "N".



** PRINT A COPY OF NUMBERS

     This function will print a copy of all of the phone numbers
onto the printer.  Also, the dates and times that the numbers
were found will be printed.  When the printing is complete, the
computer will return to the main menu...



*** CONTACT THE AUTHOR

    This function was just "an idea" that I thought would encourage
people to report errors more often because it would be so simple to
conatct me.  This function will simply enter the terminal mode and
dial The COM-WORX RBBS...Hit <ESC> to hang-up and exit...



** DELETE OLD NUMBERS

     This function will erase the file NUMBERS which contains all
of the phone numbers that have been found.  You should use this
at least every 18 numbers found.



** QUIT TO DOS

     This function drops you into DOS (use only when you are
finished using Ultra-Dial).
