I. GENERAL DESCRIPTION

GALAXY STARLINK is an asynchronous outdial service that permits members to
make long distance modem-to-modem calls from various points around the
United States and Canada to computers in remote cities at a low hourly
cost.

There are, as of this date, over 1000 local access numbers and 142 outdial
modems in the United States and Canada.  A complete list of both local
access numbers and outdial cities are included with this guide.

GALAXY STARLINK uses the facilities of TYMNET, one of the world's largest
and most powerful networks, a division of McDonnell Douglas Network Systems
Company. TYMNET is also a leading supplier of private networks and is an
integral part of the networking portion of McDonnell Douglas Information
Services Company which had 1988 revenues of over 1.3 Billion Dollars.


II. SIGNING UP FOR SERVICE

GTC maintains a multiline signup and information bulletin board system with
up-to-date local access telephone numbers and outdial port number lists
which may be accessed by calling 804-495-4665 or 800-343-7304.

New members may sign up while on line using MasterCard or VISA credit cards
or by direct checking account debit.

Those who sign up by credit card are usually issued STARLINK usernames and
passwords within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after entering the
required information, if Validations can voice verify.

Those who sign up for direct checking account debit are mailed a members
agreement and must sign and return the agreement, along with the
registration fee and a voided check, before usernames and passwords can be
issued.

III. COST

FROM WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
-----------------------------
For members within the contiguous 48 states, there is a one-time $25
registration fee, a $10 monthly account maintenance fee and a $1.50 per
hour charge for use of the network between 7PM and 6AM, all day Saturdays
and Sundays, and the six major U.S. holidays.  The cost for daytime use is
$20 per hour.

Rates are higher from Alaska, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada
and are available upon request.

In addition to these rates, some cities are subject to local telephone
company "Zone" or "ZUM" rates. These are the so-called "meter rates" that
apply when calling to an out-lying area from the outdial modem.  These
charges can range from ten cents per call upwards and Starlink has no
choice but to pass those charges on to the member.  The worst areas
affected by these rates are Chicago, Los Angeles and the entire states of
New Jersey and California. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, there is a twenty
cents per call charge to reach Exec-PC.

STARLINK provides the ability to make long distance calls to BBSes outside
the outdial local area and neither promotes the use of nor restricts your
ability to make these calls.  Just be aware that in some cases intrastate
calls can be more expensive than calls across the country.

You should also be aware that in New Jersey, it is possible to dial long
distance without putting a "1" in front of the number.

The best source of information about whether a call is long distance to a
BBS is the Sysop of that BBS.  Every sysop is well aware of what exchanges
can reach his BBS with a local call.  Ask him when you make your first call
to his BBS.  Please don't ask STARLINK!  We don't know!  There are
thousands of exchanges in the United States, we couldn't possibly be aware
of the rates in every city in the U.S.  You can help though, by looking in
the front of your local telephone book and compiling a list of local
exchanges if you live in a outdial city and uploading the list to the
/Starlink SIG on Galaxy.  Other members will then be aware of where they
can call in your city without incurring a long distance call.

FROM SELECTED FOREIGN COUNTRIES
-------------------------------
For members residing in foreign countries whose postal and telegraph
services permit gateway connections to TYMNET (International access
number 3106), STARLINK service is also available.

Foreign members must establish an account with STARLINK via telephone
or mail before receiving a STARLINK Username and Password.  The only
payment method that STARLINK will accept from foreign members is
MasterCard or VISA (Interbank Cards).

The registration fee for foreign members is $50.00, off-peak hourly
fees are $3.00 per hour and day-time usage is $35.00 per hour. This is
in addition to the fees charged by your local PTT to reach the TYMNET
gateway.

Local Telephone company charges, as described above, apply to callers from
foreign countrys.

FOR ALL MEMBERS
---------------
Members who request printed bills are charged $5 and there is a $20
dishonored check or credit card charge.

Passwords may be changed at the members request for a $5 charge.

IV. GALAXY INFORMATION NETWORK

GTC maintains the GALAXY INFORMATION NETWORK Bulletin Board System for the
use of it's members and others. GIN contains a file library, special
interest groups, on-line games, electronic messaging, and other services.
STARLINK members receive TWO HOURS of unlimited usage of GIN each month as
the bills for STARLINK are left in an electronic message to the member each
month.  In addition, there is no charge to the member for time spent in the
Special Interest Groups on GIN whether the member is using the
teleconference feature or the message bases.  Normal charges of $2 per hour
are charged for the use of GIN's other features. A complete GIN User's
Guide is included with this file.

V. SIGNUP PROCEDURE

A potential member calls the STARLINK registration system by modem at 1200
bps with the settings of 8 data bits, No parity, and 1 stop bit and signs
up as a new user selecting a "handle" and password of his choosing.  After
determining that the service meets his/her needs, the user enters credit
card or checking account information which invokes an automatic process
wherein GTC causes a STARLINK username and STARLINK password to be created.

NOTE: The Galaxy User-ID or "handle" and Galaxy Password should not be
confused with the STARLINK Username and Password.  These are two altogether
different and distinct identification measures.  The GALAXY User-ID or
"handle" and Password are used to gain access to GIN.  The STARLINK
Username and Password are used to gain access to the STARLINK service on
TYMNET.

After a member has signed up for STARLINK service, the users account
information is transferred to the GALAXY system and an e-mail message is
written to the member containing his/her STARLINK Username and STARLINK
password.  The member calls the GALAXY system at 804-495-4636, logs on
using the "handle" and password he/she chose when signing up and retrieves
the STARLINK information.

INTERNATIONAL MEMBERS MUST CALL 804-467-4887 BY VOICE TO REGISTER.

VI.  USING STARLINK

As of April 1, 1989, there are 142 outdial "nodes". A complete list of
those outdial nodes is included with this file.  A "node" is a port on the
TYMNET network that may be reached through the network from a local access
number.  As of April 1, 1989 there are over 1,000 local access numbers
throughout the United States and Canada.

The member first determines, from the access number list, the local access
or "in-dial" number to the TYMNET network.  These are 1200 and 2400 bps
modems in the members home town reachable by a local telephone call.

<< SEE FOOTNOTE BELOW>>
The member, using a computer and communications program or terminal, dials
the local access number and is connected to the network.  The first
indication of connection is either a string of garbage or the phrase "enter
your terminal identifier".  Members using a personal computer should type
the "a" key with no carraige return at which point a "Please log in:"
prompt will be displayed.  The member then enters his/her STARLINK username
and password seperated by a semi-colon.  EXAMPLE: STA000000;password.  This
procedure will result in the STARLINK menu being displayed.

Note:  In most cases, a communications setting of 8 data bits, No parity
and 1 stop bit will work perfectly.  If it doesn't work on your local
access number, use 7 data bits, Even parity and 1 stop bit.

VII. THE STARLINK MENU

The STARLINK menu consists of a list of popular Bulletin Board Systems that
may be easily accessed by simply typing a number corresponding with the
selection the member wishes to connect to.  EXAMPLE:

                WELCOME TO STARLINK

        1. Galaxy Information Network
        2. EXEC-PC
        3. MEDCOM BBS
        4. AMUSERS
        5. American LINK-LINE
        6. MULTICOMM BBS
        7. Long Island Sound of Music
        8. Information
        9. Outdial Services

Selecting a number corresponding with a BBS will initiate a process
connecting you to that BBS.  No further keystrokes are necessary until the
BBS prompts you for log-in information. Selecting the number corresponding
to the "Information" selection will display information regarding the BBSes
on the menu.

VIII. OUTDIAL SERVICES

Selecting the number corresponding to "Outdial Services" will result in
you being prompted to enter the "outdial" port number you wish to connect
with.  For example, if you wish to connect with the outdial port in
Norfolk, Virginia, you would enter "6986" at this prompt. The following
information would then be displayed:

TYMNET ASYNC OUTDIAL 6986 (804)   857 NORFOLK , VA

>

At the ">" prompt, you may type "help" and receive the following screen:

>help

Set [Half] [Rxon] [Xon] [Even|Space] [Crdelay]
     Half    - sets half-duplex communications.  Default is full-duplex.
     Xon     - sets flow control for data you send.  Default is no xon.
     Rxon    - sets flow control for data you receive.  Default is no rxon.
     Even    - sets even parity for data sent.  Default is no parity.
     Space   - sets space parity for data sent.  Default is no parity.
     Crdelay - set printer carriage return delay.  Default is no delay.
Bps [300|1200|2400]
     Sets one of the baud rates indicated above.  Default is 2400 bps.
Dial [Tone] [Pulse] {phone number}
     Dials the requested phone number.  Parameters are:
         Tone  - activates touch-tone dialing.  Default is tone.
         Pulse - activates pulse dialing.
         Optional commas - provide a one second pause.  Default is no pause.
Retry   -  Redials last phone number.
Logout  -  Exits Outdial.
Help or ?  -  Prints this screen.

NOTES: * Dialed number need not be preceded by "9".
       * In some locations, long-distance numbers must be preceded by "1".


If, at this point, you wish to connect with a BBS whose phone number is,
for example, 555-1212, you would enter at the ">" prompt, the string
"d 5551212".  This causes the outdial modem to dial the number and connect
you at 2400 bps.  If the host BBS only has 1200 bps modems, you would need
to first enter "bps 1200" at the ">" prompt.  This sets the outdial modem
to call the host at 1200 bps rather than 2400 bsp.

If the BBS is busy you will usually receive a "BUSY" indicator, at which
point you can type "r" to redial the number or "logout" to disconnect and
return to the "please log in" prompt.  At the "please log in" prompt, you
may simply disconnect.


What does the connect string mean?

TYMNET ASYNC OUTDIAL 6986 (804)   857 NORFOLK , VA
                                 
                      :     :      :
         Outdial Port #  Area Code Local exchange

STARLINK permits you to make long distance calls from the outdial port.
You can determine if a BBS can be reached with a local call from an outdial
port by calling the operator in the destination city and asking if it is a
local call from the exchange.  For example: Virginia Beach exchange 495 is
a local call from Norfolk exchange 857.  If the BBS is outside the local
dialing area, you can still reach it by putting a "1" in front of the
number at the ">" prompt.  Example: "d 15551212". ALL LONG DISTANCE TOLL
CHARGES WILL BE CHARGED TO YOU!

IX. ERROR MESSAGES AND PROBABLE CAUSES

The following are common error messages and some causes:

HOST OUT OF PORTS
All available outdial modems at the outdial city are in use.

BUSY
The host BBS's phone lines are all busy.

CALL FAILED FOR UNKNOWN REASON
Usually indicates that a voice answered the phone call.  Call the number by
voice to determine if it is still a viable number.

Can also be caused by low quality modem on the BBS or the BBS only
operating at 1200 bps.  Try the "bps 1200" cure mentioned above.

Can also mean the BBS has all lines in use and the modem did not detect the
busy signal.

MODEM TIMED ITSELF OUT - CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE
Modem malfunction or all BBS lines are busy. Please report this if it
happens more than once or twice.

X. SUGGESTIONS

There are some methods you can use to improve the STARLINK service from
your end.  The two most common complaints and the easiest to cure are file
transfer speedups and interactive response speedups.

To improve file transfers:

Enter a control-V before typing in your STARLINK username.  Example:
"STA000000;password".  This means hold down your control key and tap the
"V" key before entering your Username.  This opens up the band width and
greatly improves file transfer time.

To improve interactive response time:

Enter a control-I before your STARLINK username.  Example:
"	STA000000;password".  Enter this the same way as the example above and
the response time through the network will be faster.  Perfect for chatting
or e-mail, etc.

Members calling a 2400 Baud BBS using a 1200 Baud modem can improve
file transfers and reduce error messages by putting control-X control-R
before the Username when logging on to the network.  This enables X-on,
X-off flow control and prevents the BBS from sending data to you faster
than you can accept it. Never use Control-X, Control-R together with
Control-V.  It will really make a mess of things.

FILE TRANSFERS

Almost all BBS software requires that you transfer files at 8 data bits, No
parity and 1 stop bit.  If you are having trouble with file transfers this
will usually be the problem.  If you cannot access the network from your
local number at 8-N-1 and must log on at 7-E-1, have your software switch
to 8-N-1 after you have entered the ">d #######" command and before the BBS
connects.  Some BBS software doesn't care what settings you use until you
try to transfer a file.  To prevent wasting valuable network time, it's
best to assume that you need 8-N-1 and change to that setting prior to
attempting a transfer.

XI. REPORTING STARLINK PROBLEMS

We value your business and will attempt to resolve any problem with the
network as quickly as possible.  The fastest way to let us know that a
problem exists is to post a message to "Galaxy" on GALAXY INFORMATION
NETWORK.  You will receive a reply to your message within 24 hours.  If you
are having trouble logging on, you may call 800-321-0156 by voice between
9AM and 5PM Eastern time.  Someone will usually be available to answer your
calls on weekends but this is not guaranteed.  E-Mail is faster and not
time dependent. If you are having a problem after 5PM and cannot wait until
the next day, you may call TYMNET customer service at 800-336-0149.  TYMNET
will help you with network problems only, they will not get involved with
billing questions, help with your communications program, or anything other
than network communications.  Please don't ask them to.

XII. BILLING QUESTIONS

Bills for network time are posted in an electronic message to you on Galaxy
and contain the total of the bill and the date your credit card was charged
or your bank account will be debited only.  If you desire a printed bill,
please request one by leaving an e-mail message to "Starlink" or "Galaxy".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOOTNOTE:
The STARLINK menu is not yet operational.  Until it becomes operational, to
reach an outdial city you must enter your Username, the 3 or 4 digit number
representing the city you wish to reach, and your STARLINK password.  They
must be entered at the TYMNET "please log in:" prompt as follows:

Network says:  You enter:
   |    :       :    :
please log in: USERNAME:####;password

For example:  Your Username is STA000000 and your password is "starman" and
you want to call Exec-PC in Milwaukee.  The Milwaukee outdial port
numberis 9167 and Exec-PC's telephone number is 964-5160.  At the "please
log in:" prompt you should enter:

    STA000000:9167;starman

you will then be connected to the Milwaukee outdial modem.  You will
receive a message informing you that you are connected and a ">" prompt. If
you are calling at 1200 baud you must enter "bps 1200" to tell the outdial
modem that you want to call Exec-PC at 1200 baud.  If you don't do this you
will receive garbage and your call will be in vain. 2400 baud users omit
this step.

Next, at the ">" prompt you should enter "d 9645160" which instructs the
outdial modem to call Exec-PC.  The modem will print a string of dots as it
is dialing the number.  During this time, you MUST switch your
communications parameters to 8 data bits, No parity, and 1 stop bit.
Exec-PC will NOT accept your call at 7-E-1.  You will then be connected to
Exec-PC and you proceed as you normally would if you had connected through
the standard telephone lines.

When you log off of Exec-PC, in almost every case you will be returned to
the "please log in:" prompt where you may simply hangup or hit the return
key a few times until the network logs you off.  It is perfectly allright
to just hang up at this prompt.  Should the network return you to the ">"
prompt after the BBS logs you off, simply type the word "logout" and you
will be returned to the "please log in:" prompt where you may safely
hangup.  NEVER just hangup at the ">" prompt, type "logout" first.

If you have problems, please read this complete file again before calling
customer service.  We have found that 99% of all problems are caused by
improperly entering the Username, outdial port number and password.
