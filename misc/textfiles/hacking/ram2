    ->REFERRAL NUMBERS

REFERRAL NUMBERS ENABLE THE USER TO
QUICKLY SPECIFY A SINGLE TRUNK GROUP IN
THE SYSTEM BY ITS NUMERIC REFERRANCE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE TRUNK GROUP 'TG123'
FROM OFFICE 'ABC' TO OFFICE 'XYZ' CAN
BE SPECIFIED BY A SINGLE NUMBER IN
RAMPART COMMANDS RATHER THAN ENTERING
THE NEAREND,FAREND, AND GROUP ID IN
THIER ENTIRETY.

NOTE: THE REFERRAL NUMBER FOR A PART-
ICULAR TRUNK GROUP MAY CHANGE IF THE DATABASE IS RE-COMPILED.

FORMAT: REF-ERRAL NUMBER
        RF NUMBER

THE EASIEST WAS TO DETERMINE THE REFER-
RAL NUMBER OF A TRUNK GROUP IS TO USE
THE 'DISPLAY TRUNK' COMMAND.

    ->DISPLAY TRUNK

DISPLAY TRUNK(GROUPS) NEAREND<FAREND>
<GROUP^ID> OR DISPLAY TRUNK (GROUP)
REFERRAL NUMBER

DISPLAYS DATABASE INFORMATION ON THE
TRUNK GROUP(S) SPECIFIED. INCLUDED IS
REFERRAL NUMBER, NEAREND, FAREND,
GROUP ID, NUMBER OF TRUNKS, SYSTEM
TRUNK NUMBERS, AND LIMITS DATA.

O  IF ONLY 'NEAREND' IS SPECIFIED, ALL
   TRUNK GROUPS ORIGINATING FROM THE
   OFFICE SPECIFIED ARE DISPLAYED

O  IF 'NEAREND' AND 'FAREND' ARE
   SPECIFIED, ALL GROUPS BETWEEN THESE
   TWO OFFICES ARE DISPLAYED

O  SPECIFYING 'NEAREND', 'FAREND', AND
   'GROUP^ID',OR SPECIFYING THE REFERAL
   NUMBER UNIQUELY DESCRIBES A SINGLE
   TRUNK GROUP.

    ->TRUNK

TRUNK NUMBERS

RAMPART USES TWO DIFFERENT TRUNK
NUMBERING SYSTEMS; NAMELY, USER TRUNK
NUMBERS AND SYSTEM TRUNK NUMBERS. USER
TRUNK NUMBERS ALWAYS START AT ONE, AND
END AT THE NUMBER OF TRUNKS IN THE
GROUP. SYSTEM TRUNK NUMBERS ARE THE
NUMBERS USED TO ACCESS TRUNKS ON THE
SWITCH AND MAY RANGE FROM 0 TO 65000.

FOR COMMANDS WHICH REQUIRE TRUNK
NUMBERS,THE '/SY' SWITCH SHOULD BE
ADDED TO THE COMMAND LINE WHEN REFER-
ENCING SYSTEM TRUNK NUMBERS.
