                                                   you wish to dial.

                                                   the computer that you
                                                   dialed. Procees as if
                                                   the  number was dialed
                                                   directly.


    NOTES:
    -----

    1. If the connection was not made, a BUSY will be seen within 30
       seconds. The BUSY message means that the number dialed was either
       busy, not in service, or an invalid attempt to dial more than 7
       digits. A BUSY will also be seen after disconnecting from the
       host computer, but you can dial another number by starting again
       at the fifth step and typing ATZ and dialing the number.

    2. PC Pursuit uses standard HAYES dialing commands, which enable
       you to type the A/ (no CR) command to redial the previously
       dialed number.

    3. When a typing mistake is made in the second and third steps,
       the log-on must be re-entered.
