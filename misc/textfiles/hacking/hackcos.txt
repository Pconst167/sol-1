  I HAVE SEEN MANY PHILES WRITTEN ON
COSMOS IN WHICH ALL THEY DID WAS TO
COPY THE INFORMATION OUT OF A COSMOS
MANUAL THEY FOUND WHILE TRASHING. THIS
TUTORIAL WILL HAVE SOME INFORMATION
FROM THE MANUAL, BUT MAINLY WAS WRIT
TEN USING INFORMATION OF FIRST-HAND
EXPERIENCE WHILE ON THE SYSTEM.

------
COSMOS- COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR
------  MAINFRAME OPERATIONS.

COSMOS, IS A WIRE CENTER ADMINISTRATION
SYSTEM FOR SUBSCRIBER SERVICES. OR PUT
ANOTHER WAY: AN INTER-OFFICE MEMO 
SENDER. ITS PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE:
 
1)TO RELIEVE THE PROBLEMS OF CONGESTION
  AND LONG CROSS CONNECTION ON THE MAIN
  DISTRIBUTING FRAME (MFD).
 
2)TO IMPROVE ENTITY LOAD BALANCE AND
  CUSTOMER LINE EQUIPMENT DISTRIBUTION
  ACCROSS THE WIRECENTERS SWITCHING
  EQUIPMENT.

3)TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE AND READILY
  ACCESSIBLE DATA BASE FOR USE BY ALL
  AT&T DEPARTMENTS.

4)THE LOOP ASSIGMENT OFFICE (LAC) USES 
  IT TO GENERATE ORDERS FOR RAM USE.

EACH TELCO HAS IT'S OWN COSMOS SYSTEM
USUALLY ONE IN EACH AREA CODE.
 
CAPABILITIES:
-------------

COSMOS IS POWER WITH IT YOU CAN
FIND OUT ALOT OF INFO SUCH AS:

GIVE COSMOS A NUMBER AND IT WILL TELL
YOU WHO IT'S BILLED TO, WHO ITS LISTED
UNDER, WHAT TYPES OF SERVICE THEY HAVE
(TOUCH TONE, ROTARY, FLAT RATE ETC.).

IF A PERSON CHANGES THIER FONE NUMBER
YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS CHANGED
TO.

YOU CAN FIND OUT NUMBERS BY GIVING
COSMOS THIER NAME, EVEN UNPUBLISHED
PHONE NUMBERS!


RISKS:
------

ONCE UNAUTHORIZED LOGINS ARE DETECTED,
THE COSMOS PHONE NUMBER(S) WILL BE
CHANGED IMMEDIATLY! ITS NO BIG DEAL
FOR THEM TO CHANGE THE NUMBER, THEY
JUST SEND OUT A LETTER TO THIER
OFFICES SAYING IT'S CHANGED. BUT
THEY PROBABLY THROW AWAY THOSE PAPERS
AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND ALOT OF
INTERESTING INPHO BY TRASHING.
ALSO, MOST OR ALL CALLS TO COSMOS ARE
TRACED, OR THE NUMBER HAS ANI EQUIP
MENT HOOKED UP TO IT, SO BE CAREFUL!


IDENTIFICATION:
---------------

COSMOS LOGINS AND PROCEEDURES VARY
FROM AREA TO AREA, SOME ASK FOR
JUST THE LOGIN AND PASSWORD WITHOUT
A WIRECENTER, OTHERS REQUIRE IT.
THE PHOLLOWING INFORMATION IS BASED
ON SOUTHERN BELL'S COSMOS SYSTEM.

TO IDENTIFY A COSMOS SYSTEM AFTER
CONNECTING YOU WILL SEE:

;LOGIN:
PASSWORD:
WC?

THE ;LOGIN: IS THE USERNAME, WHICH
USUALLY CONSISTS OF TWO LETTERS AND
TWO NUMBERS IE: PA52. SOMETIMES NAME:
IS SUBSTITUTED FOR, OR IS REQUIRED
WITH ;LOGIN: AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT
SYSTEM YOU ARE ON. NEXT IT WILL ASK
FOR THE PASSWORD: WHICH DEPENDING ON
THE SYSTEM, HAS DIFFERENT FORMATS FOR
PASSWORDS. SOME MAKE A LITTLE SENSE
LIKE BASE52 WHILE OTHERS MAY BE EIGHT
RANDOM CHARACTERS. LAST THING YOU WILL
SEE IS THE WIRECENTER. A WIRECENTER
IS USUALLY AN ABBREVIATION OF THE CITY
THAT IT COVERS. SUCH AS OA FOR OAKLAND
OR PP FOR PEMBROKE PINES, IN ANY CASE
IT IS TWO LETTERS. THE WIRECENTER WILL
COVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PREFIXES.
AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOOK UP
OTHER PHONE #'S UNLESS THE PREFIXES
ARE IN THE SPECIFIC WIRECENTER.  THE
PROMT FOR COSMOS IS THE WIRECENTER AND
A % SIGN.  IE: WC% WHERE WC IS THE WIRE
CENTER YOU ARE LOGGED IN AS.  IF YOU
DO HAPPEN TO GET AHOLD OF A LOGIN AND
PASSWORD, BUT THE SYSTEM STILL ASKS
FOR A WIRECENTER, THEN YOU CAN TELL
WHAT ARE VALID WIRECENTERS BY WHEN IT
ASKS FOR LOGIN & PASSWORD, THEN THE
WIRECENTER AND YOU ENTER A WRONG WC
THE SYSTEM WILL RESPOND WITH:

;LOGIN: PA52
PASSWORD:
WC?XX
WC??
INVALID LOGIN

IF YOU NOTICED, WC?? CAME AFTER THE
WIRECENTER, NOW IF YOU HAD A VALID
WC, IT WOULD JUST SAY INVALID LOGIN
AFTER THE WC WITHOUT THE WC??.  IE:

;LOGIN:PA52
PASSWORD:
WC?OA
INVALID LOGIN

THAT WOULD MEAN YOU HAVE THE CORRECT
WC, BUT INCORRECT PASSWORD.  IF ALL
GOES WELL YOU WILL GET OA% AS THE
PROMT FOR WHATEVER YOUR WC IS.

TRANSACTION CODES
----------- -----

COSMOS HAS A SET OF THREE LETTER
COMMANDS CALLED TRANSACTION CODES
WHICH TELL THE SYSTEM WHAT TO DO. THEY
ENABLE YOU TO VIEW, MODIFY, OR ADD
INFORMATION ABOUT TELEPHONE NUMBERS,
CLASS OF SERVICE, OPERATING EXCHANGES,
ETC.

HERE IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
MOST COMMONLY USED TRANSACTION CODES:

CAY - CREATE AN ASSEMBLY
CCA - CHANGE CUSTOMER ATTRIBUTES
DAY - DELETE AN ASSEMBLY
DRE - DENY AND RESTORE ESTABLISHMENT
FLR - FRAME LAYOUT REPORT
ISH - INQUIRE ABOUT A CIRUIT <-PHONE #
LOE - LIST ORIGINATING LINE EQUIPMENT
MAL - MANUAL ASSIGNMENT LIST
MAY - MODIFY AN ASSEBLY
MCH - MANUALLY CHANGE HUNT
MDC - MANUALLY DISCONNECT A CIRUIT
SCA - SERVICE ORDER COMPLECTION - AUTO
SIR - SORTING INQUIRY BY RANGE
SLC - SUBSCRIBER LINE COUNTS FOR
      CUSTOM CALLING FEATURES
USL - LIST USOC (US) FILE DATA
WCC - WIRE CENTER CHANGE

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A TRANSACTION,
USING ISH (INQUIRE ABOUT A CIRCUIT)
WHICH GIVES INFORMATION ABOUT A
TELEPHONE NUMBER.

WC% ISH
H TN 935-2481
_.

IT WILL THEN PRINT VARIOUS INFORMATION
ABOUT THE PHONE # 935-2481.  BUT IT IS
DOUBTFUL YOU WILL UNDERSTAND SINCE IT
IS ALL ABBREVIATED.  I WILL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING IN PART II.  AFTER PRINTING
THE INFO ABOUT THE #, COSMOS WILL SAY:
** ISH COMPLETED 20-JUN-84 **

WHEN USING CERTAIN COMMANDS, THERE ARE
VARIOUS LINES TO BE USED.  SOME ARE:
H-LINE --REQUIRED IN MOST TRANSACTIONS
FOR ORDER, INQUIRY, AND REPORT DATA.
I-LINE --TRANSACTION INVOLVES INWARD
MOVEMENT (IE: INSTALLING A PHONE).
O-LINE --TRANSACTION INVOLVES OUTWARE
MOVEMENT (IE: DISCONNECTING A PHONE).
R-LINE -- USED FOR MAKING REMARKS TO
SERVICE OR WORK ORDERS.  A H-LINE WAS
USED IN THIS EXAMPLE.
TO SIGNIFY THE END OF INPUT FOR MOST
COMMANDS TYPE "." W/OUT QUOTES.  YOU
USE A ";" TO SEPARATE CIRUITS, WHICH
IS GOOD WHEN YOU (OR THE PHONE CO.)
HAS TO ENTER MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INFO.


PREFIXES, FORMATS AND CODE VALUES:
--------- ------- --- ---- -------

COSMOS PROVIDES A LANGUAGE BY MEANS
OF WHICH THE USER CAN COMMUNICATE WITH
THE SYSTEM.  THE LANGUAGE INCLUDES
VARIOUS PREFIXES AS WELL AS INPUT
FORMATS AND INPUT VALUES.

PREFIXES ARE ABBREVIATIONS WHICH
REPRESENT SPECIFIC DATA CATEGORIES TO
THE SYSTEM WHEN INPUT BY THE USER. AN
EXAMPLE OF A PREFIX IS "TN" WHICH MEANS
"TELEPHONE NUMBER".  AN INPUT FORMAT
DEFINES THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS
FOLLOWING A PREFIX AS WELL AS THE
PATTERN IN WHICH THESE MUST BE ENTERED
FOR EXAMPLE, "TN XXX-XXXX" MEANS THAT
THE PREFIX "TN" MUST BE FOLLOWED BY
SEVEN CHARACTERS IN THE FORMAT SHOWN.

INPUT VALUES ARE THE ALLOWABLE DATA
ENTERED FOR EACH PREFIX IN THE CORRECT
INPUT FORMAT.  AS MENTIONED IN THE
PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH, THE INPUT FORMAT
FOR THE PREFIX "TN" IS "TN XXX-XXXX".
THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS (XXX) MUST
BE ALPHANUMERIC; THE LAST FOUR (XXXX)
MUST BE NUMERIC.  SO, COSMOS WOULD
CONSIDER AN INPUT OF "TN 935-2481" AS
VALID INPUT.  BUT YOU *MUST* USE THE
CORRECT WIRECENTER FOR THE (XXX) IN
QUESTION.  IN HACKING COSMOS PART II
I WILL HAVE A LIST OF THE MOST
COMMONLY USED PREFIXES, FORMATS AND
PREFIX CODE VALUES WHICH ENABLE YOU
TO READ AND UNDERSTAND COSMOS
TRANSACTIONS.


COSNIX
------

COSNIX IS A MUTATED VERSION OF COSMOS
AND UNIX BOTH WRITTEN BY BELL LABS.
COSNIX, IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM OF
THE COSMOS SYSTEM.

SYSTEM COMMANDS
------ --------

AS SOME OF YOU WILL NOTICE,IF YOU READ
THE BASICS OF HACKING II- VAX'S UNIX,
BY THE KNIGHTS OF SHADOW, ALOT OF THE
COMMANDS USED ON UNIX ARE ALSO USED
ON COSMOS.

COMMANDS ARE AS PHOLLOWS:

WHERE - GIVES LOCATION OF THE SYSTEM:
        THIS COMMAND CAN BE $VERY$
        USEFUL SINCE YOU CAN GO
        TRASHING AT THE LOCATION
        THAT THE CENTER IS AT.

WC% WHERE

COSMOS 5 <- OR WHATEVER # IT IS.

USING CONTROL-C WILL INTERUPT ANY
PROCESS YOU ARE EXECUTING AT THE TIME.
SOMETIMES YOU WILL HAVE TO ENTER IT
MORE THAN ONCE. CTRL-S PAUSES CTRL-Q
RESTARTS AND CTRL-Y LOGS YOU OFF.

THATS IT FOR PART I, IT SHOULD GIVE
YOU A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF COSMOS.
PART II WILL EXPLAIN THE PREFIXES SO
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INTERPRET ALOT OF
THE INFORMATION PRINTED BY COSMOS.
AND WILL EXPLAIN PATHS/FILES.

NOTE: Everything shown in UPPER CASE is printed by COSMOS or typed by you.

   I would like to correct a mistake I  made in Part 1, I got a little carried
away with the capabilties of COSMOS. You Cannot enter someones name and get 
thier phone #.  What COSMOS is primarily used for is: To assign Central Office
Equipment to cable pairs, and telephone numbers.  It maintains records of all
relevent facilities including subscriber cable and office equipment, process
service and work orders, and it produces bulk assignments for office additions
and rearrangements.  In short, it automates the frame in your Central Office.
It prints lists at the beggining of each day, telling what numbers to connect,
and disconnect.  Also, to keep track of everything going on in the frame.


HACKING ACCTS:
------- ------

Most COSMOS systems run on either a PDP 11/45 or 11/70 made by DEC, and can
usually handle up to 96 terminals which are either hard-wired, or remotly dial
into the system.  If you don't know your local COSMOS dial-up or don't have an
account you can probably bullshit 1  out of your Test Board, frame, or switch.
They all should have the Dial-up, password and WireCenter in your area.  Tell
them you are Joe Comosolo from the COSMOS data center and youv'e noticed
illegal access attempts. Ask them who is having the problem and ask them for an
account/password to do an on-line check to see what the problem is.


   Typical COSMOS accts are: MF02, PA52, DP08, etc.  Those 2 letter prefixes
in the beggining of the acct stand for:

PA- LooP Assignment center.
DA- Network Admin center.
RS- Repair Service.
MF- Frame and Toll.
FC- Frame Control center.
GA- General Inquiries.
DC- Data Conversion.
NT- NTec.
DP- DisPatch.
CI- CIC.

The more important accounts which are used for service order entry are, in
order of importance:

ROOT
SYS
BIN
PREOP
COSMOS

COSMOS is the account that the test board uses, and is now mainly found on the
older versions of the COSNIX operating  system.  The typical COSMOS passwords
are like:  WETEST, MILK48, RINGIT.  I have known people to guess a pass which
was a color or an anmimal then they entered other account names and  different
colors and got other pw's, but it is very unlikely that you will guess a pw.
Some accounts don't have passwords but  you will rarely get that lucky.
   Sometimes all you need is the dial-up to get in. Whoever was last on forgot
to hit CTRL-Y to log off, and just hung up, so when you call, you get the WC%
sitting there!  I hate to have to rely  on this method of entry, and prefer
having an account/password.  Well, you  are now in, and can do some of the 
things explained in this file.


TRANSACTION CODES:
----------- ------

  Once you log in you should get the prompt of WC% where WC is the Wire Center
and % indicates that the system is on-line.  From that prompt, you can type
certain commands that will enable you to do different things.  The ISH or INQ
commands (Inquire about a Circuit) will print out various information about the
number you do it to. From the prompt, type ISH or INQ <C/R>. You will then have
to type an H which means HUNT then TN which is the Telephone Number 935-2481
and the system will print an underscore "-".  You then type an "." and.........
WC% ISH
H TN 935-2481
-.

HUNT SEQUENCE FOR TN 935-2481
   TN 935-2482  TN 935-2484

** ISH COMPLETED 09-24-84

WC%

Here is an explanation of what was just printed out about the number 935-2481:

LINE 1 --> TN 935-2481
Is the Telephone number that you inquired about.

LINE 2 --> ST  WK PD    DATE 07-16-78   TYPE B
ST means STatus, WK PD is the WorK PerioD, the date following is when the TN
935-2481 was first installed, and TYPE  sometimes abbreviated as TT is the
Telephone number Type, where B is a POTs (Personal number) with Hunting. 
Hunting means that when the number 935-2481 is busy, the call will be forwarded
automatically to the next number until it finds an idle line.  The TT TYPE
could be any one of the following:

B  --  POTs hunting.
C  --  Coin.
G  --  Complex services, e.g., Direct
       Inward Dialing, Radio Common
       Carrier, etc.
O  --  Official (company).
Q  --  Centrex, WATS, large PBX's.
X  --  POTs non-hunting.


LINE 3 --> **ORD F24030161451   DD 01-20-84   FDD 01-20-84
ORD stands for service or work ORDer which has a maximum of 20 Alphanumeric
Characters.  DD is the Due Date, and FDD is the Frame Due Date, which I assume
is/was the last time the line was worked on.

LINE 4 --> OE  003-601-403
OE stands for Operating Exchange which, in this case is a #1ESS.  Check HACKING
COSMOS Part III for the formats of Operating Exchanges.  By seeing what format
the OE is, you can tell what type of CO the number is served by.

LINE 5 --> ST  WK PD   DATE 07-16-78  CS 1FR  US  1FR  FEA RNNL
ST, WK, PD were all explained in LINE 2, CS is the Customer Class of Service,
1FR stands for Flat Rate. US is the USOC (Uniform Service Order Code) which are
identification codes used on Service Orders and Equipment records to identify
items of service or equipment.  Each code conisists of 3 or 5 characters, each
one being either a letter or a number.  FEA RNNL stands for Customer FEAtures.
R = Rotary, N = Non-sleeve, N = Non-essential, and L = Loop started. The
typical type of line is Loop started, A ground start is used on PBX's and such.

LINE 6 --> (repeat of LINE 3)

LINE 7 --> LOC WC1014   LOC 213-03L14/4-04
LOC is the LOCation.

LINE 8 --> CP  45-1262
CP is the CablePair  45-1262.

LINES 9-11 --> (Have been previously explained.)

LINE 12 --> HUNT SEQUENCE FOR TN 935-2481
            TN 935-2482  TN 935-2484

As explained earlier, when 935-2481 is  busy, it will HUNT to 935-2482 if that
is busy, it will goto 2483 and so on.

You can also inquire upon the Cable Pair, by:

WC% ISH
H CP 45-1262
-.

The information printed will be similar to what was printed about the TN.


PATHS, FILES AND DIRECTORIES:
------ ----- --- ------------

If you have a semi-priveledged acct., type LS /* to see what files you have
access to. You will probably see something similar to:

/BIN:       /ETC:           /USR:
CP          COSNIX          BIN
DATE        INIT            COSMOS
ECHO        LINES           PREOP
LCASE       PASSWD          SO
MOTD        SYSGEN          SYS
STAT        UIDS            TMP

In actuality, these directories/files will be in "single file", I just put them
in 3 columns to save space/paper.

To run a program/process just type the  filename at the WC% promt.  If you want
to view a file in a directory, in this  case we will use the /BIN directory,
you would type:

WC% CD /BIN

You first Connect to the Directory then to print the file MOTD which stands for
Message Of The Day, type:

WC% PR /MOTD

FRI APR. 10, 1984  11:37:16 MOTD  PAGE 1

ATTN: ALL USERS
MAKE SURE YOU LOG OUT PROPERLY
THANK YOU

Some files may have an "!" appended to  the end of them on the older versions
of COSNIX, those files should be text files and you should have no problem
PRinting them.  Other files may be encrypted, or you mistook a file for a
program and all you get is garbage.

If you do not know what directory a file you are looking for is in use the 
FIND <file-name> command. As shown below, PERMIT is what we are looking for:

WC% FIND PERMIT
    /DEV/PERMIT

You can either connect to the /DEV directory then PRint the file or type:

WC% PR /DEV/PERMIT


The most looked up file would probably be the PASSWD file.

WC% CAT /ETC/PASSWD

ROOT:YXMDIMME:0::/:
SYS:YXORBMBX:1::/USR/SYS:
BIN:TMMZAKZF:3::/BIN:
PREOP::8::/USR/PREOP:
COSMOS:LEORVVB4:39::/USR/TMP:/BIN/PERMIT
PA02:ZSKD4ET:40::/USR/TMP:/BIN/PERMIT

99 times out of 100 the passwords will  be encrypted.  Notice that there are 2
colons after the PREOP account, that means that there is no password, so after
entering PREOP at the ;LOGIN: it will jump to WC? then if it is a valid WC, you
will get in.  The way COSMOS checks to  see if the pass is valid is: after you
enter your account, and password, the system encrypts the pw you just typed,and
compares it to the encrypted password in the PASSWD file. If it is correct, you
will be in, if not, INVALID LOGIN.


In Part 3 I will have the PREFIX, FORMATS AND CODE VALUES Chart which gives all
the needed definitions of the abbreviations that the system prints out when
performing most transactions.

                   ***************************************

Under COSMOS software version 8.X there are new input procedures for SOE's.
Although these are mostly in the area of error handling, they require a bit
of discussion, seperate from the basic input.

    Error Handling
    --------------
      Service order transactions interact with the user more frequently in
      REV 8.X.  Each time the transaction is ready for a new input, it will
      respond with and underscore "_" at the beginning of the new line.  This
      indicates that the preceding line is correct.
      If an error does occur, the transaction will respond with an error
      message and prompt for correction.  When an error occurs, you have
      4 choices.
      1.  Re-enter the entire field correctly.
      2.  Enter line-feed to ignore, (checks rest of line)

   H-LINE inputs.
   --------------
      H-LINE input for the service order trio SOE/CSA/TSA is being rigidly
defined in 8.0 according to three categories.  These categorys contain
fundamentally different types of order/facility information.
     Category 1: ORD, OT, DD, FDD,J OC, DT, SG, EO, LC
     Category 2: US, FEA, CCF, CAT, BTN, SS, AO, RZ, FR, GP/CG, CTX/CG/MG/NNX,
                 LDN, RTI.
     Category 3: FW, RW
     Category 1 items are primary, once defined they cannot be changed
                by conflicting category 2, and 3 lines.

SOE - Service Order Establishment
    - Establishes a pending service order.  The types of orders are; NC, CD,
      CH, F, T, SS, RS, R, RF.  Reassociations are treated as change orders.
    - H-lines must contain ORD, DD, and OT.  Optional facilities; FW, RW, FDD
      AO, FR, SG, and either DT or OC.
    - I and O lines may contain; US, FEA, CP, OE, TN, RZ, NNX, PL, TP, TK, BL, #     SE, CON, MR, BTN, RC, RE, RT,STC, STN, STO, CCF, LCC, and RTI.
    - ESS orders requiring coordination by the recent change input center may  #    be flagged with an input of "RW C".

TDZ - Telephone Number Assignments List
    - List the indicated number of spare directory numbers for a NNX code, and
      directory number type.
    - Up to 25 directory numbers can be specified, using the prefix LC.
Example
WC% TDZ
H NNX 534/TT G/LC 7    (LC can be up to 25)
.
Output example would look similar to this.

  AVAILABLE DIRECTORY NUMBERS (7)
534-XXXX
534-XXXX, etc.
**TRANSACTION COMPLETED

SOW - Service Order Withdraw
    - Withdraws most recent version of a service order
    - Order number must refer to the latest version.  The H-line circuit ID
      identifys the order.  Valid circuit identifiers are; TN, XN, PL, CP, OE,
      and TK.
Example

CDD - Change Due Date
    - Change due date of a service or frame order
    - I think an example will suffice;
WC% CDD
H ORD CH-XXXXXX/TN 534-1822
I DD 01-01-86
.
output example
**ORD CH-XXXXX  DUE DATE 01-01-86


NAI - Telephone Number Assignment Inquiry
    - Provides from 1 to 25 spare telephone numbers compatable with the
      input specifications.
    - Input is an H-line with the TN type and NNX or RZ entries. The status of
      the TN supplied will be modified to reserved if ST is specified on the H-#     line.
Example
WC% NAI
H TT X/NNX 534/ST RS
.
this shows first available spare in prefix 534.

MAP - Manual Assignment Parameter
    - Permits the PAO to establish the parameters that will constitute the PAO #     Open-of-Day report.
WC% MAP
