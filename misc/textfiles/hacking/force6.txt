There is more or less a solution to all of these problems:

      1> Great, you are in luck..If passwords start to die on you rather quick,
         Keep of the system for a month. They can't keep it up forever. Only
         login occasionally to a few accounts to see if steps 3-5 have been
         taken.  THIS IS IMPORTANT, YOU MUST CONTINUE TO CHECK AT LEAST FEW
         ACCOUNTS FOR FEW WEEKS.  This is where I stuffed it and lost virtually
         all accounts.
      2> Let them try, you should only be on the trojan for few seconds, just
         long enough to down load the passwords. If you are going via data
         networks or route your call, there is no way in the world they can
         trace you.  Just watch out for anything sus about the accuonts you use
         later on.
      3> If you have been monitoring the account well, simply beat the user to
         the message and delete it.
      4> Again, login before the user does and change the password first to
         something different and then to the original password. The user will
         be none the wiser.
      5> You are in deep shit...They are fighting dirty, so we retaliate.
         change all the passwords and abuse all the accounts to the utmost.
         ie run Sprinters simultaneously on ten accounts at a time and give
         em hell.  There are few tricks to physically destroy the data on
         the drives and crash the entire system, but that just shouldn't be
         attempted without a greater reason and I bet I can't trust all of
         you not to have a go at it, so suffer, you'll have to find out how
         for yourselves.

Happy Hunting!

DIALCOM PRIMOS COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Following is a simple rundown of a few most usefull commands:

A DIRECTORY.NAME      - attaches to a directory or another if high enough
                        access. Could have a format: ID DIRECTORY.NAME PASSWORD
                        if there are a number of dialcom systems at the one
                        site, it is often possible to attach to directories
                        outside your dialcom systems. To do that, just type
                        something like  A 09:DIRECTORY.NAME PASSWORD
                        This works quite well from most dialcoms with the
                        exception of system 07 and 09
PASSWD -LONG          - sets a remote access to the ID.  It means you can acces
s                        it from another ID.
WATCH ABC123          - Can monitor the actions of a user, ie Spy on him. This
                        one requires a higher access level.
F                     - Catalogs Drive
USERS                 - Shows number of users online, if a low number, best to
                        keep out, since you tend to stick out a lot if the
                        system is monitored from time to time.
SY                    - Status of users in a UFD series. A higher access is
                        needed for anything worthwhile.
ONLINE                - Shows user online, within a UFD series.

These are the basic commands one uses frequently for hacking and holding
onto an account.  For more information on commands, it's great if you can get
the manuals, if not, a number of good files have been written.

The commands do tend to be a little different in different primos versions.
Some systems are good enough to give you the master command file. The following
is a file found in most DIALCOM systems. MINERVA sys 07 and 09 excluded,
Naturally.
