                             Are You a Hacker?

        Take a little quiz for me today.  Tell me if you fit this
description.  You got your net account several months ago.  You have been
surfing the net, and you laugh at those media reports of the information
superhighway.  You have a red box, you don't have to pay for phone calls.
You have crackerjack, and you have run it on the password file at a unix
you got an account on.  Everyone at your school is impressed by your computer
knowledge, you are the one the teachers ask for help.  Does this sound
like you?  You are not a hacker.
        There are thousands of you out there.  You buy 2600 and you
ask questions.  You read phrack and you ask questions.  You join
#hack and you ask questions.  You ask all of these questions, and you
ask what is wrong with that?  After all, to be a hacker is to question
things, is it not?  But, you do not want knowledge.  You want answers.
You do not want to learn how things work.  You want answers.  You do not
want to explore.  All you want to know is the answer to your damn
questions.  You are not a hacker.
        Hacking is not about answers.  Hacking is about the path you
take to find the answers.  If you want help, don't ask for answers,
ask for a pointer to the path you need to take to find out those answers
for yourself.  Because it is not the people with the answers that are
the hackers, it is the people that are travelling along the path.
