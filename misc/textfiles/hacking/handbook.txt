                           WELCOME TO THE COMPLETE HANDBOOK OF HACKING CIS!

                          1.  Introduction.
Greetings all.  Before I begin, I would like to say a few words about my 
experience to write such a manual.
                              I recently leafed through several manuals of 
how to hack Compuserve.  As a hacker myself, and an abuser, I found the 
manuals no help at all to a veteran.  So I thought to myself:  Since ive 
been hacking Compuserve for 2 years now, why don't I write a complete novel 
for novices and veterans alike?  I decided to write this to completly cover 
every aspect of hacking compuserve.
                               It is a shame how just about everyone calls 
themselves a hacker.  I've seen some people completly botch up Compuserve 
hacking.  True, it is a tough service to hack, but is stupid.  CIS is so stup
id they put ziffnet on their service.  What is ziffnet?  Well, basically its a hackers haven.  This gives you compuserve accounts that will last 11 
ys!  Sign up 1 account every other day and use fake credit cards [if you do
nt know how to get them, call my bbs and ill tell you] and fake info for si-
gnup.  All you need is the latest sign up number.  If you are an advanced
 hacker, you should already know where to get it.  I will provide you with
 the current gateway to ziffnet later in the book. 
                                2. Beginning hacking tips

                                * You should have at least 1 month 
experience with Compuserve legally on a regular account.  This handbook will 
assume that you have a Compuserve account you have owned for at least 1 month.
                                 * Dont be a daredevil:  If you are new to 
hacking, do not attempt stunts like going to the cb forum and calling the 
sysop an asshole, or ordering 5 thousand dollars worth of merchandise from 
the electronic mall, or anything that could give you away.  If you do 
dangerous things, CIS may attempt to trace the call and get you in deep shit.
                                  * CIS is stupid.  Use it to your advantage.
                                  * Use the account in electronic mail, 
forums, and CB Simulator [see cb simulator chapter].  Do NOT use the mall.  
Anything else like stock quotes or phonefile is ok.
                                 3. Getting your first hack account
Now that you have been used to compuserve and know a little of hacking, I 
will tell you how to get your first hack account.  A word of caution on the 
cb simulator before i continue.. if you are going to use the cb, and have a 
regular account, do NOT use the same handle and do NOT go on your typical 
channel.  Thats asking for it.
                                 There is a surefire way to get free 
accounts.  You need to have about half an hour of free time to do this.  
Simply call the Compuserve Idiot Service customer service line at the number 
1-800-848-8990.  Make sure you get to speak with a representative.  DO NOT 
speak to the same one twice.  Now, choose one of these bullshit stories to 
tell the rep.
                               a. I got a modem for my birthday/conformation
etc, and I by mistake threw the CIS start up booklet away.  Can you give me 
a new sign up?
                               b. My serial number wont work on my account 
[give them fake sign up info like 177000,70 star-heart agreeement 177s948a 
serial # 1779027]
                                  The idiot at the other end will give you 
your first hacked account.  Keep in mind this account is real and will last 
11 days with a fake credit card number.
                                  There are other ways to get hacked 
accounts, which I will discuss with you later on.
                                  4. What to do on the account
You have a variety of things you may do on your new account.  Feel free to 
download software for 24 hours straight in a forum, leave horribly 
disgusting messages, send email to people you dont know, etc.  Always give 
fake information when asked.  And if you feel you are going to get caught, 
drop carrier and dont use the account again.  There are numerous ways to get 
an account on CIS, dont worry if you lose one.
                                   5.  Hacking someone elses account
This is not as easy as some people say it is.  There are some tricks to get 
peoples passwords, which I will tell you later on.  The general password 
order is WORD SYMBOL WORD, but some use WORD WORD SYMBOL like exhaleheart.  
The trick is not to try out random numbers, but trick them into giving you 
their password.
                                    There are some smart people on CIS who 
will never fall for these tricks, but you can count on one moron out of 10.  
To do these tricks you need a formal typing style to look official, 
[capitalize all letters, always add ' and , when needed, and capitalize 
Compuserve, Service, and anything else belonging to cis like CB Simulator] 
and a hacked account [perhaps the one you got from calling the dumb-as-shit 
customer reps].  Go onto the CB Simulator, invite people one at a time at 
random, or invite people from channel 2 without a [HELPER] in their handle.  
One good way is to monitor the channel, the people making stupid mistakes 
are new to compuserve, simply invite them and then try out these tricks.
                                   a. Tell them you are from Compuserve 
Security, and you need their password to check out their account for 
possible problems.  Make up bogus trash problems like their Electronic Mail 
box is not functioning right, they are getting overcharged, etc.  [NOTE:  I 
know they tell you NEVER give out your password to anyone when you first 
sign up.  Do you really believe anyone actually reads that shit? -:-)]
                                    b. Tell them you are conducting a 
research assignment, and need their password for this assignment.  If they 
ask, say you have CIS' permission and that you are collecting everyones 
password for a survey of popular passwords.  They'll believe it!
                                    Once you have the persons password, 
leave and change it immediately.  Then reek havoc on it.
                                    6. CB Simulator
This is advertised as a "warm, happy place where wonderful people meet and 
make friends".  Its 100% bullshit.  Half the people there are mentally ill, 
losers, retards, neurotics, men pretending to be girls, etc.  Another 
affliction here is stupidity.  This is where you can try out the tricks in 
chapter 5 above.  Here is where you will get other peoples passwords.  Watch 
the handles also.  A while ago 2 people from Germany logged on using their 
passwords as their handles!  [I told you they are stupid]
                                     7.  Electronic Terrorism
This is as far as I will go in this manual for hacking information for 
novices.  The rest of the book is for advanced hackers.  This is a novice 
electronic terrorism section which will explain how to terrorize the people 
you don't like on Compuserve.  
                                      The most important thing you can get 
on Compuserve, besides a user id, is a name.  Using that name, and where 
they are from [check the NODE, and write down the info given to you by cis] 
type /go phonefile and use the information to possibly obtain addresses and 
phone numbers for these people.  Using these, we can make an effective 
electronic mail message, like "Is this where you live [name]?  [give 
address] Well, im going to go fuck you up tomorrow.  See you later asshole"
                                      Using electronic mail, we can send the 
same message to the same people as many times as you wish.  On your hacked 
account, /go mail and select address book.  Select distribution list, and 
make one or two entitled whatever you want.  When it says member, put a 
non-swear in for the name each time, and same id for the address.  Do it 20 
times.  [NOTE:  Dont enter fuckface or asshole for member.  The system wont 
allow you to use that, use something like prick or cocksucker].  To 
accomplish this, make the threatening mail message, when it says Send to: 
enter the name of your distribution list.  That person recieved 20 messages, 
all the same. Repeat 5 more times and his/her box is jammed with 100 
messages!  [if you do it enough you will destroy his/her compuserve mailbox]
                                    That wraps up this section of the 
handbook for novices.  Using the tricks you now know, practice for a few 
months then read the next section.  Although I know that you will read it 
now anyway, I am saying this for your own sake.  If you do the following 
tricks with little experience you may get caught, and we don't want that 
right?
              
  
                                    8.  Second Introduction
This section of the Perfect Handbook to Hacking Compuserve is for anyone 
with a lot of experience with compuserve hacking.  I will provide you first 
with a list of useful information, and then we will discuss new ways to geta 
ccounts, what to do, and people to hurt.
                                    8.1 Useful Info List
73317,1777-User id of Nicholas Seraphin.  He is a 20 year old fat fuck and a 
snitch.  He deserves all the punishment he can get, like sending him 100 
mail messages.  Avoid him with a Ziffnet account or he will report you.
70006,522-User id of CB Manager *LooLoo*.  Very dangerous, avoid at all costs.
76702,643-User id of AX, the cb forum sysop and chief helper.  He has almost 
the same powers as LooLoo.
1-614-764-2302-LooLoos phone number [Leave her alone over cb, but show no 
mercy calling her up and belching, farting, anything annoying.  Shes not 
dangerous over the phone -:-)]
/go mail-gets you to CIS mail
/go cb-1-sends you to general cb band
/go phonefile-gets you to phone+address listing of members
/go directory-gets you user id numbers and names
                                     9. Ziffnet
CIS is stupid.  CIS is so stupid they put ziffnet on their service.  What is 
ziffnet?  Well, basically its a hackers haven.  This gives you compuserve 
accounts that will last 11 days!  Sign up 1 account every other day and use 
fake credit cards [if you dont know how to get them, call my bbs and ill 
tell you] and fake info for signup.  All you need is the latest sign up 
number.  If you are an advanced hacker, you should already know where to get 
it.  I will provide you with the current gateway to ziffnet and instructions 
on using accounts [current as of May 7,1993]
                                     User ID: any 177000 number
                                     Password: usually pcSYMBOLWORD
                                     Agreement: z11dand4numbers
To work on compuserve, sign it up, use fake info, and leave it alone for 24 
hours.  After that period you should be able to access compuserve.  If you 
can, immediately /go member, and choose cancel membership.  Press enter when 
it prompts for name, and choose 13 as reason for cancelling membership.  
Next day it should be cancelled, if it is, choose yes to reinstate it, enter 
the same fake credit card you entered before with same date, and itll let 
you on.  This will allow you to access cb simulator without getting your 
second password [if you used fake info, which you should, you wont be 
getting it anyway -:-)].  Give this new account to your friends also to hack 
and use.  Run up HUGE bills, stay in forums and download, etc.  Have fun!
                                     10. How to use ziffnets
You can use these accounts the same as regular sign up accounts from CIS, 
and terrorize people with them.  Like, remember our old friend Nick 
Seraphin?  Simply go mail and send him a bunch of messages saying fuck you.  
Terrorizing is fun and simple with these accounts, and you don't get caught 
if you play it safe.  CB Simulator is the place to go also, Nicks handle is 
*Eagle*, if you see him, tell him to go fuck himself.  Hes more of a snitch 
then a girl in kindergarten.  After 11 days, the account will die a natural 
death, and if you followed my advice, you should have more accounts to use.
                                     11. Advanced Terrorizing
You want to really get some people mad?  After hacking the account, go to a 
CIS forum and leave messages, saying the person has something free that 
relates to the forum name, and can be reached via email at his user id.  An 
example is going to the ham radio forum and leaving a message saying your 
friend has a radio show and would like to have an interview with some 
members of the forum live, and if interested please send mail to [enter his 
user id] and please send it email, dont leave it in the forum.  Do the same 
format in about 25 other forums, and the bastard will check his mailbox the 
next day to find 1,000 messages [to really piss him/her off, send 200 
messages using the techiniques i told you about in chapter 7.  If the 
bastard is nice, like Nick Seraphin, he/she will be replying to every 
message for the rest of the day! -:-)].  Blow the mailbox whenever you get a 
chance, once you have the persons mail box down a lot of vital information 
may be lost, like user ids in address book, PER area files, and real 
messages from friends.  It is important to some people, so just blow out the 
mailbox of an enemy whenever possible.  It really pisses him/off major.
                                    12. Snitches
No matter how good a hacker you are, you are likely to make mistakes.  Some 
mistakes are little, such as using a handle u used to use before on a 
regular account, then quickly changing it, but some mistakes can lead to 
problems.  There are several snitches on the Compuserve Idiot Service, and I 
will make you aware of who they are and what their ID is.  Feel free to use 
the techniques i've discussed in chapters 7 and 11.  [NOTE:  This applies to 
forums and cb simulator only]
                                    a. Nick Seraphin- You already know about 
him, but he has three accounts: 73317,1777, 70372,327, and 73540,555.
                                    b. Elizabeth Halat.  The user-ID for her 
is not known, however the handle she uses on cb is Rhiannon.  Be careful if 
you see that handle, or you may end up in deep shit with CIS.
                                    c. Any 7000 account.  Whether it is 
70006 or 70004, it is a CIS employee account.  They have the power to knock 
you off cis and suspend you, or possibly end your hacking career for good.  
Be wary of each account.  Ziffnets are easy to detect, since they all start 
with 71414, and every employee knows this.  However, sometimes on cb 
simulator general band on channel 17 their kids come on.  Nows your chance 
to maybe get the password trying out techniques used in chapter 5! -:-)
                                    d. Any [HELPER].  They know ziffnet and 
if you use your usual typing style, handle, and channel, then Im sorry, but 
you deserve to be caught.
                                    13. When you are caught
There is one effective technique to use when you are caught, IF you are 
caught.  Remember, if you used fake information, the morons cannot prove 
anything!  Simply deny the fuck out of whatever they say.  There are at 
least 1 million people in each state in the U.S, how would they be able to 
prove it's you?  Simple but effective.
                                    Another simple technique is to claim 
that someone is impersonating you.  Say the person has hacked your regular 
Compuserve account.  To prove it, occasionally call from wherever this 
person is from [example: texas, new york, oregon] using the access numbers 
that can be found in CIS.  If you wish to use one of the current numbers, 
simply /go help and choose option 9.  Write down the number and use it as a 
node.  This may be the thing that saves your ass if you are caught.  A note 
about this:  Keep the LD calls short.  You don't want a big bill, but you do 
want proof that "somebody else" is using your account.
                                    14. General Things to Keep in Mind
* CIS is not known for being smart.  However, they are not completly 
stupid.  They will catch you if you make big mistakes.
* The more experience on your regular account, the better.  You should 
always learn and gather information about what youa re hacking for maximum 
effeciency.
* Stay away from helpers, 7000 accounts, and anyone who seems overly 
interested in knowing your personal information.  If needed, drop carrier, 
and relog on half an hour later.
* Download as much as you want from the forums.  This is your chance to get 
the latest files for free.  NEVER upload, for your own safety.
* Use the techniques in chapters 7 and 11 on anybody who gives you a hard 
time over the cb simulator.
* Ziffnet accounts last 11 days when made.  If you hack someones account 
remember you are on borrowed time [and money] so do what you have to in the 
first 5 days and then have fun the remaining time.
* Never get any CIS employee extremly upset at you.  The best solution is to 
simply piss off the forum managers with dumb messages or obscene messages 
directed to other users.
* When in doubt of what to do, call my BBS [shameful plug -:-)]
                                  That about wraps it up for the Handbook of 
Hacking Compuserve.  In the future expect more updates and information as 
CIS changes to attempt to keep us hackers out.  They'll never be able to 
obviously.  A few final words:  Everything I have said here works.  The 
information given is current and accurate, and if followed I see no reason 
you cannot continue hackin successfully.  Watch yourself, and you can have a 
lot of fun driving the assholes over in CIS crazy.
                                  Happy Hacking!!
