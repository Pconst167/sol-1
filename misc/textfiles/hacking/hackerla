LAWS OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
----------------------------
1> There is always one more bug.
2> Any given program, when running, is
    obsolete
3> If a program is useless, it will
    have to be documented.
4> If a program is useful, it will
    have to be changed.
5> Any program will expand to fill all
    available memory.
6> The value of a program is
    proportional to the weight of its
    output.
7> Program complexity grows until it
    exceeds the capability of the
    programmer to maintain it.
8> Make it possible for programmers to
    write in English and you will find
    out that programmers cannot write
    in English.
 
WEINBERG'S LAW
--------------
 If builders built buildings the way
programmers wrote programs, then the
first woodpecker that came along would
destroy civilization.
 
HARE'S LAW OF LARGE PROGRAMS
----------------------------
 Inside every large program is a small
program struggling to get out.
 
TROUTMAN'S PROGRAMMING LAWS
---------------------------
1> If a test installation functions
    subsequent systems will
    malfunction.
2> Not until a program has been in
    production for at least six months
    will the most harmful error then
    be discovered.
3> Job control cards that cannot be
    arranged in improper order will
    be.
4> Interchangeable tapes won't
5> If the input editor has been
    designed to reject all bad input,
    an ingenious idiot will discover a
    method to get bad data past it.
6> Machines work, people should think.
 
GOLUB'S LAWS OF COMPUTERDOM
---------------------------
1> A carelessly planned project takes
    three times longer to complete
    than expected; a carefully planned
    project will take only twice as
    long.
2> The effort required to correct the
    error increases geometrically with
    time.
 
BRADLEY'S BROMIDE
-----------------
 If computers get too powerful, we can
organize them into a committee - -
that will do them in.
                                                                                -----------------------------------:>
