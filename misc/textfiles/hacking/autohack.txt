First, a general overview of AutoHack.  It contains two basic programs in
one.  A Scanner, which will scan through a set range of numbers and check for
carriers, and a Hacker, which will "hack" through codes on a given Long 
Distance service, such as MCI, Sprint, Metrophone, or Allnet.

=================
 Hacking Section
=================

The hacking section options consist of two subchoices, Begin, and Reconfigure.
We will start with Reconfigure.

Reconfigure allows you to change virtually every parameter in AutoHack Hacking
Section.  Here is a brief explaination of all of them.

COM port.............The COM port that your modem is in.  Can only be 1 or 2
Hack port............The telephone number of the Long Distance service you wish
                     to hack on.
Start code...........The code to start hacking with.
Increment............Allows you to set it to add a certain number to the code
                     to try each time.  If 0 is selected, it will be a totally
                     random code, and if 99 is selected it will increment the
                     code with a random number between 1 and 10.
Time.................The number of minutes you want the hacker to run
Opening delay........The number of seconds you want to wait after the Hack 
                     port is dialed, before the code/number is dialed.
Wait carrier delay...The number of seconds you want to wait for a carrier after
                     the dialing process begins (includes dialing time)
Length of code.......The number of digits in the code
Number of carrier....A telephone number to try that ALWAYS gives a carrier.
                     It is a good idea to use one out of your own free-calling
                     area 

When you have reconfigured it to your needs, hit [Q] [RETURN] to quit.  This
will save the configuration so you will not need to reconfigure again the next
time you run AutoHack.

Now, you select "Begin Hacking" from the Hacking menu, and the process will
begin.  If you wish to stop the hacker completely, hit [X].  If you wish to
hide the screen, press [H].  Hiding the screen will put a fake screen over top
with the words " The Genius Compiler " on the screen, and false compiling
messages on the screen.  When the hack is finished, if the screen is still
hidded, it will display some status.  The status "Error:" is the number of
working codes you have gotten.  Pressing any key will return to the main
Hack menu.

If you are in "Hide" mode, [H] will return you to the normal screen, and [X]
will still quit.
 
==================
 Scanning section
==================

The Scanner also has a reconfigure screen.  These are the options it has:

LD Prefix.......The Long Distance prefix to dial before dialing the number to
                check for carrier.  This allows you to Scan a long distance
                area with MCI, Sprint, Metro, or another service, rather than
                paying with AT & T.  To Scan numbers within your free-calling
                area, type [/] at the prompt to change it and it will become
                blank.
Area code.......This is the area code of the numbers to be Scanned.  If the
                LD Prefix is blank, however, this is ignored.
Prefix..........This is the three digit prefix to the numbers to be Scanned.
Start number....This is the first of the four digit numbers to be scanned.
                (xxx/xxx-nnnn <- nnnn represents the start number)
End number......This is the last number to be Scanned (see Start number) 
Delay...........This is the number of seconds to wait for a carrier at a given
                Scanned number.

When you are finished, press [Q] [RETURN].  Notice that these options, too,
are saved so they do not need to be configured each time.

When you begin, it will scan the numbers you have specified.  You may press [X]
to abort.  Since this is not an illegal activity, I have found no reason to 
put the Hide Screen option in this section.

=====================
 Reading the results
=====================

When a Hack or a Scan is finished, the results will be in a file on the disk
called "Codes.Dat" (for the Hacker) or "Scanner.Dat" (for the Scanner).  These
files may then be printed out or just "Typed" on the screen from DOS.

NOTE: Be sure to print these files, or rename them, before beginning another
      Hack or Scan, otherwise they will be overwritten.. I.E.. Poof!
