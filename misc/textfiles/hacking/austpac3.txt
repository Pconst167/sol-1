                             Negative Energy.
Introduction
------------
The AUSTPAC data service which uses packet switching techniques has been
introduced by Telecom to meet the needs of customers who may have the
following computer networking requirements:
     o    the transmission of small volumes of data.
     o    data communication over long distances.
     o    infrequent data transfer or
     o    the need for a switching capability between different terminals
          and/or data bases.
This file outlines the component prices of AUSTPAC which will enable you to
determine the costs you would incur when using this service.
To assist you in understanding the AUSTPAC service and its facilities, we
recommend that this pricing file is read in conjunction with the following
Telecom publications which are freely available from your Capital City Data
Office: (Files Comming Soon)
     o    AUSTPAC GENERAL INFORMATION BROCHURE.
      and
     o    AUSTPAC FACILITIES BOOKLET.
AUSTPAC charging principles
---------------------------
AUSTPAC charges are made up of three seperate components:
     o    An ACCESS charge which in the case of dedicated access includes the
          provision of a Modem/Network Terminating Unit (NTU) and line. This
          charge is independent of the distance between your terminal and the
          nearest entry point into the packet switched network.
     o    A USAGE charge which is distance independent.
     o    An additional/optional FACILITIES charge.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
There is no charge for a call attempt if failure is due to the network. Calls
that are chargeable incur a minimum volume charge of 20 segments (50 segments
if Fast Select) and appropriate duration charges.
(i)    Rates: Standard rates apply to volume and duration between 8am and
       6pm, Monday to Friday. Off-peak rates apply at other times and
       National Public Holidays.
(ii)   Traffic volume is expressed in terms of kilosegments. A segment
       contains up to 64 octets (1 octet equals 8 bits). A packet (1024 bit
       max.) contains 1 segment (0-64 octets) or 2 segments (65-128 octets).
       A kilosegment, therefore, may be up to 512,000 bits.
(iii)  Acceptance of a user application for inclusion in a Close User Group
       is dependent on consent being given by the `owner` of the Group.
(iv)   Logical Channels (LC) and PVCs are numbered in sequence whereby PVCs,
       if any, have the lowest numbers in the sequence commencing at number
       1. (eg. PVC#1, PVC#2, LC#3, LC#4).
CALCULATION OF USAGE CHARGES
----------------------------
Costs are calculated by converting an average call into its component elements
and applying typical volume and connect time allowances for each element. The
component elements of some typical calls are listed below:

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
-----------------
Asynchronous Transmission (Start/Stop)
======================================
In an asynchronous transmission system each character is preceded by a start
bit and concluded by one or more stop bits acting as an end of character
(Character Stop) indication.
Character-Mode Terminal
=======================
A terminal which receives and transmits characters one after another in the
stop start mode. AUSTPAC supports character mode terminals using the IA5
code.
Low Speed Computer Port (LSCP)
==============================
An access line to a computer or front-end processor requiring up to 8
asynchronous network access lines operating at the same data rate and with
one network address. Low speed computer ports may not be used for outgoing
AUSTPAC calls.
Network User Identifier (NUI)
=============================
Use for security, accounting and network information purposes. A NUI is only
submitted by a character mode terminal (X.28) gaining access to AUSTPAC via
the PSTN.
Packet-Mode Terminal
====================
A data terminal equipment which can control and format packets, and transmit
and receive packets.
Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)
===============================
A user facility, in which a permanent association exists between two
terminals, that is identical to the data transfer phase of a virtual call.
Private Port
============
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) access other than by common AUSTPAC
access numbers. Calls to private ports may result in a virtual call being set
up automatically to the preregistered address of the Private Port `owner`.
PSTN
====
Public Switched Telephone Network.
Synchronous Transmission
========================
In this type of transmission, process synchronisation is maintained, i.e. the
receiver is kept continuously in step with the transmitter throughout the
transmission by electronic clocking devices.
Virtual Call
============
A user facility in which a call set-up procedure and a call clearing
procedure will determine a period of communication between two terminals in
which user's data will be transferred through the network in the packet mode
of operation. All the user's data is delivered from the network in the same
order in which it is received by the network.
