NOTE: This file was originally to be released under RL but due to certian 
      circumstances both personal and external, it was never released.  I 
      have gone through it as of late and added a few addtions here.. spelling
      corrections there... and so on.  This file will now be re-released under 
      RDT.  




INTRODUCTION:

     With the onslaught of On-line Databases into the public and
private sectors, I feel it is becoming increasingly important to
penetrate and maintain access to these databases.  The databases
in question contain data pertaing to our personal lives and to our
enviornment.  Not to mention the tetrabytes of useful information
that can be directed toward research and personal education.


     Who or What is DIALOG?

     The DIALOG Information Network is a service that links
various Public and Commercial databases together for convience.
In the past, when one wanted to access LEGAL RESOURCE INDEX, for
instance, one would have to dial direct.  With DIALOG, Hundreds of
databases are connected via X25 networks(Tymnet, Sprintnet, Uninet,
Dialnet...) eliminating frustrating searching and outrageous long
distance telephone bills.(This is pre-ma bell breakup.)

     Further within the file is a PARTIAL list of databases found
online.  Some of the database are nothing more that peroidical's
and abstract sources, while others provide fulltext articles and
books.  There are over 2500 periodicals, newspapers, newsletters
and newswires online in Fulltext.

 Here are a few of my favorites:

Mc Graw-Hill Publications Online (File624)

     - Services offer FullText of their Newsletters serving the
Worldwide AeroSpace and Defense Industry.  Complete Text from 30
newsletters such as AeroSpace Daily, BYTE, Avation Week and Space
Technology, Data Communications, ENR, among others.  For more info
on the database, when in DIALOG type Help News624.

PR NEWSWIRE (File613)

     - PR Newswire records contain the complete text of news
releases prepared by: companies; public relations agencies; trade
associations; city, state,federal and non-US Government agencies;
and other sources covering the entire spectrum of news.  The
complete text of a news release typically contains details or
background information that is not published in newspapers.  More
than 8500 companies contribute news for PR Newswire.  PR NEWSWIRE
is a known agent of Corporate Intelligence.

DMS/FI MARKET INTELLIGENCE REPORTS (File589)

     - FullText of World AreoSpace Weekly, covers all aspects of
       both civil and military aerospace activities worldwide.
     - World Weapons Review, very high degree of technical detail
       and perspective.  As such, it has special appeal to military
       professionals and users of weapons.

  Note:  The database treats the newsletters as seperate Binders.
         For example, to access the World Weapons Review, after
         connecting to the database type:
              SELECT BN=WORLD WEAPONS REVIEW
              or whichever newsletter you wish to search.

FINE CHEMICALS DATABASE (File360)

     - The focus of this database is on sources for laboratory,
specialty, and unusual chemicals used in scientific research and
new product development.  Fine chemicals are relatively pure
chemicals typically produced in small quantities.  The database
will provide you with manufacturers and/or distributors.

DUN'S ELECTRONIC YELLOW PAGES (File515)

     - Largest database of U.S. Businesses available on DIALOG,
providing informaion on a total of 8.5 million establishments.
Corporate Intelligence:  you can quickly verigy the existence of a
business. Then you can obtain address, telephone number, employee
size, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and other basic
information.

CURRENT CONTENTS SEARCH (File440)

     - FullText articles from over 8000+ worldwide journals
dealing with Science and Technology.

BOOKS IN PRINT (File470)

     - access to in-print and out-of-print books since 1979, BIP lets
you retrieve bibliographic data on virtually every book published
or distributed in the united states.  Plus FullText reviews on the
book(s) you have selected.  See next.

PUBLISHERS DISTRIBUTORS AND WHOLESALERS ONLINE (File450)

     - PDW online will locate virtually any book, audiocassette,
software publisher, distributor or wholesaler in the U.S.


     You now should have an Idea of the power and scope of the
Dialog Information Network.  Please, read on.

NOTE:  Most of DIALOG's Services are now available to certain Research
       facilities, public and private, on CD-ROM.  Check your local Public
       and University libraries for this service.  Of course MANY of the
       more interesting databases are not available on CD-ROM and must 
       still be accessed through the DIALOG network.


                   Access to DIALOG Services

     The following online services are available from DIALOG 
Information Services:
              DIALOG
              DIALOG Business (DBC)
              DIALOG Medical Connection (DMC)
              DIALMAIL
              KNOWLEDGE INDEX

     The logon procedures for the first four are identical and use 
the same service address;  procedures for KNOWLEDGE INDEX differ 
only in the use of the KI service address, as illustrated 
throughout this file.

     The most common method of access to DIALOG services uses 
local phone numbers for three telecommunication networks: DIALOG's 
DIALNET, BT Tymnet, TYMNET, and SprintNet.  For those who live in 
an area that lacks a local dialup for those three networks, you 
may use the 800 link into the DIALNET for access to all DIALOG 
services except KNOWLEDGE INDEX.  This Access is not free, but it 
may cost less than dialing long-distance to reach a network node 
if you live in a region without local access.  Access ia also 
available through gateways from other online systems.

     Access to many DIALOG services is available from countries 
throughout the world and may be accessed from their own Public 
Data Networks.

Dialnet 800-Number Access

The two DIALNET 800 numbers are available for connecting to Dialog 
services from anywhere in the 48 contiguous states.  Access 
through these numbers is not free.

     (800)DIALNET     300, 1200, and 2400 b. (w/MNP error 
                      Checking)
     (800)342-5638

     (800)847-1620    VADIC 3400 series modems (1200 baud)
                      BELL 103 modems (300 baud)
                      BELL 212 modems (1200 baud)

Note:  I have excluded all the Dialup numbers for Tymnet and 
       Sprintnet.  If you don't know how to find those, obtain
       a file on X25 nets and Im sure they will be listed some-
       where in them.

           Logging in to DIALOG or KNOWLEDGE INDEX (KI)

     After dialing the appropriate number and establishing the 
connection, you must allow a 10-second delay and then enter the 
letter A (or a carriage return or another terminal identifier from 
the table below) before any further response will occur.  Then 
follow the remainder of the procedures show below.

NOTE:  I have researched the method of user Number and Password distribution
       and all User Number's and Passwords are generated by Dialog, BUT upon
       recieving a password from dialog you may opt to change it.  The 
       passwords issued from dialog are 8 digits long, consisting of random
       alpha-numeric characters.  


Once you are connected to your default service or file in DIALOG, 
you can then BEGIN one of the other services; for example, to 
access DIALMAIL, BEGIN MAIL.

- For access in half duplex, enter a < CTRL H > after the "Enter 
  Service:" prompt and before entering the word "dialog" or "ki."

- Dont hit backspace if you make an error in typing "dialog" or 
  "ki".  The result will be toggling your duplex, reason being
  your backspace is usually configured to send a < CTRL H > to
  delete to the left of the cursor one space.

                      Navigating in DIALOG


 To begin a search, one would enter:

              BEGIN xxxx

xxxx would be the database file number.  All Databases found on 
DIALOG are assigned file numbers.  The Searching Protocol used to
manipulate DIALOG seems at times to be a language in itself.  But 
it can be easily learned and mastered.


                       DIALOG HOMEBASE

     I would advise the first timer to jump into the DIALOG 
Homebase Menu, which provides information, help, file of the 
month, database info and rates, the DIALINDEX, DIALOG Training, 
and announcements.  DIALOG also provides subscribers with special
services which include Dialouts for certain Area codes.
You can begin the DIALOG HOMBASE by typing:

              BEGIN HOME

     Before I continue describing the various methods of 
searching, DIALOG has an online master index to the DIALOG 
databases, DIALINDEX (file 411).  It is a collection of the file 
indexes of most DIALOG databases (menu-driven databases cannot be 
searched in DIALINDEX).  DIALINDEX can be used to determine the 
number of relevant records for a single query in a collection of 
files.  The query can be a single term, a mulitple-word phrase, a 
prefix-coded field, or a full logical expression of up to 240 
characters.  Nested terminology, proximity operators, and 
truncated terms may also be used.

     You can set the files you want searched by using the SET FILE 
command.  Like this:

              BEGIN 411 (return)

              SET FILE ALLNEWS (if you want the latest news on 
                    or          hack/phreak busts)
              SF ALLNEWS

     Once you have selected a database you can now SELECT the 
search Keyword.  You set the flag by:

SELECT term       -  Retrieves a set of records containing the 
                     term.
                     May be used with words, prefix or suffix 
                     codes, EXPAND, or set numbers.

     When defining what you are searching for you can use Logical 
operators.  Such as,
     OR - puts the retrieval of all search terms into one set, 
          eliminating duplicate records.

    AND - retrieves the intersection, or overlap, of the search 
          terms: all terms must be in each record retrieved.

    NOT - eliminates search term (or group of search terms) 
          following it from other search term(s).

     Note: Always enter a space on either side of a logical 
           operator.

     SELECT Examples:

     SELECT (BICMOS OR CMOS) AND SRAM
                 or
     S (BICMOS OR CMOS) AND SRAM

- this would generate something like this:
              138 BICMOS <- records containing BICOMS only
             1378 CMOS   <- records containing CMOS only
              681 SRAM   <- records containing SRAM only
       S1     203 (BICMOS OR CMOS) AND SRAM <- this is what you 
       ^^                                      wanted.
       || Dialog names your select topic S1, S2... respectivly as 
          search its databases to make it easier to type. The 
          contents of S1 are 203 found records containing the key- 
          words BICMOS, CMOS, and SRAM.
          Sometimes S1 is refered to as S(tep) 1

PROXIMITY OPERATORS (Select command)

 (W) Requests terms be adjacent to eachother and in order 
     specified.                   -> S SOLAR(W)ENERGY
(nW) Requests terms be within (n) words of each other and in order 
     specified.                   -> S SOLAR(3W)ENERGY
 (N) Requests terms be adjacent but in any order.  Useful for 
     retrieving identical terms.  -> S SOLAR(N)ENERGY
(nN) Requests terms be within (n) words of each other and in any 
     order.                       -> S SOLAR(3N)ENERGY
 (F) Requests terms be in same field of same record, in any order.
                                  -> S SOLAR(F)ENERGY
 (L) Requests terms be in same descriptor unit as defined by 
     database.                    -> S SOLAR(L)ENERGY
 (S) Requests terms be in same Subfield unit as defined by 
     database.                    -> S SOLAR(S)ENERGY
 (C) Equivalent to logic operator AND.
                                  -> S SOLAR(C)ENERGY

PRIORITY OF EXECUTION

              Proximity operator, NOT, AND, OR

 Use parentheses to specify different order of execution, e.g. 
 SELECT (SOLAR OR SUN) AND (ENERGY OR HEAT).  Terms within 
 parentheses are executed first.

STOP WORDS (predifined)

 The following words may not be SELECTed as individual terms.  The 
computer will retrieve a set with zero results.  They may only be 
replaced with proximity operators, e.g. S GONE(2W)WIND

                   AN       FOR       THE
                   AND      FROM      TO
                   BY       OF        WITH

RESERVED WORDS AND SYMBOLS

The following words and symbols must be enclosed in quotation 
marks whenever they are SELECTed as or within search terms, e.g., 
SELECT "OR"(W)GATE?

              AND         =
              FROM        *
              NOT         +
              OR          :
              STEPS       /

TRUNCATION

                specified, use T to view next record.
                May also be used with specific accession number.

 Examples:    T 12/3/1-22    <- set/format/range
              T 8/7          <- set/format
              T 6            <- view next.(6 in this case)
              T 438721       <- view record 438721


DISPLAY         Provides display of results one screen at a time. Use 
D               PAGE for subsequent screens.
                Specify set/format/range of items.  If range not 
                specified, use D to view next record.  May also be used 
                with specific accession number.

 Examples:    D 11/6/1-44     <- set/format/range
              D 9/5           <- set/format

     Enjoy the DIALOG Information Network.  I found it most 
interesting.  This service is a MUST if in college or if you just 
love to learn as much as time permits.  It is a proven research tool 
used by R&D and University Facilities around the World.  As well 
as a refined Corporate Intelligence Information gathering tool.
Kept hidden from the general public by sheer expense and 'psudo- 
complexity'.  Enjoy.
