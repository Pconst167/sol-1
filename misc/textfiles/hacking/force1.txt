Welcome To the FORCE FILES From the Depths of The Realm. What is THE REALM you
may ask?  Well, just one of the boards I have sysoped, this one was (OR IS,
WHO KNOWS) an International BBS with an interesting collection of people.
Anyway,  I am about to retire for a while from the world of hacking and the
following is a basic summary of well over five years of work. (Well, perhaps I
won't retire, just evolve into the next stage hehehe). I hope this will make it
easier for the people to come and I hope they will add their acquired knowldge.
First of all I would like to thank:

THUNDERBIRD 1                    THE WIZARD                       THE TRADER

And all those who from the begining battled the security of the first
analogue computers and passed on their knowldge.

The files are broken up into several volumes, covering the following:

=========================================

Once upon a time, the old OZ phreakes used their tones on New Zealands lines,
to phreak around the world, but with the increasing prices of overseas
telecomunications the PUBLIC DATA NETWORKS or PACKET SWITCHING NETWORKS have
been one of the most usefulls tools at the hackers disposal.  Australia has
two major networks. AUSTPAC operated by telecom and very slack, and not so
slack MIDAS, run by the OTC.

A U S T P A C    5052
======================

Communicationg via Austpac or Midas for that matter can be a very costly hobby,
unless one has NUI or Network User Identification, which lives on someone
elses bank accoount. (Think of it as helping the Australian Economy if you
have any guilt feelings).  The Austpac NUI's a virtually impossible to
hack using any sprinting or scaning procedure. (If you don't believe me,
have a go at it, if you have fifty or so years to dedicate to it), but they
do happen to leak out from time to time. a Typical austpac NUI has the
following format:

                     BHPLIBJ9ADF3

where the first six digits are the user supplied id code, ie BHPLIB in this
case the NUI used to belong to the BHP LIBRARY. The last six digits are the
telecom supplied part for security. One important thing to note is that when
a NUI dies, only the last six digits are changed.  Don't take my word for it
since I haven't been able to verify this personally, but it makes sense and
the rumours are there.

Once you get the familiar AUSTPAC responce when you call up the system,
you have a number of options.

  1> - You connect to a system which will take collect calls, in which case,
       you don't need a nui. The format is just
             ?<NUA>      where NUA stands for Network User Address
       ie    ?222321000
       The NUA's a usually 9 characters long, but they can have two trailing
       digits to identify the specific system requested to the host.
       ie    ?222321000   will give one system
             ?22232100001 will give a different system at the same site
                          if appropriate.

   2> - If you have a NUI, you can then connect to virtually thousands of
        systems all over the world. You can connect directly to any network
        which Austpac will support. If a network is not supported like in the
        case of DIALNET, you must find an alternate route. For example to
        excess DIALNET, you need to go via a DIALCOM system or any other
        system which has a contract to carry data between the network and
        itself.   (I'll explain more about it later on) to connect to a
        system in the USA for example the format would be
                     ?N<NUI>-<NUA>
              ie     ?NBHPLIBJ9ADF3-0311041500101
        The 'N' tells austpac that a NUI is to follow and to take the
        necassary measures.

Austpac, like most other networks not only have a numerical address for each
host system, but has an equivalent alphabetical code, to simplify the task
of memorising the system addresses. For example:   ?236620000
                will do exactly the same job as:   ?.memo
In both cases you will be connected to TELECOM's TELEMEMO  a mail system
developed by the BELL LABORATORIES I believe, but quite useless when
compared to the more sophisticated ITT DIALCOM's network, of which MINERVA
is but one. (Refer to the DIALCOM NETWORK later on)

Host systems on AUSTPAC can be accessed not only via the AUSTPAC PAD,
(Packet Assembly, Dissasembly), but through otther networks internationally.
The international Code or DNIC for AUSTPAC is 5052 so to connect to TELEMEMO
from lets say BERMUDANET, one would type the NUA with the 5052 prefix
in front of it.  Almost all networks also require a ZERO to be put infront
of the DNIC and NUA to indicate an international connection.


M I D A S   5053
----------------
Midas is fundementally very simmilar to AUSTPAC, but there are many very
significant differences. First of all the NUI's are only six digits long.
This still gives a very large number of possibilities, however sprinting
NUI's now becomes slightly closer to reality.
There isn't a great deal which is different about Midas, but it has the
advantage of connecting directly with another networks PAD. ie by
connecting to the DNIC on networks where it is possible you will be
connected to the actuall PORT or PAD of the foreign network. With Austpac
this is possible only with TYMNET 03106, and few smaller US networks like
COMPUSERVE etc.
MIDAS unike Austpac at least has the decency to give a prompt '*' and the
format for connections is simmilar.  Example:
                                             *N<NUI>-<NUA>
                                      ie:    *NH7SVCO-03106001572

SOME TECHNICAL JUNK ON NETWORKS
--------------------------------

I will not go into any great detail on how the packet switching networks
works, but it's worth noting that it's a very clumsy system to use all
because it's cost effitient.  The Network PORT receives data from your
terminal at your speed be it 300, 1200, etc, or 9600 if you are fortunate
enough to have a dedicated connection. The Network receives the data and
compiles it into a small packet of data. It put's an address tag on it and
sends it off. It's bounced by few satellites etc and the system at the other
end does the rest. It reads the address tag and delivers it to one of it's
local systems at the speed at which it can be digested. As you can imagine,
this can get very slow and clumsy over long distances and the only reason
that it's done is they can neatly fit few thousand users on the one trunk,
whizing individual packets back and forth. About 50% of networks transmit
packets at 9600 baud the rest have operating speeds of over 15000 baud.

SYSTEM CRUNCHER has done a great job in his Austpac Tutorial, and me being
as lazy as I am, cant be bothered typing the info out again, so here
is an extract from the file dealing with Error codes and Profiles.
They can be used in reference to most other networks ie MIDAS since it is
a more or less universal standard.

                         AUSTPAC PAD PROFILES

     A  profile is a snapshot of all of the current values of PAD
     parameters.  A  profile is set for each  C-DTE.  A  standard
     profile  is  is  a given pre-defined set  of  PAD  parameter
     values which may correspond to a specific terminal or family
     of   terminals   to   an   application  or   a   family   of
     applications.There are 13 standard profiles.

     PARAMETER VALUES IN EACH STANDARD PROFILE


     PROFILE EXPLANATIONS

  0 :  Simple  profile defined in CCITT Rec X.28; echo by PAD; NO
       padding  after <CR> or <LF>;  NO idle  timer  delay.  PSTN
       customers  operating  at  up to 300 BPS or  1200  BPS  are
       usually assigned this profile.

  1 :  Transparent  profile  defined in CCITT Rec X.28;  suitible
       for low speed computer port (LSCP)

  2 :  Profile suitible for LSCP.Note that this is the only  LSCP
       profile which incorporates flow control by the PAD.
       (Parameter 5 = 1)

  3 :  Profile  recommended for C-DTE  communicating with another
       C-DTE  or with an LSCP.  There is an idle timer  delay  to
       allow  data  to  be sent from an  auxiliary  device.  This
       profile  is  also  suitible for  certain  terminals  which
       transmit in blocks.

  4 :  Same  as profile 3 except  for a shorter idle timer  delay
       and four padding characters after <CR>.

  5 :  Classic keyboard-printer terminal used for local printing.

  6 :  Same as  simple profile  (0) except for the procedures  on
       BREAK.

  7 :  The  only  data forwarding conditions here  are  <CR>  and
       BREAK;therefore   with   this  profile   complete   packet
       sequences  can represent logical entities  manipulated  by
       the application.

  8 :  Profile with  only <CR> as  data forwarding  character,  7
       padding  characters after <CR> to C-DTE,  and line folding
       by the PAD after 72 character line.

  9 :  Profile which is  used for  access by  videotex  terminals
       (1200/75 BPS)

       Note  : Profile 9  has been changed  from that  previously
               published  and  is now only accessible to  1200/75
               BPS users.

  10:  Profile  which  utilizes "Editing  during  data  transfer"
       (Parameter  15  = 1) and employs <LF> as  a  line  display
       character (Parameter 18 = 10)

  11:  This  profile  could be used  instead of profile 2 for  an
       LSCP  without  flow  control by the  PAD  when  a  shorter
       transmission delay is required.

  12:  Same  as profile 0  except for parameter 2,  for terminals
       not needing echo by the PAD.

  Format to set PAD :
  SET <PAD#>:<VALUE><CR>

  AUSTPAC MESSAGES - EXPLANATION

  CLR OCC  :   The called  party is  engadged in other calls  and
               unable to accept the incoming call

  CLR INV  :   Invalid  facility requested  by calling  DTE.  Eg:
               Invalid NUI.

  CLR RNA  :   The called party does not accept reverse charging.

  CLR NC   :   A temporary network fault of network congestion

  RESET NC :   As above

  CLR DER  :   Called party is out of order (System down etc.)

  RESET DER:   As above

  CLR NA   :   The calling DTE os not permitted to obtain the
               connection to the called DTE (Eg: CUG)

  CLR NP   :   The address specified is outside the numbering
               plan or is unassigned.

  CLR RPE  :   A procedure error has been detected at the remote
               DTE network interface

  RESET RPE:   As above

  CLR ERR  :   A procedure error caused by the local DTE is
               detected by the PAD (Eg: Incorrect format)
  RESET ERR:   Same as with CLR ERR

  CLR DTE  :   Remote DTE has cleared or reset the call

  RESET DTE:   As above

  CLR ID   :   The call is not compatible with the remote
               destination.

  CLR CONF :   Response of PAD to valid clearing by the C-DTE

  CLR PAD  :   The PAD has cleared the call at the invitation of
               the correspondent.

  RESET PAD:   The PAD has reset the call (Eg: Loss of input
               characters)

N U A    S T R U C T U R E S
-----------------------------

There are 2 basic NUA formats.   There is the logical structure and the
stupid one.  There are few exceptions like AUSTPAC NUA's which are just
plain crazy.

The best example to demonstrate would be two NUA's one on TYMNET, other on
TELENET both of which access the same system:

TELENET           0311030100341
if you can brake up the NUA into it's components this is what you obtain:

0                  3110                301             00         341
Specifies          DNIC Address        Area Code       nothing    Host
International      for TELENET                         much       Address
Connection

It's important to note that from the TELENET PAD, the NUA would become
C 301 341, so since you are likely to come accross a US made NUA listing
of Telenet, to convert the NUA's into a more conventional form, just add
the 03110 prefix and enough zeroes in between the area code and Address
to give a total of 8 digits. (trailing digits not included)


TYMNET             0310600157241
Again brake up the NUA into its components.

0                  3106                00              1572        41
Specifies          DNIC Address        Area, no        Host        Trailing
International      for TYMNET          particular      Address     Digits
Connection                             pattern                     to be used
                                                                   by local
                                                                   host.
The major ares on TYMNET are 00, 07 and 90.  There are a lot of others but
they don't have significantly large numbers of NUA's and most of them need
two trailing digits which are often somewhere between 01-99. There could
be some sort of logical format to TYMNET, but as yet, I haven't discovered it.

Thus basically the two formats emerge.

0311030100341xx and
03106001572xx   where xx are the trailing digits to provide host with more
                specific info if required.

The NUA's can be up to 15 digits in most cases and the corresponding phone area
code is used in the NUA, with exception of TYMNET, ITAPAC and few others.

America likes to be different from the rest of the world, as demonstrated by
BELL Standards, so they naturally insist on having a slighly different format
to their NUA's. Us PADS do no not have the zero prefix, so just remember to
leave it out. (Now don't ask me why, just do it.)

There are few other exceptions to the universal NUA formats and australia
has one of them. AUSTPAC NUA's are reasonably unique in that the have a
general format of their own. They may look like random assortments of numbers
at first, but there is a definate pattern.(Thank God for that)
Most NUA on AUSTPAC are in the follwing series ie:

224122000, 224123000, 224220000, 224221000 etc
Basically the last digits reain more or less in their low values. ie most
NUA's will be in the series  224122000 - 224122020 for example, with very few
having the end value greater than twenty. Again, there may be two trailing
digits.
The final exception I have found is in the case of DIALNET which is a very
small network not even worth bothering about, unless you want to access
DIALCOM SYSTEMS in countries with no Public Data network of their own.
Their NUA's are of the form 9000xx and are accessibly through primecon
systems only. (perhaps there are other routes but as yet I haven't found them)


INTERNATIONAL DNICS
-------------------

The following is a table of all the current networks I have been able to
track down, some of the blanks are yet to be filled in.
Unfortunatelly not all are serviced by either MIDAS or AUSTPAC, so you may
need to route your connections very carefully if you want to play with a
system in SAUDI ARABIA and in other exotic places.
