-=-=Hacking Networks...-=--=
ok, ANYONE with half a  brain can hack a School Network...I did it when I was
8...that was cool...anyways one way to start is if your school has 
School-wide networking, that makes it SOOO much easier to hack because 
you won't have to get into the computer room...most schools lock the computer
rooms so either you logon from a school wide networked terminal or you 
BREAK IN !!!! oh well, once you get on the terminal there are several things
you can do:
1)"Flip a screen"
2)change grades
3)Accsess dos...
But remeber to NOT LOGON AS YOUR NAME OR YOUR TERMINAL NUMBER, because there
is a log or someone might be watching on another terminal(s)...use another
name or if it asks for your terminal number use another one...(pref. someone
is using so they take the fall)...

1) the easiest thing to do is send a message hold CTRL and press ESC then a
little menu will pop up, select send a message, then choose your victem from
the list....when the little box comes up hold CTRL ENTER until the box fills
up with little symbols (all the same) then you let go of CTRL ENTER and just
hit enter....if your victem is in a App. that's designed for NetWare then
there screen will blank...or they are in a menu it will work....
it pisses them off BIG TIME !!!

2) that is the easiest thing to do...if your school computer "experts" are
dips then they will allow teachers to put grading info on the network,
if not well you can SERIOUSLY screw up the network...but anyways login as
TEACHER thats it !!! that does it no passwords nothing... !! from there
you can do almost ANYTHING like delete items...

3) Ok now for the GOOOOD stuff...Dos...easy logon as ANYONE or any station
to get a TEACHER in trouble then logon as TEACHER....anyways when it says
"please wait" now you goto work....hold CTRL BREAK keep hitting it as much 
as you can until it says "Terminate batch job (y/n)?" then type y...
ok your in dos...alright look EVERYWHERE !!! try typing console that 
should do it ! from there you can down the server !!!

More to come from AA on hacking nets...
