PROBLEM:       Microsoft has identified a vulnerability in the installer for 
               BackOffice Server (R) 4.0. 
PLATFORM:      Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0

BackOffice Server 4.0 Does Not Delete Installation Setup File

Summary
=======
Microsoft (R) has learned of a potential vulnerability in the installer for
BackOffice Server (R) 4.0. The installer asks the user to provide the
account userid and password for selected services and writes these to a file
in order to automate the installation process. However, the file is not
deleted when the installation process completes. As detailed below,
Microsoft recommends that BackOffice 4.0 customers delete this file.

Microsoft has received no reports of customers being adversely affected by
this problem. However, it is releasing this security bulletin in order to
proactively provide customers with information about the problem in order to
allow them to take steps to ensure their safe computing.

Issue
=====
When a user chooses to install SQL Server (R), Exchange Server (R) or
Microsoft Transaction Server (R) as part of a BackOffice 4.0 installation,
the BackOffice installer program requests the name and password for the
accounts associated with these services. Specifically, it asks for the
account name and password for the SQL Executive Logon account, the Exchange
Services Account, and the MTS Remote Administration Account. These values
are stored in <systemdrive>\Program Files\Microsoft Backoffice\Reboot.ini,
and used to install the associated services.

BackOffice Server does not erase this file when the installation process is
completed. This is true regardless of whether the installation process
completes successfully or unsuccessfully. By default, the Microsoft
BackOffice folder is not shared, so network access to reboot.ini generally
does not pose a risk. Users who can log onto the server locally would be
able to access the file, but in most cases this ability is granted only to
selected users such as administrators.

The fix for this problem is to delete the file <systemdrive>\Program
Files\Microsoft Backoffice\Reboot.ini after each BackOffice 4.0
installation, whether successful or not. The file is created only by the
installer, and, once deleted, will not be re-created unless BackOffice 4.0
is re-installed.
