<H1>Hacking Textfiles: The Color Books</H1>
<P>
Somehow I missed this series of files when I was on BBSes in the 1980's, but
they seem legitimate enough, so now you have them too. These are the "Color
Books", books about computer security guidelines purported to be written for
the Department of Defense from the 1980's to the 1990's. They are assigned
arbitrary colors, and each one goes into great detail about a specific
aspect of computer security or, more likely computer security administration.
I've seen these files make a lot of appearences in computer security textfile 
archives, so I assume the combination of Department of Defense conspiracy and
seemingly in-depth (if boring) recounting of principles reach out to something
in the archivist's gut. Judge for yourself.
