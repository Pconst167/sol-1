  INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CATALOGUE

Prior to April 1987, the Information Security Organization of the
National Security Agency published six separate lists of
Information Security products and services.  Those six lists were:

The Endorsed Cryptographic Products List (ECPL) - Contains a
variety of items ranging from components to finished products with
embedded cryptography.  Items are divided into two categories: 
Type 1 which are used to secure classified information and Type 2
which are used to protect only sensitive Government Information.

NSA Endorsed Data Encryption Standard (DES) List - A list of DES
equipments endorsed by the National Security Agency as being in
compliance with Federal Standard 1027 and authorized to protect the
transmission of unclassified information.  This list contains a
description of endorsed DES equipments, data required for ordering
DES keying material, and Points of Contact for more information.

Protected Services List - Provides information on the availability
of communications (voice, data and recorded communications) between
or among government agencies and/or contractors by commercial
carriers which have been approved by the National Security Agency
to protect the transmission of unclassified information.

Evaluated Products List (EPL) - a by-product of the National
Computer Security Center's Commercial Product Evaluation Program: 
the technical evaluation of the protection capabilities of off-
the-shelf, commercially-produced and supported systems.

Preferred Products List (PPL) - Published under the auspices of the
Countermeasures Advisory Panel (CAP) which is made up of DoD and
Civil agencies using specific criteria developed to approve TEMPEST
equipment.  Listing contains those products fully compliant with
all applicable TEMPEST requirements and produced by members of the
U.S. Government's Industrial TEMPEST Program (ITP).

Degausser Qualified Products List (DQPL) - This listing contains
products that have passed the appropriate requirements of the
National Security Agency to degauss magnetic media.  Degaussing
refers to the process whereby information is removed from magnetic
media.  Both Type I and Type II products are identified in this
section.  (This list can be downloaded the BBS file name is 
degausse.zip).

We have consolidated this information into a single publication
called the Information Systems Security Products and Services
Catalogue.  The cost of this Catalogue is $15 for a single copy or
$34 for a yearly subscription (four issues).  Requests for this
document should be addressed directly to:

     The Superintendent of Documents
     U.S. Government Printing Office

Telephone orders may be placed by calling (202) 512-1800.  When
requesting single copies, please specify the issue(s) by month and
year.  The Government Printing Office will accept Choice,
