                                    FIND COMMAND 

The FIND (F) command will provide you with bibliographic information about one
or more books.  Bibliographic information may include authors, title, place of
publication, number of pages, etc. 

The abbreviation for the FIND command is F.  You can search for books by
specifying a subject, an author's name, a title or the title of the series in
which they are found.  For example: 

F S ROBOTS  will get you information on books about robots.

F A TWAIN, MARKwill get you information on books by Mark Twain.

F T BELL TOLLS will get you information on books with these words in the
title, such as "For Whom the Bell Tolls."


                                    TERM COMMAND 

The TERM (T) search provides a way to verify an author's name, a subject
heading or a series title.  If you are not getting the results you want from a
FIND search, a TERM search will often help.  For example, if you could not
find any books by the Galloping Gourmet, you would type T A GALLOPING GOURMET,
and the online catalogue would respond: 
Galloping Gourmet 
 SEE Kerr, Graham. 

When you have located the name or subject that you want, you can do a FIND
search to see information about the relevant books.  Suppose you had done a
search for the subject, androids.  (T S ANDROIDS)  The online catalogue
responds: 
 1.  Androids. 
 2.--Fiction. 
 3.--Juvenile literature. 
If you wanted stories about androids, you would type F 2.  This would get you
information about books under the subject heading ANDROIDS--FICTION.  If you
wanted to see all books about androids, you could type F 1-3 or F 1,2,3.

This table gives some options for doing precise TERM searches. 
                                               Subject   Author   Series 
   General (includes all options given below)    S         A        SE 
   Personal name                                 SP        AP       SEP 
   Corporate (group) name                        SC        AC       SEC 
   Corporate (group) name, by keyword            KSC       KAC      KSEC 
   Uniform title                                 STU       ATU      SET 
   Topical term                                  ST  
   Geographic term FBR command.                  SG  


                                   BROWSE COMMAND 

The BROWSE command provides better searching of subject headings, authors' 
names and series titles when the TERM search produces more than 10 headings.
You will also want to use it if you do not know the exact heading to search.
Browsing allows you to move through the list of headings from a specified
point, displaying all headings in alphabetical order.  The displayed headings
are options that you can use as you continue your search.

The BROWSE search is usually used after a TERM search. To display the
alphabetical list of headings that follow a given heading, type BROWSE
and the number of the heading from the previous TERM search.  BROWSE may be
abbreviated B.  For example, suppose a TERM search gave you these results:

3.    Veterinary medicine. 
4.  --Diagnosis. 
16. --Handbooks, manuals, etc.
5.  --Diagnosis, differential.

                                    TITLE SEARCH 

You can use the title search even when you do not know the exact title of a
book.  The search looks for the titles that include the words you specify.
You can list the words in any order.  You do not have to type the whole title,
but your search wil be more precise if you do. 

For example, all of these searches get you the book "For Whom the Bell Tolls"
F T FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS 
F T TOLLS BELL WHOM 
F T BELL 
The last search is not a good choice, however, because it will get you
information on more than 100 books.  You probably do not want to see it all.

                                   SUBJECT SEARCH 

The library assigns subject headings to books from lists prepared by the
Library of Congress and National Library of Medicine.  If you are certain that
you know the subject that you want (perhaps you found it at the bottom of the
catalogue information from another book), you can simply type FIND SUBJ (or F
S) followed by the subject that you want.  For example, 

F S RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL 
F S TUBA ENSEMBLES 
F S HISTORY--ERRORS, INVENTIONS, ETC.
                                SERIES SEARCH, TITLE 
The series title search will get you information on books in a given series.
If you are reasonably certain that you know the series title, read on.
Otherwise, you will want to do a TERM search to verify the title.

The abbreviation for this search is F SET.  To do this search, simply type the
name of the series.  Because this is not a keyword search, the title must be
accurate.  Here are two examples: 
 F SET STUDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE
 F SET POLLUTION TECHNOLOGY REVIEW 

                            COMBINATION (BOOLEAN) SEARCH 

Combination searching allows you to include two or more concepts in a single
search.  You can search for books by joint authors, books by an author on a
given subject, or any other combination that you can think of.  Search
concepts are combined using the following Boolean operators:

.AND. Both concepts must must be in the books that are retrieved.

.OR.  Either or both concepts must be in the books that are retrieved.

.NOT. Books with the following concept should not be retrieved.

See the examples on this page and the next. 

To find books by Alan Purves about reading comprehension:
 F A PURVES, ALAN C. .AND. S READING COMPREHENSION

Notice that you type the F only once but each concept (A for author, S for
subject) must be identified. 

COMBINATION SEARCH, EXAMPLES 
To find works by Gilbert and Sullivan:
 F A GILBERT, W. S. .AND. A SULLIVAN, ARTHUR

To find works by Griffith Quinby with "PCBs" in the title:
F A QUINBY, GRIFFITH ERNEST .AND. T PCBS

To find works about disarmament or arms control: 
  F S DISARMAMENT .OR. S ARMS CONTROL

To find works by Frank Lloyd Wright or Ludwig Mies van der Rohe:
 F A WRIGHT, FRANK LLOYD .OR. A MIES VAN DER ROHE, LUDWIG

To find works about clinical psychology that were not written by E. Hoch:
F S CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY .NOT. A HOCH, ERASMUS LEONARD

To find works by Nin or Johnson under the subject of literature:
F (A NIN, ANAIS .OR. A JOHNSON, BARBARA) .AND. S AUTHORS, AMERICAN
Notice that you can combine more than two concepts.  Parentheses group items
here just as they do in algebra.  Complex searches like this take a bit longer
to process.  Be prepared to wait a few seconds. 
                          BROADENING A SEARCH (TRUNCATION) 

Sometimes when you are doing a FIND or TERM search, you may not have all the
information needed to do an exact search.  For example, if you are searching
for an author, you may not know his or her middle name or the exact spelling
of the surname.If you are searching by title, you may not know how the
endings of certain key words are spelled.  If you are searching for a series
title, you may be confident about the words at the beginning of the title, but
not the end.  The solution to all these problems is called "truncation."

To do a truncation search, substitute a pound sign (#) for the parts of the
search that you do not know.  For example, if you are not sure what the "F"
stands for in "John F. Kennedy", you would type: 

F A KENNEDY, JOHN F# 

This command will get you information on books by any John Kennedy whose
middle name begins with "F." 

Truncation can be used in a search when you are not sure of the spelling of a
word in the title.  For example, if you want to search a title containing the
words "online" and "catalogue," but are not sure whether the word is spelled
"catalogue," "catalogues," "catalog" or "catalogs," you would type:

F T ONLINE CATALOG# 

Truncation can also be used to search a series title when you know the words
at the beginning of the title, but are unsure about the words at the end.  For
example: 
 F T STUDIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY# 

Truncation is also useful when you are searching for subjects.  If you want
information about the Champaign area, type: 

  T S CHAMPAIGN# 

This search retrieves information about the city, the county and the region.


                                  THE LINK COMMAND 

The two parts of the online catalogue, LCS and FBR, have separate pools of
data.  As you already know, FBR has flexible searching capabilities, but no
call numbers or locations.  However, you can do an FBR FIND search and then
ask to see the LCS data that corresponds to your results by using the LINK (L) command.


For example, the title search F T SOCIAL WORK DEVIANT retrieves only one
record.  To see the corresponding LCS record, you would type L.  The search, F
T PLANNING NOW, retrieves 4 titles.  In this case, you could ask to see all 4
LCS records (L 1-4) or specific individual matching LCS records (L 1,3).

It is important to know that not all FBR records link to LCS records.  The FBR
database contains information about books from several libraries. Because some
of these libraries do not use LCS, some books are not linked.  Nevertheless,
the title could be in LCS, so you should always try an LCS search using LCS
commands. 

                                 LCS SYSTEM CODES

There are three commands which can be used for general searching in LCS:  ATS/ 
for author-title searches, TLS/ for title searches, and AUT/ for author search- 
es.  The following explanations use as an example the book Oliver Twist by 
Charles Dickens. 
 
ATS/  The search code consists of the first four letters of the author's last 
      name and the first five letters of the first word in the title.  (Words 
      on the stoplist are not used; see HELP,STOPLIST.) 
      example:  ATS/DICKOLIVE 
 
TLS/  The search code consists of the first four letters of the first word in 
      the title and the first five letters of the second word in the title. 
      (Words on the stoplist are not used.) 
      example:  TLS/OLIVTWIST 
 
AUT/  The search code consists of the first six letters of the author's last 
      name and the first three letters of the author's first name. 
      example:  AUT/DICKENCHA 

IF THERE IS ONLY ONE MATCH TO A SEARCH CODE, LCS WILL DISPLAY THE DETAILED IN- 
FORMATION FOR THE ITEM.  THE DETAILED INFORMATION INCLUDES THE CALL NUMBER, 
AUTHOR, TITLE, PLACE OF PUBLICATION, PUBLICATION DATE, NUMBER OF COPIES, LOCA- 
TION OF EACH COPY, AND WHETHER THE ITEM IS CHARGED. 
 
IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE MATCH TO A SEARCH CODE, LCS DISPLAYS A TRUNCATED LIST 
OF ALL THE ITEMS MATCHING THE CODE.  THIS LIST IS IN RANDOM ORDER.  TO OBTAIN 
COMPLETE INFORMATION ON A DESIRED ITEM, A SEARCH BY LINE (DSL/) MUST BE PER- 
FORMED. 
 
The shelf position search is used to provide a display of titles in a call num- 
ber area.  It is similar to browsing the shelves because classification systems 
are designed to place materials on the same subject together as well as all 
editions of an item.  The shelf position search can be used as a rough form of 
subject searching.  To do a shelf position search, type the search command SPS/ 
followed by part or all of a call number. 
 
This search displays the 15 titles that are shelved before and the 15 titles 
that are shelved after a call number.  The number you typed will be displayed 
on line 16.  The first display is page 2.  Type PG1 to get the preceding page 
or type PG3 to get the following page.  To obtain detailed information on a 
title, a detailed search by line (DLS/) must be performed.  To continue an SPS 
beyond PG3, reenter SPS/ and last call number listed on PG3. 

IF YOUR SEARCH HAS PRODUCED MORE THAN ONE TITLE, READ DOWN THE LIST OF TITLES 
TO DETERMINE WHICH LINE SHOWS YOUR ITEM.  TO DISPLAY THE COMPLETE INFORMATION 
FOR THIS ITEM ENTER A DETAILED SEARCH BY LINE NUMBER.  THE FORMAT FOR THIS IS: 
DSL/N  WHERE N IS THE LINE NUMBER OF THE TITLE WANTED.  YOU MAY ALSO ASK FOR 
INFORMATION FOR MORE THAN ONE LINE AT A TIME.  THE LINE NUMBER IS ON THE LEFT 
OF THE SCREEN.  FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
A TITLE SEARCH FOR "HARD TIMES" MIGHT PRODUCE THIS DISPLAY: 
 
PAGE 1           2 MATCHES            0 SKIPPED         (ALL DISPLAYED IN 1) 
 
01  DICKENS, CHARLES        HARD TIMES                              1854 
02  TERKEL, LOUIS           HARD TIMES                              1970 
 
THE COMMAND DSL/1  ASKS FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TITLE ON LINE 1 WHILE 
THE COMMAND DSL/1/2 ASKS FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT BOTH LINES 1 AND 2. 
IF YOUR SEARCH HAS PRODUCED MORE THAN 10 TITLES, YOU MUST ASK FOR ADDITIONAL 
PAGES OF MATCHES TO COMPLETELY SCAN THE LIST (THE COMPUTER DISPLAYS ONLY 10 
MATCHES AT A TIME.)  ENTERING THE FOLLOWING: 
 
PG2  WILL DISPLAY THE 2ND GROUP OF 10 MATCHES 
PG3  WILL DISPLAY THE 3RD GROUP OF 10 MATCHES 
PG+  WILL DISPLAY THE 4TH GROUP OF 10 MATCHES 
 
REPEAT THIS SEQUENCE, PG2, PG3, PG+ UNTIL YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR ITEM, THEN USE 
THE DETAILED SEARCH BY LINE (DSL/) TO DISPLAY THE DETAILED INFORMATION. 

To search other college libraries' LCS databases add one of the codes 
shown below to your search.  You may only search one college at a time.
