
        A lot of you are probably feeling the same I way am right at the
moment I am writing this file.  I just got done applying for a nice board
and I simply went blank while filling out the New User Application!  I
really hope I gain access, but I hate having to remember what is what
all the time.  Besides, it's been almost a year since I have had to fill
out a REAL challenging application!  So, I have forgotten probably 90% of
my acronyms!  A shame really because if I could only remember what they
meant, I'm sure I could remeber what they were!  That's why I made this file!
To help us all remember what is what!  I'm sure tons of SysOp's are going to
come down on me for telling what the acronyms mean..but remember.. I am NOT
telling what they do, are used for, or anything of that nature.  Just what
they STAND for!  So, don't give me too hard of a time.  This may help you
define better New User applications for your board to be more selective!  I
will try to come out with updates as my time allows for this file.

My Disclaimer:
        I don't know why I need one..but here it is..I take no resposiblity
for anything in this file, anything it's used for, or anyone that reads it!
I pretty much don't take responsibility for anything at ALL and I am beginning
to doubt that I exist.  Oh well, on to the file!

        Well, anyways, I guess that should get you started for a while, but
I should be coming out with acro02.txt very, very soon.  {Probably like in
a day or so}  Look for it and help me spread this around!

        Another note!  Due to a hard drive crash, I lost ALL {I do mean ALL}
of my cool BBS numbers!  If you run a cool BBS and would like to have me give
ya a ring send me up the number somewhere I am!  Which is probably in the
606 or 513 area code..either that or on one of the few boards I did find
around on paper.

        In closing, I would like to thank the following folks!  Insanus
Maximus, Akira, Lestat, and Captain Blah.  {<- My local Greets {hehe}} In the
far away lands from me, I would like to say 'Hi' to Starbuck {thanks for
saving my account!}, Digitone Cypher, and Night Ranger...as well as all the
other dudes in LoL/Phuck that are too many for me to mention right now!

        Any questions or comments should be sent to me {user #2} on The
Quest's End at (606)491-3483...

                        Thanks and Catch ya later,
                                Max Headroom {513}
