  Watch can be invoked on some
machines by typing 'watch', or just
'w'.  If
  no particular User ID is specified,
it will ask you for a User ID.  At this
  point, you enter a User ID, ? for a
list, or 999 to exit the program.

  The link is one way, so you can't
type things for the person you are  
watching.  It's fun to watch someone
watching you, watching them, watching
  you, etc.  Gets confusing.

  Resembling watch is another USER
monitoring program call PEEK. (Which
i'm sure you know what it does -- yes
it peeks the desired users buffer for 
viewing.

  Peek also has some extensive
commands such as:

  1) Invoking a user list
  2) Showing the STAT US
  3) Duplex mode
  4) Invoking a Prime command
  5) POKE entry:

      Allows monitoring user to POKE
commands at the user who is being 
monitored.  Very nice -- Had loads of
fun with this one.

Ok, i found a primos system on
telenet. How should i begin to hack it?

I tried all those common ids and
passwords in the hacking primos file
but none werk. Someone help me! the

Hey Doc, I'm home....anyway, gosh,
where di yo use Peek <snicker>

Underlord -
Many Primes found in 303 turn out to
be Dialcoms - a system based on Primos, 
but alot more difficult to get around
in....30323 sounds vaguely familar...Iy 
may not be a dialcom after
all..Anyway, sometimes you get lucky
with the defaults , and other times
...well you know....After you try the
standard list of defaults from a list,
try common names...I've had quite a
bit of success with JOHN,JOHN and
RICHARD,RICHARD and CHRIS,CHRIS...give
those a shot.
Try hacking on Primes found in 617.
Prime Inc, being based in 617 area has 
many machines in that prefix, and also
tend to have alot of their defaults in 
place...
some good ons to try:
617455
617585
617556

Good luck

7/24: Watch rumors
Name: >UNKNOWN<
Date: <-> INACTIVE <->

  Epsilon... Watch being started by
only entering "w" wasn't a standard of
any sort. That was only on SUNY's
system so the students wouldn't figure
out what it was if they found the
command directory (CMDNC0, CMDNC1,
etc...)

Peek is great! But Watch is suppose to
also allow the poke option to
allow you to type characters for
someone else. Peek's unique feature is
viewing the entered user number for a
given line. It will allow you to
read that person's or line's AMLC
buffer... (let's just say last so
many characters entered.). The buffer
size depends on what the system has
that line set for. It can be from 1K
to 10K. This is a great feature to use
it for seeing what the System Console
(user 1) is up to... you'd be able to
tell if it logged the DTE address of a
Telenet port you called through on
an invalid login for instance. Oh
yeah, with Peek, the user doesn't have
to
be logged in. As far as I can tell, it
won't display the user's password
if they just logged in though.

Usually Peek isn't found in the
command directories. User's may have it
as an abbreviation and the actual
program in one of their Sub UFD's
for security reasons. There's another
program called PEEK and SCAN in the
command directories also. SCAN is
another watch program but can also be
a program to scan directories for
filenames. Scan's main feature is
to SCAN the system and watch so many
seconds for every user.

8/24: Config Files
Name: Prime Suspect #70

  Sorry about the last post being
anonymous. That was an accident... I
signed
it at the bottom anyway.

   Some files you may wish to look at
to see what the system logs and
so on are the following:

CMDNC0>PRIMOS.COMI    A COMI file full
of all commands to be run
                      for the system
to startup. Usually it's automatically
                      run after a
power outage, but can also be executed
                      from the system
console if the system was previously
                      shut down.

CMDNC0>CONFIG         This file is
normally called "CONFIG" but can be
                      anything
(usually ...".CONFIG" if not CONFIG)
                      as assigned by
the CONFIG command used in the 
PRIMOS.COMI
                      file. This file
contains abbreviations and
                      and arguments
for things such as LOGLOG which will
                      send the
username and time to the system
console of
                      each log in if
set to YES. BADLOG logs only invalid
                      attempts. If
networked it also sends the originating
                      address... such
as telenet port addresses.

The Command directory is usually
contained in MFD 0 and called
CMDNC0. But it can be in any MFD and
called anything in the form of
CMDNCx. Such as CMDNC1.

The SYSTEM directory contains things
such as SHAREd memory
files... and utilities for major
software packages dealing with
memory, and line assignment.

  Prime -

  Yeah, I see.  But on the particular
version of peek that I was using, you
  could hit - (I believe) to throw you
into poke mode.  Does this hold
  true for the systems you've been on?

this may shound like a stupid question
but i don't know primos- how do ya 
print a text file? I like the os but
don't
get the directory structure.  I listed
all the files, but i think they were 
all
directories.  Now i know there are
records in each directory which are the
files themselves.  What command would
i use to change directories? I went
through the help file many many times
but nothing.  It suggested AT dirname 
but the command doesn't exist. 
Anyone?  Why can't people just convert
to
unix??? heh

11/24: basic usage
Name: Prime Suspect #70

LD   brings up a list of files and
directories with headers.

If you want just the filenames (no
sub-ufds (dirs)) you would use[

LD -FILE

ATTACH and A are the very same... but
to attach to a subdirectory
you would enter it like:

A *>SUB-UFD-NAME

SLIST filename        shows you the
contents of a file


Wild characters are "-" and "--".

To list all commands that are CPL
listings do the following:

A CMDNC0
LD --CPL -NW    (the -NW won't give
you the --MORE-- prompt... =NOWAIT)

12/24: Directory headers
Name: Prime Suspect #70
Date: 1:48 am  Mon Aug 08, 1988

  not referring to what you see
printed.

The actual FILE headers (made[a
mistake for the title of this msg)
contain a lot of information. One
thing is the Passwords assigned to
password directories. Other
information used for security, etc...
is the time/date info stored for
things like:

last read
created on
last modified
last backed up
and so on... if anyone's interested in
seeing the actual structure
as read in by the source code say so.

To look at some info type i[ "LD
filename -DETAIL"
or -DET.
The passwords are never visible to the
OS user at any time.... but can
be accessed through programming if you
have ALL access[to that directory.
(or PDALURW... or simply P for protect)
If you want to see a long file for all
the args for LD do this:

a help*;slist ld.help

One nice option is   LD -SORTDTC and
it lists the files in reverse
order of when they were created...
also LD -CRA date
or something similiar to see what
files were added after a certain
time/date.
I use that for searching for new
commands added , etc.

Some system operators use these
options to look for files that may
have been
added over the weekend when the system
wasn't suppose to be used... or
in the morning.

Sometimes the CREATE date gets screwed
after backups to equal the backup
date.

Prime: Thanks for the help. Still,
some of the commands you mentioned do
not exist.  For instance, LD. This
system I was on seems to be owned by a
big company and would have the need
for such commands but they are just
not there. MH knows his share about
primes, maybe he can help. (he has the
#) Next time I'm on I'll buffer my

    It sounds like you have a pre-rev
19.0 system. Most likely an 18. 
something. In this case forget about
trying to learn Primos as your new
knowledge would be useless in most
cases unless it's a VERY interesting
owner. Try "L", "LIST","LISTF" to list
files. L will work fine.

Try this out for seeing something

ATTACH LIB
EDB CCMAIN.BIN
   F ALL

If CCMAIN.BIN doesn't exist...just use
another .BIN file there
like PFTNLB.BIN or something. These
are the libraries loaded when
compiling a program.[Doing an "F ALL"
shows you the functions and calls
used in that library.

Kind of interesting for seeing what's
