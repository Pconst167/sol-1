Greetings fellow CyberNauts:

This gem was downloaded from the DDN on the InterNet. It is a good
guide for learning to hack the Net. If you like what you see leave
note for Argonaut at Rivendell BBS (816) 563-4845. This is my Home
of Port and a small but growing hack/phreak node.

	    FEATURES OF THE TAC ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM (TACACS)


To log in to the network via a MILNET TAC, you MUST have a unique ID
and Access Code (TAC Access Card).  These cards are issued by the DDN
Network Information Center (NIC) only after a user has been authorized
by the Host Administrator of the host on which the user has his
primary mailbox or account.

IF YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED YOUR TAC ACCESS CARD, AND HAVE A LEGITIMATE 
REQUIREMENT TO ACCESS THE NETWORK VIA A MILNET TAC, CONTACT YOUR HOST 
ADMINISTRATOR!  (DO NOT CONTACT THE NIC FOR AUTHORIZATION).

If you do not know who your Host Administrator is, you may find out by
using the "WHOIS" command on the NIC.DDN.MIL host.  Instructions on
using "WHOIS" are as follows: When you finish reading this message,
type "quit" as instructed.  After the connection to NIC.DDN.MIL is closed,
type "@n" again.  You will be told how to find your Host Administrator.
When finished, type "logout<RETURN>" at the prompt and you will be
returned to the TAC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TACACS, the access control system for MILNET TACs, requires you to log
in before a connection to a host may be completed.  The login process
is automatically started with the first @open (@o) command you issue.
There is a @close (@c) command to close the TAC connection and also a
@logout (@l) command to logout.  Otherwise, the functioning of the TAC
is essentially unaffected by the access control system.

Here is a sample of the login dialogue:


First, the command to get the TAC's attention is Control-Q.

(a) PVC-TAC 111 #: 01                This is the last line of the TAC
                                     herald, which the TAC uses to
                                     identify itself.  When you see the
                                     herald, the TAC is ready for your
                                     command.

(b) @o 26.2.0.8<RETURN>              The user inputs the command to
    -------------------              open a connection plus the
                                     internet address of the host to
                                     which he wishes to connect,
                                     followed by a Carriage Return.

(c) TAC Userid: SAMPLE.LOGIN<RETURN> Here the TAC prompts the user for
                -------------------- his Userid.  The user enters his
                                     ID exactly as shown as shown on
                                     his TAC Access Card, followed by
                                     a Carriage Return.

(d) Access Code: 22bgx4467<RETURN>   Again the TAC prompts the user,
                 -----------------   who responds by entering his
                                     Access Code as shown on his TAC
                                     Access Card, followed by a
                                     Carriage Return.

(e) Login OK                         The TAC validates the ID/Access
    TCP trying...Open                code and proceeds to open the 
                                     requested connection.

HELPFUL INFORMATION:

When entering your TAC Userid and Access Code:

- A carriage return terminates each input line and causes the next
  prompt to appear.

- As you type in your TAC Userid and Access Code, it does not matter
  whether you enter an alphabetic character in upper or lower case.
  All lower case alphabetic characters echo as upper case for the
  Userid.

- The Access Code is not echoed in full-duplex mode.  An effort is
  made to obscure the Access Code printed on hardcopy terminals in
  half-duplex mode.

- You may edit what you type in by using the backspace (Control-H)
  key to delete a single character.

- You may delete the entire line and restart by typing Control-U.
  A new prompt will appear.

- While entering either the TAC Userid or Access Code, you may type
  Control-C to abort the login process and return to the TAC command
  mode. You must interrupt or complete the login process in order to
  issue any TAC command.

- The @reset (@r) command resets the TAC and returns you to the TAC
  welcome banner.

IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH TAC LOGIN:

Should the login sequence fail (as indicated by the response "Bad
login"), examine your Access Card carefully to ensure that you are
entering the ID and Access Code correctly.  Note that Access Codes
never contain a zero, a one, a "Q" or a "Z", as each of these
characters may be mistaken for another character.  If you see what
appears to be one of these characters in your access code, it is
really the letter "O" (oh), or "G" (gee), the letter "L" (el), or the
number "2" (two).

If you have followed all of the above steps as indicated, and if you
are sure you are entering your ID and Access Code correctly, and you
still cannot log in, call the Network Information Center at (415)
859-3695 or (800) 235-3155 for help.

AFTER LOGGING IN:

Your TAC port will remain logged in as long as you have an open
connection.  If you close the connection, you will have ten minutes in
which to reopen a connection without having to log in again.  If you do
not reopen a connection within ten minutes, the TAC will attempt to
hang up your port, and will automatically log you out.

WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED:

Always close the connection using "@c" then log out using the "@l" command.
Typing "@r" (reset) has no effect on your logged-in status.

If you now wish to log in to the TAC, leave the TACNEWS program by
typing "quit" at the next prompt.  This will return you to the TAC,
and you may then begin the login sequence with the @o command to the
TAC.
