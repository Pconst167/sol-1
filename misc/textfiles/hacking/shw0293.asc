Title: Red Hot Dutch To Be Banned?

This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in a silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands.

               William Shakespeare - King Richard II

The  porn channel Red Hot Television may well be banned by the  UK 
government. It is no longer called Red Hot Dutch since it does not 
uplink  from Holland any more. It now uplinks from  Denmark.  Some 
how  the  title  "Red Hot Danish" would not  sound  right  and  it 
appears  that  Continental  Television,  the  owners  of  Red  Hot 
Television opted for the more conservative name.

The current feeling among some of the more conservative members of 
the  UK  government is that Red Hot Television  is  polluting  and 
corrupting  the  British  public.  It is in  a  sense  a  cultural 
insularity.  As you can see from the quotation from  Shakespeare's 
Richard II, this element of insularity existed even then.  Perhaps 
these people are the victims of selective amnesia.

Shakespeare's writings were often of a more colourful nature  than 
these  people  would  ever care to admit.  The  reason  that  this 
information is not immediately obvious is because it requires some 
knowledge  of  the  slang  of  Shakespeare's  time.  Regicide  and 
homicide.  Sex  and politics. If Shakespeare was around  today  he 
would probably be working in Hollywood.

The  prime minister of the UK mentioned in a speech recently  that 
the UK had a thousand years of history to be proud of. A  thousand 
years? What happened to the other thousands of years? The years of 
Celtic history, of Roman history, of Anglo-Saxon history? It seems 
that this thousand years of history began with the Norman invasion 
of Britain. 

This  culture of which the British are proud is a  tapestry  woven 
from  the threads of many cultures. The epic Beowulf, reckoned  to 
be the first epic in the Anglo-Saxon language is actually based on 
the  Irish  epic  Tain Bo Fraic. The Anglo-Saxon  king  who  wrote 
Beowulf  was educated in Ireland. Throughout England, the  Celtic, 
Roman,  Anglo-Saxon  and  Norman influences can  be  seen  in  the 
landscape and heard in the everyday speech. Other influences  from 
subsequent migrations are also making themselves felt.
                            
Seen  in  the light of the previous paragraphs, the  arguments  in 
favour  of  maintaining  cultural sanctity   by  banning  Red  Hot 
Television is not logical. But then the psychology of human beings 
is  never logical. Many of those in favour of banning it are  male 
and either in or past their forties.

Of  course  there  are other arguments in favour  of  banning  the 
channel.  Some of these are based on the fact that the movies  are 
exploitational and immoral. In the background you can almost  hear 
that   great   moralist  Saint  Augustine   feverishly   indenting 
parchment.  Interestingly enough Saint Augustine became  extremely 
moral  when   after a life of debauchery  he  was  afflicted  with 
impotence.

Legally,  the  UK  Government are on even  thinner  ice.  If  they 
proscribe  Red  Hot Television, they are, in the opinion  of  some 
legal experts, in contravention of EC law. The situation may arise 
that  while it might be legal to ban Red Hot Television  under  UK 
law, it would be illegal for the UK government to ban the  channel 
under EC law. EC law has precedent over national law.

However, the EC may chose to allow the UK government to  interpret 
the  law  in  a  flexible fashion. In the  light  of  the  present 
situation, it would be stupid for the UK government to ban Red Hot 
Television.  By forcing the channel underground, they would  cause 
the  viewing  figures to mushroom. Now if they were  clever,  they 
would create a new tax.    

The  programming  on Red Hot Television is  definitely  hard  core 
porn, one viewer referred to it as zero-simulation programming. In 
its  defence it could be argued that there is a similar  level  of 
programming available via TV1000 or Canal Plus.


Title: The Advent Of Opt Out

While in the United States, local advertising on cablenets is  the 
norm,  it  is  relatively  new in  Europe.  Perhaps  there  is  an 
exception in the UK. The Independent Television Franchises in  the 
UK who sometimes slot in advertising during networked programmes.

Cablelink  are awaiting the licence from the Irish  Government  to 
sell opt out advertising time on various channels. Apparently  Sky 
One and Sky News will be restored to the Cablelink cable and  MMDS 
nets  after  this  licence is granted. Cablelink  will  then  sell 
advertising  time  which  will  be inserted in  place  of  the  UK 
originated adverts.

Among  the  subscribers  on Cablelink's nets  Sky  One  is  sorely 
missed. Sky One however is not considered that much of a loss  and 
many people would prefer CNN.

The  likelihood of Cablelink being granted a licence to  sell  opt 
out  advertising may have increased. The advertising  revenue  cap 
that  the  Broadcasting  Act  had placed  on  the  state  monopoly 
broadcaster,  RTE  has been removed. There are also  some  rumours 
that RTE is thinking about running a channel on ASTRA.


Title: Red Hot Television To Scramble With Enigma on March 20th

Red  Hot  Television will introduce its new  Enigma  1  scrambling 
system  on March 20th. The new scrambling system is based on  line 
video  cut  and rotate scrambling and is believed  to  have  other 
elements that have not yet been announced.

At  one stage it was considered that Red Hot Television would  use 
the Cryptovision scrambling system. There has been no reason given 
for  Red Hot Television's choice of system. Some  hackers  believe 
that the reason could be connected with the present deployment  of 
Cryptovision. This system is used in Scandinavia on cablenets  and 
also  in  Ireland  on the Cablelink cable and MMDS  nets.  With  a 
potential  pirate market of some 200,000 decoders in Ireland,  the 
system  could  become the target of a hack. At  present  the  main 
deterrent  in Ireland is the fact that hacking a cable system  for 
the purposes of commercial piracy is a crime punishable by a  fine 
of  twenty  thousand  pounds and or a two  year  prison  sentence. 
Anyway the Irish hackers are currently more concerned with hacking 
satellite borne channels as the law does not cover these channels.


Title: Card Tricks EuroCrypt Update

It appears that the Card Tricks Pseudo Card has greatly  disturbed 
FilmNet and TV1000. The response from the would-be viewing  public 
was phenomenal. The release date for the P-card is now March.  The 
sheer quantity of orders has caused a backlog.

What  is now apparent is that the EuroCrypt card system  has  been 
compromised. The EuroCrypt system was based on the concept of  the 
detachable secure microcontroller. This concept is a good  concept 
though any hack on such a system would be catastrophic.

There  are  three  types  of  hack;  non-critical,  critical   and 
catastrophic.  A  non-critical hack can be rapidly overcome  by  a 
slight  modification to the system and often has a lifetime  of  a 
few  weeks. A critical hack is naturally more dangerous. While  it 
does  attack the very heart of the system, it is possible for  the 
system  to  recover.  The catastrophic hack is  perhaps  the  most 
dangerous  for  a system. In order for the system to  recover,  an 
element or indeed the complete system has to undergo a redesign. 

The hack on the EuroCrypt system can be designated a  catastrophic 
hack.  The  central element of the EuroCrypt  system,  namely  the 
smart card, must now be redesigned. This would not be a major task 
as  it  would involve replacing the existing EPROM  card  with  an 
EEPROM card. The problem here is that the control word  generation 
algorithms and the HASH algorithms have to be rewritten.

The  new  smart cards will be EEPROM and therefore  slightly  more 
secure than the EPROM type that has just been hacked. One thing is 
certain,  those  associated with the EuroCrypt system  will  never 
again have such blind faith in the system.
