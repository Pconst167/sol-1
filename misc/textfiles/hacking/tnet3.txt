This guide provides brief but specific instructions for setting up an 
asynchronous, ASCII, character mode terminal to mimic the functions of a   
3270, EBCDIC, block mode terminal.  The asynchronous terminal can then use 
TYMNET Asynchronous-to-3270 software to access an IBM 370 or compatible host   
computer through the TYMNET network.
