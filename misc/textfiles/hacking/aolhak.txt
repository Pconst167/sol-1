      First of all, this file will be of the most help to the beggining
hacker on AOL, while most experienced hackers will find most of the
information useful, but not all will be new to them.  Now on with the
hacking!

      We will start out with easy things...


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              ***How to send random IM's***

      Go to "Send instant message" under the members pull down menu.  Now, in
the space where it says "To", space over *exactly* ten (10) times.  Then type
in the message and send!  Easy, huh?

                    NOTE: this trick might also work with mail, try it 'cuz we haven't!

                                            ***How to do Text Manipulation***

                           1st, using your mouse, highlight three lines of
text in the chat room.  Make sure that all three lines have been said by
different people, and that you also highlight their screen names!  Then, go
to the edit bar, and select copy.  After that, Click your mouse on the spot
where you write what you want to say...  Then go back up to the edit bar, and
click paste.  All of the text that you have highlighted should show up where
you type in what you want to say.  Now, find the screen name that has 2
little sqaures in front of it, and 1 behind it.  Delete everything, except
that and the colon in-between them.  Once you've done that, type what you
want to say after the squares, and type the persons screen name for who you
want to say it in side the squares.  Then just send it, and it should
work...if it doesn't then you must REALLY be a lamer!

                             ***How to d/l for free and talk while downloading***

                                                   1. Start the dowload.

			          2. Hit ALT-TAB

                                  3. Once you are in program manager hit ALT-F4

	                    4. Windows will then say Exiting Windows "yes" 
  	                    or "cancel"...hit yes

		         5. AOL will then ask you if you want to exit

                          			6. Hit "no"
 
                  	     7. Your cursor will come back, you then can go 
		        to a chat area and talk while your download
		        it still going.

	                    8. The download window will still be there until
		      the download is complete

	                     9. If you wanna download for free, do what
		          I explained above and instead of staying
	                        in a chat area and talking just go into	
		          a free area while it's downloading.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         ***How to chat for free on AOL***

     Ok...the first thing you do is click on the box at the bottom that says
discover AOL.  Now choose "Best of AOL".  Then minimize both windows.
Next...minimize the welcome screen...Ok almost there...now enter the free
area and go to the "Windows" pull down
menu.  Select "Best of AOL".  When it asks you if you want to leave the free
area select "NO".  Guess what?  The window opens anyway.  Now move down until
you see "Chat Live".  Click on it and it sends you to chat.  Essentialy you
are in the free area but accessing chat. That's it.  You are chatting for
free.

     As far as I can tell this method is not only foolproof but also
GuideProof!:)  I logged on with a hacked account and found a guide and talked
to her for 30 minutes and she never said anything so maybe they can't tell at
all.  Well we'll see.  Just remember this if they DO find out about it, it
will be a HELL of a lot easier for them figure out who is doing this than it
was for them to figure out who the fives were.  

     NOTE: To send mail, look at mail, download mail, etc. just open up and
minmize your mailbox instead or along with "Best Of AOL"
     
     NOTE: You can minimize anything for this trick to work, not JUST "Best
Of AOL".

                                    ***Using credit card numbers on AOL***

     To use credit cards to pay for online time you must first know a couple
of things...Visa numbers always start with a 4, master card a 5, etc.  This
is all you need to know!  I will give you 20 free Visa Card numbers.  But if
you got this file pack in it's entirety then you have credit.zip that
generates credit card numbers and you won't need these.

                                        ***The fine art of password fishing***

      All this is, is using text manipulation to act as an authority and ask
for passwords. But here are some passwords\screen names that will work for you.

Screen name\password:                       
                                                            if you change the password for these screen names,
                                                            or hell if you just get new ones, tell me i am ThE cRowE

                                           ***How to boot people off-line***

       To do this trick the person MUST be on a PC!  IM someone or get them
to IM you, when they reply type something in the message box and copy it, now hold down
Control-L and keep on pressing send.  This overloads the memory or some shit
like that and they will be gone in a few minutes.
