Section 3.... CARDING
                       
                       Everything needed to be known about
                               Credit Carding
                                by FlapJack

        Let me introduce myself, I am FlapJack, hacker/phreak/pirate/carder. 
In this first of my series of texts I will explain the way to card. The 
members of HAVOK and I are not responsible for your actions taken in this 
matter, this is only meant to be educational.


Make sure you read everything before you start!!!!!!!


1. In order to start carding you need to be smart and a quick thinker, this 
is very important unless you want to get caught and be doing time in jail. 
This means you have to practice with talking smoothly on the phone and 
trying not to laugh. Try prank calling Pet Stores or Exterminators, if you 
can do this without cracking up then you are all set!


2. You first need a credit card number. There are many ways to get this.
   A) You can go trashing. Trashing is sort of dangerous and should only be 
      done at night. This means you are going to have to jump in a dumpster 
      and look for carbon copies of receipts. It is best if you go with a 
      few people, so you have at least one person as look out. Also, bring a 
      hat. This is your excuse, it might not work at 12 midnight, but its 
      worth a try. Just throw it in the dumpster and when the old pigs come 
      around after their Drunkin' Donuts run, just say you were walking home 
      from a party and one of your friends through your hat in the dumpster. 
      You then take it out of there and start walking away and when Mr. Pig 
      goes away you go back and finish your job. Since there is no curfew 
      that I know of in Connecticut, you have a right to be out at night but 
      you WILL be stopped by a cop sometime during the night. This is 
      probably the most dangerous but the most effective way to find credit 
      card numbers. Your best bet is to try banks, many have paper shreaders, 
      but still there are a lot of cheap bosses who do not want to invest in 
      them. Hard Copy did this same thing, but they applied for credit cards 
      with social security numbers and actually got 7 out of 8 tries. You can 
      also try Radio Shack, Caldors, Ames, Bradlees, etc. I think the best are 
      banks and/or travel agencies, they both mainly deal with credit cards. 
      This is the most effective because you will have the expiration date 
      and the person's name on the carbon, which will cut down on some extra 
      work.
   B) Another way to get numbers is to take your parents number. Use the 
      credit number generator enclosed with this pak and check for valid 
      numbers. You will know the expiration date because it will be on the 
      card, but I will get to that a little later. Only use the check for 
      valid credit numbers command, extrapolating card numbers works but its 
      hard to get the right expiration date. Here is the process of getting a 
      valid number:
        Say your number was 5000-0000-0000-0009, this is a real number but I 
        don't now the expiration date so its worthless. You then use 
        Cmatser2.exe and pick C. This checks for the valid credit card number 
        and fixes it if its wrong. All the next numbers after this one go up 
        by ten and by ones. This is how the next number will look like: 
        5000-0000-0000-001X, X is not known so that's why you use the checker, 
        all you do now once you press C, put 5000000000000010, if its wrong 
        which it is, it will correct it and tell you the right number. Write 
        it down, now put C and put 5000000000000020, it will then fix this 
        one, write this down again too. Keep doing it this way and you will 
        eventually learn the pattern of how the ones number is when you raise 
        ten. Understand? I hope! Do this until you get about 30 card numbers. 
        Do not use the 5000-0000-0000-XXXX number I gave you because it has 
        not and probably will not be issued. Generate from you parenst number 
        like I said above. Just raise the 15th number by ten and end it with 0 
        then check it and it will fix it. Put all the other numbers in though, 
        only change the last two!! All 5 means is that it is Master Card, 4 is 
        Visa, etc.. There are usually 16 numbers so that's why i use 16, but 
        the least there could be is 13. In the next step I will tell you how 
        make sure that it is valid.


3) If you went trashing to find your credit card number, then you already 
   know the expiration date so skip this step. If you generated manually by 
   Cmaster2, then do this step! Since you used your parent's number you 
   already know the expiration date. Now take your 30 valid credit card 
   numbers and go down to a pay phone. Now only use #30, 30 being the last 
   number that you generated manually. Call 1-800-WET-TITS now. Enter #30's 
   number followed by the pound sign, #. Then it will say Please enter the 
   valid expiration date in 4 digits meaning 2 for the month and the last 
   two for the year, example: 0496, put the pund sign again. If the 
   expiration date is correct it will say, "You have been recognized as a 
   new member." and you will get customer service, now you can either have 
   some fun or hang-up. DO NOT USE THIS NUMBER AGAIN unless you call the 
   hot lines like the one I just gave you. They will be investigating the 
   number once you hang-up. Only call the number I gave, some of the other 
   hot lines like that do not care what the expiration date is, this is the 
   only one I know of that tells you if its correct. The expiration date is 
   the most important besides the number, its also a form of security against 
   credit card fraud. Once you have this step done, you can move to the next 
   step. 


4) Now you need to find a drop site, an empty house to have what you want 
   sent to. Look for places around by you. There are some really old houses 
   by me that are vacant, all you have to do is mow the lawn and make sure 
   there's a mail box and curtains in the window. Through my studies on this 
   credit carding, I found out mostly all the ways to get the things sent to 
   your house, I will talk about this near the end of this step. You must 
   also be able to go in the house so it looks like you walk out the door. 
   Use your best judgement, if you were UPS would you send something to the 
   house? This is very crucial to the ordering process.
        When you call to order, which will be the next step, you will have 
   to decide the way of travel for your order, UPS or Federal Express. UPS 
   ground service takes about 1 week, which is dangerous because that give 
   the company time to bill the credit card company. When it comes you will 
   have to sign for it, no matter what, if you aren't there when it comes 
   in, you will have to go to the nearest UPS headquarters, there's one in 
   either Union City or Naugatuck, CT. Federal Express is much quicker but 
   costs more, hey its not your card so who cares! Federal Express is either 
   two day delivery or one day, not sure, I'm getting one sent to me now as I 
   am writing this. If I were you, I would pick Federal Express, its quicker 
   and safer. You MUST STAY IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY UNTILL FEDERAL EXPRESS 
   DELIVERS OR UPS!! If you are not home for Federal Express, they will leave 
   a note on your door, you can just sign it and put where you want them to 
   deliver it the next day when they come by again. I'm not sure if this will 
   be the case when you order 3 gigs, I don't know. That's what happened when 
   I order something and I wasn't home. The most important thing is to make 
   sure that the house looks LIVEABLE!! The next step is ordering..


5) Now go back down to the old pay phone, but before this look in your 
computer shopper and order what you want. Start asking about a lot of things 
so they aren't suspicious, then order the thing you want. Get Federal Express 
or whatever but no matter what you have to sign the paper no matter what. 
Give the address of your drop house and do not give any real info except the 
credit card number. Now use numbers 1 to 29 that you generated, skip around. 
If you want two things, then call up two different companies and use two 
different credit card numbers. Also it would be a good idea to get another 
drop house for the second order and use two different names. All of this 
should work, but just be very, very carefull, remember the true carder 
cannot be caught!


And with this I will leave you, may your days be carding days and all your 
orders come in!

Section 4... Good Pranx!!                        
                        
                                Good Pranks
                                By FlapJack

Again, these texts are only meant to be entertaining and/or educational. 
The members of HAVOK and I are not responsible for your actions taken in 
this matter.

Here's my tutorial on good prank calls, you can use Dr. Sbaitso for beginners or voice calls for experts.

                        Pay Phone Pranks
Here's a simple prank you can play with on the pay phone. Dial 991-XXXX  (Not 
911!!!!) XXXX means the last four digits of the pay phone's number. Dial this 
and you will get a dial tone, hang it up then pick it up no more than 1 
second later, you should now hear a beeping noise. Now hang it up this last 
time and run and hide in the bushes and wait for some fool to take the bait. 
The phone will then ring and someone will pick it up and hear nothing but a 
faint sound of the beep. Keep doing this and it will piss off a lot of people, 
it worked with all the rich snots at a yacht club I went to with my neighbors. 
This one fat old lady was cursing the damn phone! 
                        
                        Targets for Pranks
Here are some great crank calls: I obatined all their info by pretending to 
be some guy from a survey!!

James and Gwen Summers
888-FART or 888-3278
25 Hogsback Road, Oxford CT
The guys sounds retarded but he's really 74, the wife is 82 and very very 
old and stupid, she'll believe anything.

Somelady (I never got her name)
888-2633
She's a real bitch just bug the hell out of her!!

Nick LoCicero (one of the fat nerds at my school)
888-9196
Just bug the hell out of him, you have to hear the answering machine!!

Tom Sadowski (another geek)
888-2615
Just call him MEAT, it's a long story but bug him to hell also or just talk 
to his dad and say that you are a parent of one of his friends at school, 
don't give the name, just say that Tom is gay and has been doing strange 
things to your son!! It really bad but who cares!!!

Finally the best of them all:
   Berneice Spivak (Ber-neece Spee-vack)
    59 Swan Avenue, Seymour
   888-2989
BTW she talks like a man!!!
Let me tell you a little about her, she is an aide at my old middle school. 
We call her torpedo tits and the turkey woman. She has an Adam's apple that 
sags down a lot!! She also has such big tits she practically trips over them 
walking up the stairs!! My friends and I always call 1-800-COLLECT and she 
picks up. She's about 57 or so, what she doesn't know is that 1-800-COLLECT 
doesn't deal with operators, only recordings, so she says, "Operator, 
operator trace this call... (then she says) ahh you little shits you think 
this is funny don't you... (then her husband says who is this, in the 
background) Its those dumb ass kids again!!!"
If you think that's nothing, that's only the beginning, my friends and I 
once ordered a $1000 parrot for her and just the other day we had about 3 
exterminators go to her house and spray the outside when she was at work, 
but the best thing is that she has to pay for it!!! Her husband also says, 
"Why don't you cut out this God damned shit!!" They get really pissed but 
its really funny. Her car is a humongus bomb!! I think it needs some 
thermite!!! This is the best number to call!!! Try it out..

You should also do random crank calling at about midnight and say you are a 
servay company, most people believe you. BTW some phone numbers cannot be 
found with caller id, like 888 numbers for some reason... 

Call Video Stores and reserve for Berneice.
Also try this pizza places number, they never call back to make sure the 
number is real and order Berneice some pizza's (hehehehehe hahahaha) 
Its called Good Pizza
732-8107
The guy had a bad accent so listen carefully!

For pet stores call:
Fur N' Feather - 735-9991
Tropical Pets - 735-9339
Statewide Pets - 795-9931

For video stores call:
888-2505 (not 2525, that's the cops!!) - Spectrum Video - ask for dirty 
movies for Berneice

For exterminators call:
Bug Busters - 734-8545
and many, many more

Just take out the ol' Yellow Pages!!! Use your creativity for crank calls.
It's fun and really pisses people off.

Section 5... Hacking AOL                           

                           Hacking AOL
                          By: Dysphunxion

OK.. We all Know AOL is lame as All Fuck..  but hey.. some people aren't 
talented enough to hack a real service..  (sorry Nasty Nas Had to say it man)
If you want a real service read my info on Delphi..  Well AOL doesn't even
Have internet setup yet so that's part of why it sux..  and plus you can go
into the hacking chat room expecting to trade with people and only get ripped
off..  One good thing AOL does have However is the INTERNET Mail..  giving
you at least an internet Mail Address..  Heres some good tricks for the lame
ass's on AOL!!


                        Grabbing Random IM's.. 
Here's an Amerika Online trick.. This Requires AOL for Windows..


1) Send Yourself an Instant Message. (it will be refered to as IM from 
now on)

2) Upon Recieving it.. click on respond..  Hold Alt and type 0128 on 
Your KEYPAD!!  THIS IS IMPORTANT..  IT MUST BE ON YOUR KEYPAD.. You
Should see a little Square..

3) Press <TaB> then press Space..

4) If it comes up with a blank line..  than keep tryin.. 
until you get stuff..


                            AOL Text Manipulation..

Here is a simple Text Manipulation Trick for Windows America Online..

1) Using your mouse, highlight three lines of text in the chat room..  Make
sure that all three lines have been said by different people, and that you
also highlight their screen names!  

2) Go to the edit bar, and select copy.  

3) After that, Click your mouse on the spot where you write what you want
to say...  

4) Then go back up to the edit bar, and click paste.  All of the text
that you have highlighted should show up where you type in what you want to
say.  

5) Find the screen name that has 2 little sqaures in front of it, and
1 behind it.  Delete everything, except that and the colon in-between them.

6) Once you've done that, type what you want to say after the squares, and 
type the persons screen name for who you want to say it in side the squares.  

7) Just send it, and it should work...  It might take a little practice, It 
did for me.....  


                   Downloading and Chatting at the same time
OK.. AOL Sux.. as i said before.. :)    so you can Download from they're large
Shareware selection..  (why would you do that) or from what you have gotten         
from hackers on AOL..  (if they actually trade)..  This to Requires Windows..

1) Open your Chat room Window.. and goto the Room you wanna be in...

2) Start your download..  and move the download window into the bottom corner
until you can just barely see how much time is left..

3) Press ALT-TAB.. This will bring you to the Windows Program Manager.. 

4) Select File and select Exit..  This will ask you  OK or CANCEL.. click on
OK..  (don't worry it won't exit)

5) next it'll show your AOL window and Say  "Sign off)  than YES, NO or EXIT..

6) select NO then click on yer Chat Window and Chat Away..  If it locks up at 
all than just do it again..  

Well as you can see Windows AOL has LOTS OF FLAWS!!!   well this will help 
anyone hacking AOL or PAYING FOR IT..  (it really ain't worth it)

                                 Intro
   Ok here Is another phun file about how ta blow shit up. These are all 
   dangerous and will fuck ya up if ya don't do em right. A few of these ideas
   are borrowed from other files, but I didn't copy em down word fer word. 
   Hope ya like it.


                         Flying Lighters
   Shit ya need:
     - 2 lighters
     - A knife or flat head screwdriver
  
  The first thing you want to do is take the little metal part off the top of
  the lighter with the knife or screwdriver (a dime will work fine). The next
  thing to do is take the flint and other little things out. The red button 
  proably won't come out though. Now make sure there is fuel left in the lighter.
  if there isn't any fuel it won't work. The more fuel the better. Now stand 
  the lighter ya wanna blow up strait so the top is up. Now light the top with 
  the other lighter and get away from it. You will first see fire shoot out of
  the top then it will blow up in a mushroom cloud and shoot the lighter about
  three to four feet.

                         Fertilizer Bomb
   Shit ya need
     - Newspaper
     - Fertilizer( the chemical kind)
     - Cotton
     - Diesel Fuel
  
  First make a pouch out of the newspaper and put some fertilizer in it. Then
  put the cotton on top of it. Soak the cotton with the disel. Before ya light 
  this bomb up ya might want to find somewhere to take shelter, or run real 
  fast. This will blow up and spread fire about 500 square feet. 

                         Paint Bomb
   Materials:
     - Can of Paint
     - Dry Ice

  Ta make a paint bomb, ya need a metal paint can with a refastenable lid. 
  make sure the the paint is a nice bright color like pink or purple. Or some 
  really groos color like pea green. now open the can and drop the dry ice in.
  Put the top back on the can and run like Hell!! The can will explode blowing  
  messy paint all over everything. If yer really pissed off at you're victim,
  put the can on his doorstep, knock on his door, and run the Fuck away!!!
  The asshole will be covered with Paint! Hahahahahaha!!

                         Co2 Bomb
   Shit ya need:
     - A Co2 cartridge
     - Black Powder
     - A fuse 
  
  Ok, First use up a Co2 cartridge by shootin it or whatever. Then make the 
  hole bigger with a nail. Then fill it up with black powder (from a shotgun
  shell) and pack it in really good by tapping the bottom of it on pavement
  or another hard surface. Now insert a fuse, use a good cannon fuse or a 
  fuse from an M-80. A fire cracker fuse will work if ya can run faster than a 
  bat outta Hell! Once it's lit run like a Mother Fucker! this bomb will blow
  lots of shit up, It will throw shrapnel all over and make a big mess!

                         Exploding Lightbulb
   Ya need the following:
     - A lightbulb (100 w)
     - Black Powder

  To make it do this:
         - Drill a small hole in the top of the buld near the threads.
         - carefully pour the blackpowder into the bulb so it touches the 
           filament
         - Put the bulb back in the lamp (make sure the lamp is off or you're 
           Fucked!!!)
         - Get the Hell out!

                         Campo Bomb
   Ingredients:
     - A large explosive like an M-80 or H-100
     - A cardboard cylindrical container like a Kool-Aid can
     - Several cans of Comet cleanser ( A-jax dosn't work)
     - A roll of Electrical tape
  
  This is a cool little bomb called the Campo Bomb. It's relatively safe and
  it's real fun. 
  To make it fill up the kool-aid can half way with the Comet. Then put a hole 
  in the can right in the middle. put the M-80 or whatever next to the hole, 
  and put the fuse through the hole. Now pour more Comet over the M-80 until
  it's to the top. Now put the lid on the can and put the tape on it. 

  When you light this run like Hell!! (unless you like to inhale Comet) When 
  this explodes it will make a huge green cloud that drifts & drifts. Have A
  Blast!

                         Conclusion

  Well I hope ya have fun with some this shit, Just don't let the cops catch
  ya doin any of this shit, or yer gonna see some comunity service. Bye for
  a now, I'll be back next time I'm bored.


SECTION 7...  PHUN WITH AERESOL!!                          
                          Phun with Aresol Kanz

     1. Disclaimer
     2. Intro
     3. Pelet gun
     4. Exploding kan
     5. Fountain o' Fire
     6. Rock
     7. Hammer
     8. Wrap Up

                                Intro
       If you've ever taken an aresol kan and put a lighter up to it and
       watched the fire come out, you'll love these new, and creative ideas.
       All of these methods can result in severe burns, or other painful 
       problems, so be careful.

   1. Pelet gun
       
      Supplies:
         aresol can
         pelet gun
         somethin ta hold the kan up
         candle or other flame

   First make sure yer can is flamable, do this by taking a lighter, 
 holding the can up to it then spraying it. If a long stream of fire
 shoots out, yer can is flamable. First take the can and prop it up on  
 the brick or whatever yer usin ta hold the can up with so that the bottom 
 of the can is on the ground. Now light the candle and put it so it's under
 the can, the flame should be touching the can. Now take yer pelet gun 
 (it should be Co2) then turn the Co2 up really high. get a few feet away 
 and shoot the can. This will puncture the can causing a spray of whatever's 
 in it to fly and hit the candle lighting up the gas. This will make a big 
 BANG when the fire goes into the can. once you puncture the can with a 
 pelet, get the HELL away!


   2. Exploding Kan      
   
      Supplies    
         aresol can                         
         bricks to hold can up                               
         leaves or sticks for a fire                        
         a lighter

 First set up the can ot the two brickes, so the bricks are on the ends of 
 the can, then put the leaves or stickes under the can between the bricks.                                         
 then light the leaves. It should look at this.
                   _______________
                  :  Can          :
                  :_______________:
                ____            ____
               :bri-:  /\ / \  :bri-:
               :ck  : /  \ \ \ :ck  :
               :____:  Fire    :____:
                
  after a while the fire will get the can to above the temp it can go to                               
  and the can will explode. This will take a while but when it finally 
  goes up it will be cool.


   3. Fountian o' Flame

      Supplies
         aresol can
         a brick
         leaves or sticks

  To do this put the leaves or sticks or whatever yer usin to build the fire
  and make a small fire with them. Then take the can and stand it up next to 
  the fire. finally lean the brick up to the can so it pushes the top down 
  spraying the can. make sure the hole is aimed at the fire. When the brick 
  pushes it down it will spray at the fire making a large stream of fire, this
  looks cool, and it will also proably melt a hole in the can and cause it to 
  blow up. The more stuff in the can the longer it will go.


   4. Rock
     
      Supplies
         aresol can
         a large rock
         fire

  For this one, build a fire and put the can on top of it. Then when the flames
  are all around the can throw the rock at it really hard. This will either 
  make a stream of fire come out the side, or it will make a large fire ball.


   5. Hammer

      Supplies
         can of spray paint                    
         Sledge Hammer

  This one can only be used with a can of spray paint or it won't do what ya                           
  want it to do. First ya put the can of spray paint on you're neighbors 
  lawn or next to his house. Then ya wack it with the sledge hammer. This will
  make a huge mess, and proably get on you, so wear old cloths. You should 
  also do this at night or you're victim will see you running away with paint
  all over you then see paint all over their house, and he's gonna be one
  mad motherfucker
  
  
                            Wrap Up
  Ok have fun with all of these new methods of blowing up an aresol can.
  you can use hair spray and WD-40 for all of these things, but try spray
  paint. Not only does it explode (it's pretty flameable) but it makes one 
  big ass mess. So try it on you're most hated neighbor's lawn, or driveway.
  Have Phun!

  Thanx to Jolly Green for helping me think of and test all these ideas.

SECTION 8..  FUN WITH CATS!!

Hello from Tyrant ......
Welcome to the 1st in a long line of anarchy text from your buds at HAVOK

RECOMMENDATION: If you are an animal lover don't read any further


1.   Fun with cats
        
        
     A) First things first WATCH OUT FOR CLAWS those really hurt.  Now for 
        the fun stuff.  Find a cat you hate, one that keeps pissing on your
        house or walking in your yard.  Catch it and put it in a pillow case 
        and swing it around like a sling.  Preferably into a wall.  
        
     B) Try burying a cat with it's head popping out of the ground.  Next find 
        your favorite lawnmower. You can figure out what to do.  
                     
     C) Try this, take a cat put it in a pool then hold it under water with a
        skimmer.  Awwww poor kitty got wet.  We'll just have to dry it off. 
        Use either your handy-dandy microwave or the dryer.  Either way you'll 
        have cooked cat for dinner.
                     
     D) Gee.... I wonder if cats like the taste of M-1000.  Well we'll just 
        have to find out.
                     
     E) A quick way to piss off the neghborhood ass hole. Every neghiborhood 
        has one.  Ours called the cops one time for skate boarding.  One day 
        while the neighborhood dogs are out, catch his cat. Then find those 
        good ol' dogs and watch the fur fly! 

     F) Find yer Favorite 'lil Kitty... Have Someone Hold it down.. While you
        take a pair of scissors and chop off all it's whiskers..  now put the 
        cat near a wall and watch him walk into it till he dies..  

SECTION 9... HACKING RENEGADE
                      
                      How To Hack Renegade BBS Systems
                             By Dysphunxion


Renegade is one of the more common bbs systems being used. Being a hack itself,
of Telegard, one can easily guess that there's a bug in it somewhere. A bug?
That's too small a word. This has missed all of our attention... Now you will
know... You can grab all the renegade data files, user data files, and the chat
logs.

What You Need:      A Renegade Mock Setup (If you wish to see the files good
                    A Renegade BBS To Hack (They must have the archive menu)

1) Dial your target Renegade BBS...

2) Logon.. I advise using a fake account and deleting the logs when you're done.

3) After you logon, make sure the sysop is not around. Check the messages, play
   some door games to make it look normal. Page the sysop to see if he's around.
   Note that this hack is done better at night, when the sysop is asleep.

4) When ready, goto the file menu.

5) In the file menu there is an option called "/A". This is the archive menu.
   This is where you will do your work on compressed files.. this is also where
   you will do your hacking.

6) From the archive menu, select "W", to work on a file.

7) Enter the name of the archive you wish to work on. (This can be any name,
   followed by the extension of the file. ".ZIP" is the best, and most systems
   support it. What you will be doing is adding the data files to a .zip file
   for later download.

8) Now you have to add files. You hit "A" to do this. When it prompts you for
   files, type "../../u*.dat". Next type "../../r*.dat". Finally type
   "../../*.log".

9) Now you have the data files and chat logs in the archive... You may now
   download the file which you have created...

10) Now here's how to view it. Set up a mock Renegade BBS.

11) Copy the renegade.dat to your main renegade directory and copy the user
    files to x:\renegade\data\, or whatever your renegade data directory is.

12) Start renegade using RENEGADE /L .. this loads it in local mode..

13) Goto the user setup and start writing down passwords... System
    passwords are found in the system config section... (So you can logon
    as the sysop--Note that to do so you will need his/her phone number,
    password, and the system password. You can look at the RENEGADE.DAT
    file with a lister and find parts of passwords as well.)


Section 10..  How to Hack Delphi
                        How to Hack Delphi
                          By Dysphunxion
Ok..  Delphi is another Lame ass online service..  But it's not half as lame 
as Amerika Online..  Delphi However has FULL internet Services..
Including :             FTP <-File Transfer Protocol
                        IRC <-InterNet Relay Chat
                        Telnet
                        EMAIL
                        and More..

The Thing's you'll most be intrested in is IRC's and FTP's..  An IRC is a 
big ascii style live chat..  It's pretty quick and can handle hundreds of 
people on the same "Chat Channel"..  Some Basic Commands for IRC are:

/JOIN #<CH> <-this allows you to change to different Chat Rooms..
/Topic <New Topic> <-Changes topic
/Away <reason> <-Marks you as away and displays the reason to people..
/MSG <NAME> <MSG> <-sends a private message to <NAME>

Those are the basic commands.. /HELP shows more..  
Good Channels:          #Warez4
                        #ANSI
                        #Coders
                        #Virii

Play around with IRC.. It's lots of fun..  


FTP:   An FTP is a Internet File Transfer Protocol..  This allows you to
browse file libraries on other Computers (UNIX/VAX/SUN mainly)..  You can
find everything from Demos to Programming to Warez..  It's pretty much like 
an ordinary MS-Dos Computer..  You can use commands like CD and DIR..  Those 
will move you from place to place..  to Download a File (actually to your 
delphi workspace) you first get to the directory you want the files from
and type "BINARY".. This tells the Remote computer what type of file to send
Next you can "Get <FILENAME>" if you know the specific file name.. or if you
just wanna leech than you can always "MGET *.*"..  Mget is for Multiple get..
it tells the Unix/Vax/Whatever..  to get LOTS OF SHIT!!!   <G>


Good sites to FTP:      CS.UWP.EDU
                                \PUB\MSDOS\DEMOS
                        153.96.12.5
                                \in.coming\"..  "\MSDOS
                        Halcyon.COM
                                \PUB\Mirror\CUD

Well Have Phun on Delphi.. here's how you set up an account..

Section 11...  Sending a Car to Hell!!

              Our Favorite Ways To Send Cars To Hell
                        TYRANT<Havok>

I read a text like this in another bigger production so i said what the hell
the world can use another one if you've heard others than this E-Mail me on 
the following boards and they will be considered in following texts.

Gateway To Hell
Weird
NAM(i call this one just about every day)
Nuklear Wynter(this one too)since i can't spell here it's spelled TRYANT

This text is how to destroy a car many of you know some of these not all. Some
of the things in this text take a little bit of brains to do not a whole bunch
you just have to know your way around a car.

1)  If you've ever seen a m-1000 blow up you know what damage it can do well 
    well some cars actually run the exaust manifold close enough to the oil 
    pan. Sooo just tape your m-1000 to the oil pan and route the fuse to the 
    exaust manifold so when the car gets heated up it will light the fuse and
    BOOM a nice sized hole in the oil pan.
    
2)  A hole in the fule line is always nice to piss someone off. Just take a 
    nail to the fule line. Some gas might even make it to the hot part of the
    engine if you do it right BOOM heh.

3)  If you either know someone with a pool or have one yourself just take some
    of those chlorine tablets they. And antifreze don't mix. Put 'em in a 
    plastic bag and open up the dorks radiator. CAUTION HOT RAIDITORS DO HAVE
    PRESSURE BEHIND 'EM so wait till the car cools down or else your whole hand
    may be fairly burnt. Ok now that i warned all you morons just take the bag
    and put it into the raidiator with the plastic bag's opening facing the 
    top of the raidiator so no coolant gets into the bag if it does RUN.  So
    if your ok up until now all you have to do is close the top of the 
    radiator and go away. What it does is the radiato heats up and the bag 
    melts off the radiator leaving the chlorine tablets to dissolve into the 
    coolant. It then sets off some chemical reaction that i don't know the 
    details of all i know is it really blows up big and this can be real 
    hazadrous to an engine if it got inside it things like cracked cylinder
    walls and various other things if the explosion is big enough.

4)  This one only works on cars with drum brakes and it only has to be done
    to the lines. On the front wheels where is a rubber line to the wheel 
    cylinder just cut the rubber line not all the way through though just 
    deep enough to withstand a little pressure so when the person who drives 
    the car slams the brakes he won't be able to stop cuz all the pressure 
    will be gone flowing out the busted line. Now that's a little drastic for
    my liking but if you really hate the person just do it. It will probably
    kill him and most definetly kill the car.

5)  If your a complete moron and don't get out much heres a few of the more 
    common ones:
    Slashed Tires(simple but good if expensive tires)
    Mothballs in gas tank
    Egg in gas tank NOTE: this may not work on all cars just the ones with
                          the bigger slots in the funnel.
    Rubber Bands in gas tank 
    Just about anything in the gas tank that will fit
    Soaped tires
    Potatoe in the mufflers(you really gotta get it up there good use a broom
    stick or somethin)
   
6)  Take all the oil out of his car to do this just simply take a nail to the
    oil pan and just catch all the oil so no trace is left. The car will 
    probably start so just watch his house the next moring.

7)  If you want to see him destroy his own car just take a drill to the lock 
    and open up his door and lock it from the inside do it on bolth sides he 
    will probably have to smash the windows hehe.


Section 12...  MAKING LSD!!

                              Making LSD
                            By:Dysphunxion
        This is not an original text..  so don't think it's original.. it's
just my favorite thing.. ask anyone.. I'm a real ACID-Head.. Ask Tyrant..

         I think,  of  all the drugs on the black market today, LSD is
the strangest. It is the most recent major  drug  to  come  to life in the 
psychedelic subculture. (Blah blah blah... let's get to the good stuff: How 
to make it in your kitchen!!)

        1) Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby  Hawaiian
          wood rose seeds.
          
        2) In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
        
        3) Filter the solution through a tight screen.
        
        4) Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
        
        5)  For  two  days  allow  the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood
          alcohol.
          
        6) Filter the solution again, saving the liquid  and  labeling
          it "1."
        
        7)  Resoak  the  mush  in 110 cc.  of  wood  alcohol  for  two
          days.
        
        8) Filter and throw away the mush.
        
        9) Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled
          "1."
        
        10)  Pour  the  liquid  into  a  cookie  tray  and allow it to
          evaporate.
        
        11) When all of  the  liquid  has  evaporated,  a  yellow  gum
          remains. This should be scraped up and put into capsules.

               30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip
               15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip

Many  companies,  such as Northop-King have been coating their seeds with a 
toxic chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from a wholesaler, as it is 
much safer and cheaper.  Hawaiian wood rose seeds can be ordered directly 
from:
                Chong's Nursery and Flowers
                P.O. Box 2154
                Honolulu, Hawaii

          LSD DOSAGES
          -----------

The  basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid is available 
and what medium of ingestion is used. Chemically, the potency of LSD-25 is 
measured in micrograms, or  mics.  If you're  chemically  minded  or  making 
your  own  acid,  then computing the number of micrograms is very important.  
Usually between  500  and  800  mics  is  plenty  for  an 8 hour trip, 
depending on the quality of the acid, of course. I have heard of people 
taking as much as 1,500-2,000 mics. This is not only extremely dangerous, it 
is extremely wasteful. 
          
LSD  comes  packaged  in many different forms. The most common
are listed below:
        1) The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried  drop
           of  LSD  on it, is always around. Usually one spot equals
           one trip.
               
        2) Capsuled acid is very tricky, as the cap can be almost
           any color, size, or potency. Always ask what the acid  is
           cut  with,  as  a lot of acid is cut with either speed or
           strychnine. Also note dosage.
               
        3) Small white or colored  tablets  have  been  known  to
           contain acid, but, as with capsuled acid, it's impossible
           to tell potency, without asking.

Ok.. Most of this was from the Anarchist CookBook..  umm The Morning Glory 
seed can be gotten at a batgain store like Yankee Trader or Ocean-State 
Job Lot..  look around.. and if your having trouble finding petroleum ether
try starting fluid for a car.. as for the wood alcohol look in the hardware 
store for denatured spirits.. these work the same..  most people think it's 
the alcohol and ether that make you trip but actually the liquids make the 
seeds turn to a fungus and the fungus like reacts to yer brain or somethin..
at least that's what my dad says.. well just remember that ODin' SUX MAJORLY
Trust me..  :)  until next time this is Dys the Acidic one say  "Later dewd".
