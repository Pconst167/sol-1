    AUSTPAC GENERAL INFORMATION 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Charges : You can calculate your Austpac charges based on the 
following rates 
 
 Peak ( 8 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday ) : $4.95/hour 
 
 Off-peak ( all other times ) :           $3.95/hour. 
 
 A minimum call charge of $0.20 applies to cover your local 
call fee (which is charged to us) and the Austpac minimum time 
and data charges. 
 
 
 General info : AUSTPAC allows users to connect to T.A.B. 
cheaper that S.T.D. from anywhere in Australia. It is a 
"Packet Switched Data Service" designed specifically for 
computer or terminal data transfer over Telecom phone lines. 
A number of other services are available via Austpac and 
information on these can be obtained by ringing one of the 
following numbers :  
 
Head Office : (03) 606.7772 
 
  N.S.W.    : 267 6699 
  Victoria  : 605 6250 
  Queensland: 225 6400 
  South Aust: 225 7435 
  West. Aust: 420 7230 
  Tasmania  :  20 8800 
  A.C.T.    :  45 5555 
 
 
 "Packet Switching" can be defined as "the routing of data in 
discrete quantities called packets, each of controlled format 
and with a maximum size". 
 
 The service is implemented on a completely new network 
designed specifically to provide universal, shared, 
intelligent network for switched data communications. 
 
 A variety of conventional terminals, or computers emulating 
terminals, can communicate with us via a Telecom adaption 
facility called PAD (packet Assembly/Disassembly facility). 
The PAD controls the format and flow of data in both 
directions. 
 
 If you would like a copy of the Austpac "Asynchronous 
Character Data Terminal Users Guide" contact one of the above 
phone numbers. This will explain how to use Austpac correctly 
and also explains how to set your own parameters if the 
standard PAD Profile 7 does not suit your terminal/computer. 
 
 There are times when Austpac will not be available for 
general use due to maintenance and upgrading. These 
interruptions may occur at any time without notice, but the 
frequency of these interruptions should become less and less 
as the system is fine-tuned. 
 
 
 
 
 
    AUSTPAC LOGON INSTRUCTIONS 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 To connect to T.A.B. via Austpac, you should first establish 
a connection with the PAD (Austpac). The procedure for this is 
as follows : 
 
 300 BAUD : 
 
 1. Dial the Austpac number 01921. This number is available 
from any automatic telephone exchange in Australia. 
 
 2. When you get the carrier signal, connect your coupler or 
switch your modem to DATA. 
 
 3. Wait about 5 seconds, and then press H followed by 
carriage return (Note: all input at this stage must be in 
upper case only.) You should then get the message AUSTPAC, 
which indicates a successful connection has been made. If the 
word AUSTPAC appears on your screen prior to entering H, 
connection has already been made and this step is not 
necessary. This procedure identifies your baud rate to 
Austpac, as this phone number is for all terminals operating 
between 110 to 300 baud. 
 
 4. type PROF 7 (carriage return). This sets the PAD profile, 
or characteristics to the Austpac standard profile number 7, 
which is the profile most suited for connection to T.A.B. 
 
 5. You must then enter our identification code, which is 
?238220000 (carriage return). Note : the question mark IS 
required! After a short pause, the message COM should be 
returned and you will then get the T.A.B. logon message. 
Proceed as per normal from this point on. 
 
 1200/75 BAUD : 
 
 1. Dial 01923 instead of 01921. This is Austpacs'  Teletext 
facility which does provide the capabilities of connecting to 
us. You do NOT need to enter H for this connection, as the 
baud rate is fixed. 
 
 2. follow steps 4 to 6 (above) to connect to T.A.B. 
 
 
 If you have any difficulties at all, please write to username 
TAB on the system or call us on (03) 813.1133.

    AUSTPAC CODES INFORMATION 
    -------------------------------- 
The following codes are a few of the codes which may be 
returned by the PAD. They are usually in the format of: 
               CLR XXX nnn, 
where "XXX" equals the code and "nnn" is an I.D. number 
associated with that message. The I.D. number is only of use 
if it becomes necessary to inform us of the code received, 
whereapon you should give us the complete code received. 
 
 
    CLR DER 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 This error is returned when our Austpac link is unavailable. 
Please call the T.A.B. Hotline number and leave a message. 
 
 
    CLR DTE 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 This code is returned when you have been disconnected by us 
after logoff or due to some other fault. If you get this 
message other than after logoff, please let us know. 
 
 
    CLR ERR 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 This error code is returned due to a procedure error cuased 
by the operator, e.g. incorrect format.  
 
 
    CLR INV 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 This error code is returned by an error in your TAB I.D. 
entry. Try again with the correct identification - ?238120000 
 
 
    CLR NC

    PAD PARAMETERS - GENERAL INFO. 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 This section describes each of the RELEVANT PAD parameters 
and how to set them for your particular terminal if required. 
Each menu item first notes the default setting (Profile 7) 
which is set when you type PROF 7 before connecting to T.A.B. 
 
 There are a number of standard "PROFILES" which can be set 
when using Austpac. These profiles differ according to the 
requirements of the user. The profile closest to that required 
with T.A.B. is profile number 7. However, because there are so 
many different terminal types being used, requirements may 
differ, particularly in the area of the delete character. 
 
 Therefore, we have created this section for the benefit of 
users who wish to alter the paramameters they work with. 
 
 All parameters can be altered prior to connecting to T.A.B. 
by use of the SET? command. Any number of parameters can be 
altered at one time. It should be noted that you can only 
issue up to three PAD commands prior to connecting to T.A.B. 
 
 Once connected to T.A.B. you can issue a command to the PAD 
to change any parameters. To do this, you must enter the "PAD 
RECALL" character (default is CTRL-P). Nothing will be 
displayed on the screen to prompt you at this stage. After 
issuing your PAD command, you will be automatically placed 
back into the T.A.B. system. 
 
 As usual, if you have any problems with this, please feel 
free to contact us on (03) 813.1133 during Melbourne business 
hours or send us a note via Electronic Mail to username TAB. 
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 1 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : DLE (CTRL-P) 
 
 This parameter allows a user to exit the "Data Transfer 
State" to the "Command State" to issue ONE PAD command. 
 
 Possible values are : 
 
 0 : No PAD RECALL character is defined. All characters sent 
from the users' terminal are forwarded to T.A.B as data, with 
full transparency. Note : when parameter 1 has a value of 0, 
the BREAK signal may be used for PAD recall if parameter 7 is 
set to value 8. 
 
 1 : (DLE or CTRL-P). 
 
 32 to 126 (decimal) : Decimal value of binary number representing the 
character to be interpreted as the PAD recall character. 
 
 After issuing the PAD recall, you are placed in the PAD 
COMMAND mode, and the NEXT set of characters sent by you are 
treated as PAD commands. There is no prompt from PAD at this 
point, unless you have parameter 6 (Indications) set to 5. 
This will result in a prompt of *. 
 
 If you have typed a line, but have not yet sent it through to 
T.A.B. by pressing carriage return, using the PAD recall 
character will send the data through. Therefore, if you use 
the delete key on this text AFTER altering a PAD parameter, it 
will have no effect, as the data will have already been 
transmitted. 
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 2 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : 1 (echo on) 
 
 This parameter specifies whether Austpac (PAD) echoes each 
character entered. Echo is usually only turned off when the 
user is in "half-duplex" mode, i.e. the characters typed are 
sent to the screen as well as through your acoustic coupler or 
modem. 
 
 If you can change your terminal program from full duplex to 
half duplex it can be used to check that what you type is 
being correctly received and interpreted by Austpac. 
 
 Possible values are : 
 
 0 : no echo 
 
 1 : echo enabled. 
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 3 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default Parameter in Profile 7 : 2 -  CR (carriage return) 
 
 When using Austpac, all data is stored by the PAD until the 
"Data Forwarding Signal" is received. Then the information 
stored by the PAD is sent through to us. The standard 
preferred data forwarding signal is CR (carriage return), but 
the other possibilities are : 
 
 0 : no data forwarding signal. 
 
 2 : data forwarding signal is carriage return (CR). 
 
 6 : <CR> <ESC> <BEL> <ENQ> and <ACK> are all data forwarding 
signals. 
 
 18: <CR> <EOT> and <ETX> are data forwarding signals. 
 
 126: All non-printing characters (including DEL) are data 
forwarding signals. 
These characters are : NUL, SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK, BEL, 
BS, HT, LF, VT, FF, CR, SO, SI, DLE, DC1, DC2, DC3, DC4, NAK, 
SYN, ETB, CAN, EM, SUB, ESC, FS, GS, RS, US 
 
 Note 1 : when parameter 3=126, editing characters (including 
delete) should be selected from the non-printing characters 
listed above, to avoid conflict of use. 
 
 Note 2 : The data forwarding signal is included in the data 
sent through to T.A.B. and is the last character in each 
"packet". 
 
 Note 3 : Other conditions which cause data to be sent to 
T.A.B. from PAD are :  
 
 A full PAD buffer (packet) of up to 128 characters, providing 
this data does not include a data forwarding signal. 
 
 Receipt of a BREAK signal. 
 
 Escape to PAD Command mode. 
 
 Receipt of PAD messages (i.e. from Austpac, not T.A.B.) 
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 5 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : 1 
 
 Possible values are : 
 
 0 : The PAD does not generate X-ON & X-OFF characters. 
 
 1 : The PAD uses X-ON and X-OFF for flow control. 
 
 In certain circumstances, for reasons of flow control the PAD 
may be momentarily unable to transmit data to the correspondent, 
and if parameter 5 is not zero, the PAD will send to the 
users' terminal/computer an X-OFF character (CTRL-S). The 
users' terminal should then cease to transmit characters. 
 
 To indicate that it is able to accept further characters, the 
PAD will then send the user an X-ON character. 
 
 In particular, the PAD will send an X-OFF character under the 
following conditions : 
 
 
 1. Providing parameter 1 (PAD recall) is not zero, when the 
user sends the PAD recall character, which causes the PAD to 
stop transferring data and expect a command. 
 
 2. Provided parameter 6 (PAD service signals) is not zero, 
when an indication or answer has to be transmitted to the PAD> 
 
 The PAD always transmits an X-ON each time it first connects 
to T.A.B.  
 
 Note : X-ON = DC1    X-OFF = DC3 
 
 NOTE : If you wish to upload or download, then this parameter 
should be set to 0 prior to this operation. 
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 6 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : 1 
 
 Possible values are : 
 
 0 : The PAD does not transmit any messages or indications to 
the users' terminal. Instead, the PAD behaves exactly as if it 
had just transmitted the indication. The users' terminal will 
receive no information about call progress, resets, etc. Care 
should be exercised in setting parameter 6=0 if interaction is 
required. T.A.B. recommends that you do not use this setting. 
 
 1 : The PAD transmits indications to the users' terminal, 
either in response to a command or to report an error. 
 
 5 : The PAD transmits indications (as for value 1) but also 
transmits the prompt PAD signal. It does this to indicate that 
it is waiting for input from the user. 
 
 The prompt signal is <CR> <LF> followed by a *  
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 7 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : 21 (DISC, INT, BRK) 
 
 When a BREAK is entered from a terminal, it results in a 
physical break on the communications line. 
 
 Possible values are : 
 
 0 : No action taken. 
 
 1 : INTERRUPT 
 
 2 : RESET 
 
 8 : Escape from Data Transfer. 
 
 21: Interrupt, Indication of break PAD message, and discard 
data.  
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 9 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : 4 
 
 possible values are : 
 
 0 : no padding after carriage return. 
 
 n : ("n" = 1 to 7 - inserts 1 to 7 "NULLS" after carriage 
return).  
 
 This parameter specifies whether the PAD should transmit 
NULLS after it transmits a carriage return to the users' 
terminal. This is particularly useful if the user is using a 
hardcopy terminal or has a slow printer "chained" to his 
micro/terminal to copy all data received to paper. It operates 
the same way as the T.A.B. PAD command. It is used to ensure 
that characters are not sent when the mechanical device is 
being returned to the left hand margin of the printer/hardcopy 
terminal. Padding may be non-printing characters or time-fill. 
 
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 12 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : 1 
 
 This parameter detirmines whether the users' terminal can 
control the flow of data to and from the PAD by use of X-ON 
and X-OFF characters (CTRL-S & CTRL-Q). 
 
 Possible values are : 
 
 0 : The PAD regards X-ON and X-OFF characters as data 
characters, and as such does not act on them when received. 
 
 1: The PAD interrupts the transmission of data to the users' 
terminal when it receives an X-OFF character. This X-OFF state 
remains until the PAD receives an X-ON character from the 
terminal, or until the PAD Recall character is received. 
 
 NOTE : If you wish to UPLOAD (SAVE) or DOWNLOAD, then this 
parameter should be set to 0 prior to this operation. 
 
 
    PAD PARAMETER 16 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 Default parameter in Profile 7 : 8 (BS or Backspace). 
 
 Possible values are : 
 
 0 to 127 (decimal) : the decimal value of a character is to 
be used as the "character delete character". This is the most 
common delete character used, but some terminals/computers may 
require the use of ASCII 127 (delete). 
 
 Users  Users should set both their PAD parameter 16 and their 
T.A.B. DELCHR to the same value. 
 
 
 
 
 
    AUSTPAC PHONE CONNECTIONS 
    -------------------------------- 
 
 If your modem does not have a phone attached, your telephone 
hookup should be as per Telecoms' Mode 3 connection. This is 
outlined for your information as follows, although Telecom can 
easily install this for you. Any other connection, particularly 
if there is more than one phone on the circuit, can result in 
attenuation of signal strength, which can result in "garbage" 
on line. 
 
 If you are using any other connection type and have more than 
one phone installed, you should unplug all unnecessary 
telephones. If you are using a "Y" connector, we suggest you 
unplug the telephone AFTER you have established contact with 
Austpac (i.e. received carrier tone).  
 
 Because the Austpac carrier is often weaker than a normal 
dial-up line, it is important that your receive and transmit 
sensitivity is as high as possible. Acoustic couplers should 
be adjusted to a level of -10dB. 
 
 For the 1200/75 b.p.s. service, the speed must be accurate to 
+1% and -2 1/2%.

 Basically, what the above diagram describes is as follows : 
 
 The incoming line goes to pins 2 and 6 on a Telecom 611 
socket. This must be the first socket in the circuit. Then run 
a pair from pins 1 and 5 of the same socket to pins 2 and 6 on 
a Telecom 610 socket. Any further telephone extensions can be 
paralleled to pins 2 and 6 and as many sockets as is required. 
It should be noted that when the modem is switched to data, 
ALL telephones in the circuit will be disabled. 
 
 
 
    AUSTPAC UPDATE 
    -------------------------------- 
AUSTPAC : If you have any difficulty with Austpac connection 
to us, please advise via Electronic Mail to TAB or via the 
hotline. All relevant information will be passed on to Telecom 
and Data General.  
 
WHO TO CALL 
 
If you are disconnected from the system when connecting via 
Austpac please call 1107 (free call), (N.S.W. users - (02) 
211.0711) ask for Austpac Division and report the problem. 
 
DELETE AND CLR DTE 
 
Austpac users please use your BACKSPACE key ONLY (ASCII 8) to 
delete characters until further notice. Do NOT use DELETE 
(ASCII 127). Also type SET?15:1 after you have typed PROF 7. 
Alternatively, after you have logged on, type CTRL-P SET?15:1. 
This will cut down the incidence of the CLR DTE 000 message! 
 
   NOTE - The TAB Austpac ID number is now ?238220000.
