          WHAT IS NETCRACK?

          NetCrack--the   Advanced  NetWare   Security  Cracker--is  a
          software  utility for use with  networks operating under the
          Novell   Advanced  NetWare  network  operating  system.  The
          NET$OS.EXE  file is patched so that the security information
          created  with  SYSCON is  disabled.  NetCrack  is compatible
          with  Advanced NetWare 86 and  Advanced NetWare 286 Versions
          1.00 through 2.15.


























































          HOW DOES NETCRACK WORK?

          NETCRACK  (TM)  installs  patches io the  NET$OS.EXE file to
          disable use of the security information created with SYSCON.
          Security  data is  maintained in the  files NET$BIND.SYS and
          NET$BVAL.SYS   located  in  SYS:SYSTEM.  NETCRACK  will  not
          damage  the existing security  files.  The original security
          may   be  restored   by  invoking   the  original  unpatched
          NET$OS.EXE.

          NETCRACK may be used to gain access to a fileserver when the
          SUPERVISOR  password is unknown.  It is  necessary to have a
          copy  of  NET$OS.EXE from  SYS:SYSTEM or  to generate  a new
          operating  system with the  correct driver set.  This backup
          copy  of  NET$OS.EXE is  the  target file  for  the NETCRACK
          utility.

          To  use  NETCRACK,   boot  DOS on  the  fileserver.  Execute
          NETCRACK.  Select  the  CRACK  option  from  the  menu  with
          the  backup  copy  of  NET$OS.EXE  as  the target.  CHECKSUM
          the  patched  operating  system.  Then  invoke  the  patched
          NET$OS.EXE  from  Drive  A:.  This  will  bring  up NetWare.
          LOGIN  as SUPERVISOR from  any workstation.  PASSWORD is not
          required.  The  NET$BIND.SYS and  NET$BVAL.SYS files  may be
          flagged  Read/Write  (RW)   and  deleted.  Then  invoke  the
          original  unpatched operating system,   login as SUPERVISOR,
          and setup new security with SYSCON.

          If  using NETGEN to  create a backup  operating system,  the
          NET$OS.EX1  and  NET$OS.EX2  files must  be  concatenated as
          follows:
                    COPY/B NET$OS.EX1+NET$OS.EX2 NET$OS.EXE

          If using NETGEN with high capacity diskettes,  NET$OS.EX1 is
          the target for NETCRACK.

          If you only have 360K diskette drives available, you may use
          the  program SPLIT to split your patched NET$OS.EXE into two
          pieces which will fit on 360K diskettes.

          NBS Tech Support (713) 781-9268.
