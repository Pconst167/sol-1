The writer wishes to thank the Institution of Production Engineers and
it's President for the invitation to make this presentation, and to
express sincere appreciation to David Stang, Ph.D., Director of Research,
National Computer Security Association, for his contribution both to this
paper and to computer security in general.  And I would be very remiss if
I neglected to mention the professional secretarial assistance provided by
Jane  Templeman, who makes our whole team tick like the NRC official time
clock - the one that gives the CBC time signal.

This document is, hopefully, written softly:  after all, it might be
easier to digest if I have to eat my words.  I do not profess to be "the
expert" in the field of computer security; an expert is someone who knows
more and more about less and less until s/he knows absolutely everything
about nothing.  I hope never to stop learning, which means (thankfully)
I'll never be an expert.

Tonight's topic is "Computer Security," a subject near and dear to my
heart after catching fraud a few times, and cracking system security a
few times.  The only unfortunate part of this evening is that I have
enough material to cover an intensive 2 or 3 day seminar and I only have
something over an hour, so in addition to extensive notes from this
presentation, I've put an article on viruses, and a PC virus detector
program on diskette for you.


1.   SCOPE OF COMPUTER SECURITY

Computer security relates to any potential loss of information or your
ability to operate, regardless of the source of the problem.  Of course,
all the publicity about computer security is going to the virus
situation.  I don't want to dissuade anyone from their concerns about
viruses, because it's definitely a growing problem, and if you get hit,
you'll be sorry you ever laid eyes on a computer.  But, current estimates
indicate that viruses represent only 3% of all the computer problems now
occurring.  Of course, if you're one of the 3%, like CNIB or Barclay's
Bank Canada were last fall, you'll feel like you're the only one on
earth.  The difference between viruses and other computer security issues
is apparently one of control:  I hope to convince you that you have as
much control over viruses and as little control over the other 97% of
problems as to make them equal threats to the safety of your computer.

I'm going to get to viruses later, their prevention, detection and cure,
but I'd like first like to cover the other major problems that affect
computer security - the other 97% - and I'd like to start with reasons
why you should be concerned about security.


2.   WHY SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED?

Your data is a valuable asset, just like premises, equipment, raw
materials and inventory.  Because so much of modern business depends on
computers - financial systems, engineering design, medical diagnosis,
production and safety control - the destructive potential is greater
every year.  There has been more than one company that's suffered great
losses, and even gone under because of the loss of things like their
accounts receivable records:  no one is going to pay you if you don't
send them a bill, and if they get word of your inability to invoice them,
their darned unlikely to volunteer payment - so you're in a financial
mess.  The same goes for your design information, production data, the
consequences if safety control systems malfunction, or even the simple
loss of your customer list.

Another reason why you should be concerned is, too often, people don't
think about computer security until it's too late.  There's a saying in
my industry that, "He who laughs last probably made a backup."  Another
saying is, "Experience is something you don't get until just after you
needed it the most."  Well, if it means the life of your company, or the
loss of potentially millions of dollars, or even just the information on
your home computer, it might be wise to get at least some basic knowledge
before the disaster strikes.











                                  - 3 -

3.   TYPES OF SECURITY BREACHES

Now that the 'why' is out of the way, let's break down the 97% of
problems.  These are not in a specific order, but just as they came to
me.  Nor have I attempted to attach percentages to each type of risk,
because very few computer crimes are actually reported, so any figures
that anyone could estimate would not be realistic:


FRAUD/THEFT
By far the biggest problem is fraud or theft.  Some examples of this are:

     CHAOS - 1987 - Hamburg  ->  NASA data bank info sold to USSR

     Foreign exchange              }    famous because of big $
     Electronic Funds Transfer     }    amounts, and because of the
     Insider Trading               }    publicity they've received

     Most common:  Cookie jar technique - e.g., interest, income tax
                   (aka 'Salami' technique - take a little and no one
                   will notice)

Specific examples I've caught were in Payroll (no crash on < or =),
Accounts Payable (dummy companies), Purchasing (failed reasonableness
test), and Accounts Receivable (failed balance routine).  These were all
thefts of money.

Another example of theft which is very interesting is the 28-year-old
Canadian who was arrested at UNISYS in Pittsburgh on Dec. 13/89 - what he
is alleged to have stolen was NCR's trade secrets - to the tune of
US$68M, which comes under a different Canadian law from monetary theft.



MALICIOUS DAMAGE / VANDALISM
The next major type of computer security breach is the disgruntled
employee syndrome.  Their favourite is the logic bomb or time bomb:  on a
certain date or condition after they leave the company, something's going
to happen, such as at the health centre in LA where all prescriptions
suddenly multiplied by 2.  That's really serious, even compared to the
logic bomb that superzaps all your files off the face of the earth,
because someone could die.  At least with a superzap, you can recover if
you've been backing up and have a disaster recovery plan in effect.  Pure
physical vandalism occurs more often at educational institutions, but is
still a serious threat.  I wouldn't let me near your machine if I was
angry with you - my vandalism would be difficult to detect (and expensive
to repair).  A simple application of a magnetized screwdriver ......



LACK OF SECURITY PLANNING IN SYSTEM DESIGN STAGE
One of the biggest logic bombs that's going to occur is on January 1/2000.

Do you know how many computer systems use a 2 digit number for the year? 
Do you know how much work it's going to be to adapt systems to recognize
00 as being greater than 99?  My grandmother was born in 1886, and most
systems show her birth year as 99.  If she lives to the year 1999, I
wonder if they'll start sending her the baby bonus.  This time bomb is not
malicious damage, it's pure lack of planning at the system design stage. 






                                  - 4 -

(Lack of Security Planning - continued)

Things like balance checks and reasonableness tests are not built into the
system from the beginning, and it's not easy to put them in later.  Users
must participate at the system design stage, because only they know what's
reasonable and what can be balanced.  Don't expect a computer technician
to know everything there is to know about your job.




DISTORTED SENSE OF HUMOUR
Then there's the practical joker - the one who thinks it's funny to break
into the system to see what he can change, or create some dumb message to
appear on your screen.  That's what happened at IBM when the infamous
Christmas tree appeared 2 years ago (1987).  The joke was three-fold  -
first it analyzed your electronic mail distribution lists and reproduced
itself to send to everyone you normally send messages to - this clogged
the system up with people reading more messages than normal.  The second
part was a little more technical - everyone who read the message caused a
separate load of the offending program to take up space in memory, unlike
most systems where two or more people who are doing the same thing are
sharing one load of the software.  This clogged memory up so that nothing
else could run.  There was one more part to this:  there were delay timers
built into the program so it deliberately ran very slowly.  The result was
that the largest computer network in the world was shut down for 4 hours. 
Someone must have had a great need for a power trip.



MISTAKE
Next, there's fumble fingers:  you know, the one who keys the formula in
as 600 grams instead of 60 grams, or the estimated production time of 2
hours instead of 2 days.  Or the one who almost took me into court when
he blamed "the computer" for a mistake.  Without going into details about
that incident, I can say that going through the grilling by several
lawyers in a preliminary investigation was not the high point of my
career.  What saved the situation (for me and the organization) was audit
trailing:  every time a transaction was entered, the system recorded the
terminal i.d., the user i.d., the date and the time.  It also saved a copy
of the record as it existed prior to the transaction taking place.  A more
common mistake, though, is to unlatch a diskette door before the light
goes out.  Few people realize that the FAT (file attributes table) is the
last thing written on a disk, and you can corrupt the FAT by removing the
disk too early.


"EVERYONE DOES IT" SYNDROME
Then there's everyone's favourite:  copying software.  Believe it or not,
in Canada, that falls under the Copyright law, not under theft, but it
has been successfully prosecuted.  Even if you reverse engineer it and
make some minor changes, it will come under the "look and feel" test of
the Copyright law - if it looks and feels the same as the original, you
can be prosecuted.  Copying software is illegal, and your company as the
registered owner could be held liable if it is detected.








                                  - 5 -

ILLEGAL ACCESS
Many major computer crimes are perpetrated by illegal access:  the 14-
year old who broke into NASA from his basement computer room is just one
example.  There is password software on all larger machines, and it's not
difficult to put it on PCs.  On the larger machines, one of the major
problems is not changing the standard passwords that are set when the
machine is delivered:  the standard user-level password may be USER, the
standard operator password may be OPERATOR, and the standard field repair
person's password may be REPAIR, and so on.  Guess how I've cracked
security a couple of times.  In a 1988 article by Dr. Cliff Stoll in
"Computers and Security,", he reported that in 10 months of systematic
testing on computers attached to the US Defense Data Network (Milnet),
access was gained in 13% of the attempts simply by guessing at passwords!

There should be some rules applied to passwords:  not less than 7 or 8
characters,  must be changed at least every 60 days,  don't use common
things like names (another way I've broken security), don't share it
under any circumstances and, for heaven's sake, don't post it on the
front of your machine or leave it where someone can find it.  It's your
personal PIN - just like the money machine - and the information you're
dealing with is worth money.  Some of the most difficult passwords to
break (take it from me) are "two words reversed" (e.g., boardwall,
hornshoe, cuptea), or foreign language words (e.g., coupdegrace,
millegrazie, caliente).  Nonsense is good, too:  geebleurql is nice. 

If you're installing password security on a PC, consider whether you
should have it so tight that there is no recourse to the DOS level or no
ability to boot from the A: drive.  You'd need really good password
software (or a good technician on staff) if you have both of these
facilities - otherwise you can lock yourself out - but it's my preference
(especially for the guy who's wiped his root directory twice).


PHYSICAL SECURITY
Finally, another area that affects computer security or your ability to
carry on computer operations, and one that is often overlooked, is simple
physical security:  keys, thermal shock, vibration, dirt, water, fire,
visibility of information, steady power supply, discharge of static
electricity, magnetic fields, are all relevant to security.  We have one
man in our network who should have (a) cabling bolted to his computer and
the floor, (b) a key to his unit, and (c) dust protectors (as well as
password access only without recourse to the DOS level).  

When it comes to thermal shock, if you work in an area where the heat is
reduced on winter weekends, I strongly recommend you leave your unit
running over the weekend - just lock the keyboard.  If the air
conditioning is shut down, turn your unit off, and don't turn it on until
the temperature is  23C or less.  And please don't leave your machine
sitting in the sun, or in front of an open window to attract dust.  The
internal temperature raises within 20 mins. or so to >30C, and the effects
of thermal shock are such that it can, first, rock memory chips out of
their sockets, and, worse, misalign the read heads on your disk drive so
that nothing can be read.











                                  - 6 -

(Physical Security - continued)

Vibration, too, is a source of problems, especially for drives.  The read
heads actually float over the surface of drives, not on them the way a
record player needle does, and the space tolerance between is measured in
Angstroms (metric version of microinches).  Vibration can cause the head
to hit the drive, and you can say goodbye to whatever was written there.

If you're in a particularly sensitive field, and your information is what
might be called top secret to your company, you might also want to look
at two protection devices:  one is encryption, and the other is Tempest
hardware or shielding.  Encryption involves translating your data using
algorithms to something unreadable, and de-coding it when you need it.  It
uses a "key" to choose the algorithm - dont' lose the key!  It comes in a
few forms:  software controlled encryption, hardware based encryption, or
a combination of the two.  Most encryptors work with standard algorithms,
but defense departments and other high-security installations prefer
random algorithms.    Tempest hardware, or shielding, protects against
sniffing of signals. ( Signal emanation surveillance is called
"sniffing.")  I don't have a computer here to demonstrate this, but if
you take an old battery-operated transistor radio and set the dial to the
bottom of the AM band around 520, try passing it within a foot of your
computer.  Your ear might not pick up the individual signals, but I assure
you there's equipment that does.  That's why the US Army was blasting rock
music around the Vatican Embassy when Noriega was there - to mask signals.

More important to the average user, though, is avoidance of electro-
magnetic fields (such as ringing phones near a disk or disk drive), and
having an automatic disk head 'parker' that moves the heads to a safe zone
every few seconds.  That way, something like a brief power failure is less
likely to cause a "head crash" on the disk.

Simple visibility of information is a risk.  Recently I went to a bank
with a court order in hand to give me access to an account.  The clerk
simply turned the terminal toward me and, if I'd wanted to bother, I could
have had the account numbers of two other people with identical names. 
There is screen saving software that will blank your screen after an
inactivity duration you choose, and personnel should be made conscious
that unauthorized viewing of information is a security risk.  And watch
what your staff throw out on paper, too.

When it comes to fire and water, there are two basic rules that everyone
can follow:  first, don't smoke around the PC, and second, don't feed the
PC coffee and donuts.  You might be able to save a keyboard or some parts
with a bath in distilled water, possibly followed by drying with a warm
hair dryer, but there's no guarantee.  I prefer pure isopropyl alcohol -
without the hairdryer so I don't get fried in the process.  Don't blast a
computer with a fire extinguisher if you can avoid it.  If you do have a
fire or a flood, though, you'd better have a tested disaster recovery
plan, and your backups stored off-site.


All of these issues are reasonably within your control:  fraud, theft,
disgruntled employees, practical jokers, fumble fingers, software copying
and physical security, at least as much as the infamous viruses that are
around, but let's take a look at why you're at risk.

4.   REASONS FOR EXPOSURE

Concentration of data in one place

Instantaneous adjustment

Alteration without a trace

Lack of visible records

Complexity of the system

Networking

Technical persons can befuddle

General ignorance by non-techie and management

Detection problems

Lack of training

Security checks in programs not specified

Systems not documented

Limited staff resource for programming/management

No separation of duties

Possibility of enormous losses remaining undetected

Reluctance to report -   Embarrassment
                         Lack of sufficient evidence to prosecute
                         Cost to prosecute outweighs recovery
                         Company policy ("Press would have a field day")

6.   VIRUSES

As in medicine, a virus needs an 'organism' to which it may attach itself,
and a virus is 'contagious'.  

In the case of computers, a virus is usually a destructive piece of code
which attaches to a working program, such as your word processor,
spreadsheet or CAD/CAM software.  Viruses are usually written to detect
any load of a computer file that has an extension of .EXE, .COM, .OVL,
.BIN - such extensions representing executable programs.  Often, the
virus loads itself into memory, then loads the program you just called, so
the virus is sitting at the front.  Then when you exit the program, the
virus code calls for the re-writing of the program back onto the disk -
with the virus still sitting at the front.  Other viruses simply go
straight into your boot sector, so they get loaded every time you turn on
your machine.  Some do both.  

However they 'hide', and whatever they attach to, they got to your machine
on an infected diskette.  If you are infected and then copy your software
to use on another machine, guess what happens?  Right!  That's where the
'contagious' element comes in.

In 1989, more viruses were discovered than in all previous years.  There
were over 110 at the end of the year, and 7 were discovered in December
alone.  Sources have been from as far away as Pakistan and Bulgaria.

Only .004% have reported infections, but most are not reported.  Consider
this:  if only 1% were infected, that would be 1/2 million units in the
U.S. alone.  At a cost ranging from $300 to $3,000 per unit to recover,
the problem starts to impact the economy as well as the productivity of
staff at your organization.  It cost one Texas company US$10M to shut
down their 3,000-unit network for 4 days to find 35 infected units.

One of the major problems with viruses is that 90% of the users who
recover are re-infected within 30 days.  One person at my organization
was re-infected 7 times in 2 months!   Most reinfections occur for one of
two reasons (not necessarily in this order):  your back-up was infected,
or it was a virus that hid in the boot sector on track 0, and track 0 is
not re-written by the standard "FORMAT" command (only a low-level format
will get rid of a track 0 virus).  Be careful of some new software as
well:  there has been more than one instance of shrink-wrapped software
being infected (software companies have disgruntled employees, too, it
seems).

6.9  VIRUS DETECTOR AND ANTIDOTE SOFTWARE

          *** None offer complete protection ***

Some do NOT test for boot sector viruses, modification of the command
interpreter, branching into the BIOS, etc., unconventional things that
nasty viruses are known to do.  This is not a comprehensive list, but
you'll have an idea of what's available, either commercially or through
public domain.  Look for a product that will detect as many of the
effects identified in the previous section as possible.  Warning:  some
highly publicized virus detectors only search for ONE (1) virus!  Others
are more sophisticated, and may even act as a disinfector as well as a
detector.

Disk Defender * recommended (add-on board - write-protects hard disk)

Shareware:   Novirus
             Flushot4+
             Virusck
             Viruscan

Plus what's shown on preceding pages as a "Disinfector that works".  I
also have a list of over 100 shareware products that do everything from
detect and/or disinfect to write-protecting the hard drive and requiring
password access .... but my fingers are getting tired from typing at this
point, and there are more important things to cover - after all, if
you're careful, you won't need a list of detectors/disinfectors.

6.10  TROJAN HORSES

While a "virus" is something hidden within another program that is
waiting to make your system really sick, and a "worm" may be something
that lives on its own and usually transmits through networked computers, 
a "Trojan Horse" is a little of both, so I've included it with this virus
section if only to warn you of its existence.  It lives on its own as a
program, and will bring you down like Helen of Troy's soldiers.  "I
wouldn't copy something like that," you say.  Well, like Helen's horse,
it comes disguised.  It will purport to do something really neat, like
compress files (so you have more disk space available), sort your
directories (so you can find things more easily), or play chess or
another game with you.  In actuality, it's really just waiting to do the
things that viruses do - trash your files, scramble your boot sector, fry
your FAT, or erase your hard disk.  It doesn't usually do anything it
promises to do.

The following are just a few examples of the known Trojan Horses, most
of which come from bulletin boards.  Please don't misunderstand me, most
BB operators are honest people who are trying to help the computer
industry as a whole, but they can't be held responsible for the people
who might dial into their BB and leave a disaster waiting until the next
caller(s).


SCRNSAVE.COM:  This is supposed to blank your screen after x seconds of
               inactivity, thus preventing image burn-in or apparently
               offering a sense of security;  say goodbye to your files
               while it erases your harddisk.

TSRMAP:        For the 'sophisticated' user who uses Terminate and Stay
               Resident programs, it's sometimes handy to have a map of
               where these programs are loaded in memory, and be able to
               delete some if you're short of memory;  hopefully this
               same 'sophisticated' user has a copy of track 0, because
               his was just sent to heaven ..... or elsewhere.

DOS-HELP:      Sounds great, doesn't it?  This TSR program is supposed to
               give on-line help on DOS commands.  Your hard disk was
               just formatted.

ULTIMATE.EXE:  This is supposed to be a DOS shell (if you've used
               Directory Scanner or some other software that allows you
               to move around directories and load programs easily, or
               even a menu system, then you know what a DOS shell is). 
               While the "Loading..." message shows on your screen, the
               FAT (file allocation table) of your hard disk went to the
               trash bin.

BARDTALE.ZIP   This purports to be a commercial game from Electronic Arts
               (BARDTALE I)  Someone reverse engineered this program, and
               wrote in a routine to format your hard disk upon
               invocation.











                                 - 21 -

COMPRESS.ARC   This is dated April 1 1987, is executed from a file named
               RUN-ME.BAT, and is advertised as "shareware from Borland"
               (Borland is a highly reputable company).  It will not
               compress your files, but it will very competently destroy
               your FAT table.


DANCERS.BAS    You'll actually see some animated dancers in colour -
               while your FAT is being tromped on.

DEFENDER.ARC   Think you're going to get a copy of Atari's DEFENDER for
               nothing, huh?  There's still no such thing as a free
               lunch, and this one will be particularly expensive:  it
               not only formats your hard disk, but it writes itself to
               your ROM BIOS - the chip that holds the Basic Input Output
               System for your machine.  Get your wallet out.

SIDEWAYS.COM   The good "SIDEWAYS.EXE" is about 30Kb, while this version
               is about 3Kb.  The really big difference, though, is what
               happens to your hard drive - it's spun off into oblivion.


These are only a few of the 70 or so Trojans I have listed at work, but
I'm sure you've got the idea.  These programs (a) stand alone, (b) often
claim to do something useful, (c) may be hacked versions of good
software, (d) may be named the same as good software, (e) may send you
back to using a quill pen.

7.   PC RULES OF THUMB  (Additional to Basic Rules of Thumb)

Run virus check BEFORE backup

Boot floppy systems from known, protected disks only

Never work with masters - first make copies on a trusted machine

Store data on floppy:
     set path in autoexec.bat, but load from A: to 
     ensure data goes to floppy

Save your data periodically while working

Use write protect tabs

Use write protect software on hard disk / backup track 0

Never boot HD systems from floppies (unless known and
     protected)

New/repaired hard disk? - run a virus detector

Use protection package (practice safe hex)

Avoid shareware / BB demos
     if you use a BB, set path to A: beforehand,
     download only to A:, poweroff immediately after,
     then powerup and do a virus scan on the floppy;
     always scan shareware

Know the source of your software

Don't use illegal copies

If your data is truly confidential, don't depend on
     DELETE - you must use, e.g., Wipefile

Autopark software

Hardcards























                                 - 23 -

6.   A FEW EASY TRICKS FOR PC SECURITY


1.   Set Read only attributes on all files ending with .COM, .EXE, .SYS,
     . OVL,  .BIN,  .BAT

          e.g.:     ATTRIB +R *.SYS



2.   Use an undocumented trick in DOS of naming your data files ending
     with an ASCII blank or NUL character (ASCII 32 or 255): ***

          e.g.:     COPY  A:OLDFILE.TXT  NEWFILECHR$(255).TXT
              or    REN  A:MYFILE.DAT  MYFILECHR$(32).DAT

     ***  Newer versions of DOS will give the ASCII blank or null by
          holding the [Alt] key and striking the numeric keypad numbers;
          e.g.  COPY  A:OLDFILE.TXT  NEWFILE[Alt]255



3.   Prevent inadvertent formatting of the hard disk:

          Rename FORMAT.EXE to (e.g.) DANGER.EXE
          Write a 1-line batch file called FORMAT.BAT:
               DANGER A: %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6


4.   Have a batch program as a shutdown routine, to run:

          1. Virus Check
          2. Copy Track 0
          3. Back up your data files
          4. Park the heads





























                                 - 24 -

9.   SO YOU'RE INFECTED


Terminate all connections with other computers

Record your last activities

Determine the nature and extent of the damage

Notify other users

Contact the source of the carrier software

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 


Back up data files to new diskettes

Erase infected disk (using high or low level format -
     low level is preferred to re-write track 0)

Check master disks with detection program(s)

Restore system files

Restore data files

Run detection program(s) again

Be careful in future - think like a thief!

10.  SUMMARY:  WHAT CAN YOU DO?

There are many aspects to computer security, none of which are totally
within your control, but all of which are reasonably within your control. 
One of the major methods of getting control is to establish an
enforceable security policy AND a disaster recovery plan.  However, it's
almost impossible to establish a plan unless you first know what the
risks are.

WHEN YOU GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICE

Try putting some staff into two teams: "hackers" and "police" (or call
them Blue Jays and Cardinals if you find that offensive).  The role of
the hackers is to try to dream up all the things they could get from or
do to the company (or to a department) by breaking computer security. 
The role of the police is to respond with defenses.    Then switch roles.
List all the ideas, no matter how "far out" they seem, then use this for
the basis of risk analysis and disaster recovery planning.  The only rule
to this game is that no idea is initially rejected.

Now that you have some idea of the value of your data and the risks it is
under, you can begin to work on a "Computer Security Policy" and a
"Disaster Recovery Plan."  While many suggestions have been made on the
previous pages, recognize that not all risks/solutions apply to all
organizations:  you have to make some judgement calls based on your
assessment of the risk.  The judgement is based on how much loss you can 
comfortably sustain, yet remain in business.  The level of security
protection you require may not always be the same.  It may vary with the
value of the hardware, software or data under consideration;  the
security level, therefore, might be stated as "minimal," "discretionary,"
"mandatory," or "verified."  The point is, as long as it's been
considered, you're closer to having a good security system than if you
have no policy or a policy that's based on guesswork.

You may find, after working on this for a while, that you may wish to
develop a separate policy for the selection or development, change,
testing and implementation of software.  This might be stated as simply
as, "No system shall be acquired, developed, changed or implemented
without the prior approval of the Systems Steering Group."  This might
also go on to cover documentation; e.g., "Documentation must be complete
for all systems prior to implementation, and must include sections on
files used, access controls, security considerations and controls
(etc.)."

Some further points for consideration are included in the next section.

11.  COMPUTER SECURITY POLICY:  POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION

Any policy on computer security must be based on the premise that
information is a valuable asset of the company, just like its premises,
equipment, raw materials, inventory and so on.  More than one company has
gone under because they lost their accounts receivable data in a fire,
flood, or from a simple hard disk failure.  The value of your data should
be subjected to a risk analysis, and all identifiable risks assessed.  It
is not until you identify the risks that you can plan for a disaster
recovery.

Your policy might include some of the many things addressed previously in
this paper:  e.g., storing data only on removable media (diskettes or
tapes), limiting access to bulletin boards, establishing password
controls, rules on physical security, use of immunization software, etc. 
There are, however, some other specific points not previously discussed:

RESPONSIBILITY
Recognize that security is a management issue, not a technological
issue, and that setting policy is the responsibility of senior
management.  They must be 'on board' and understand why a security policy
is needed to make it sensible and effective, and they must give overt
support.

Someone should be in charge of computer and network security.  Without
someone in charge, important security tasks may not get done.  The duties
of the security manager would include responsibility for limiting access
to the network, securing the information that passes over it, overseeing
password systems, and installing security packages that protect computers
from illegal tampering once a user is on the network.  Other duties might
include analyzing the network for security weaknesses and helping users
understand the security strengths and weaknesses of the network.

The amount of time required of the system security specialist may depend
on the size of the organization, and on the number and complexity of the
systems in use or planned.

Having one person in charge is probably the ideal security arrangement.
The security specialist can become aware of all of the issues affecting
computer/network security, can schedule and establish priority for
actions, and can ensure that the actions are taken.

This position in the organization requires some authority and autonomy. 
For instance, security is compromised if the boss shares his/her
password.  The  security specialist needs to be able to change the boss's
password if this happens, and gently but firmly discuss the problems
which could result. 


In many organizations, putting two or more people in charge of something
diffuses responsibility.  Each can think that some security concern was
the responsibility of the other.  If two individuals are charged with
network security, be certain that they work well together, communicate











                                 - 27 -

well, and will each put in their fair share of the analysis and work that
is required for security.

In some organizations, a "communications manager" is responsible for
limiting access to the network (with dialback modems and encryption
devices), while the network manager maintains password systems and
installs security software. 

If someone is in charge of network security and you don't know about it,
then they haven't been very  obvious about it.  They need not be.  But if
it is evident to you that security is lacking, then perhaps the issue of
responsibility should be examined (or re-examined).


BACKUPS
Those who are most zealous about backups are those who've been affected
in the past by a loss of data.  If backups are performed every day, your
computer or network is probably in good shape when the hard disk or file
server goes to heaven.  You will want to verify that this is the case,
since most organizations (and individuals) put this off... and off...
until it's too late.

Backing a system up once a week is not enough, unless the system is
rarely used.  If your last backup was a week ago, and your hard disk or
the hard disk in the file server crashes, all users of the network have
lost one week's work.

This cost is enormous.  If you have 10 users who have lost 30 hours of
work each, if each user is paid $20/hour, and overhead is 100%, then you
have just lost 10 x 30 x 20 x 2 = $12,000.  If you assume that backup
takes one $20 hour with a tape drive, you could back the system up 600
times for $12,000. That's nearly three years, if backups are done five
times a week.  Many hard disks will not run continuously for three years. 
Even if you're a 'stand alone' computer user, your time is valuable.  You
might consider a policy that, if recovery covers a period of more than
'x' days, it must be done on the employee's own time, and all deadlines
must be met - tough, but it get's the point across!

Irregular backups are a sign that backup is not taken as seriously as it
should be.  It is probably wisest to do the arithmetic, comparing the
costs of backup with the costs of losing work for multiple users.  The
cost comparison in the commentary on the second answer doesn't even
consider the possibility of losing irreplaceable files, such as those
containing new accounts receivable entries or new prospects.

Since file backup is a "private" activity, not knowing how often it
occurs  does not mean that it does not occur.  But if you have a security
concern,  you should find out what the correct answer is.  After all, if
you use the network, and it is not backed up frequently, it is your work
that is lost when the hard disk in the server crashes.














                                 - 28 -

BEWARE:  backing up is NOT enough!  You MUST periodically run your
recovery procedure .... how else will you know it will work when you need
it most?


PURCHASING
The policy should state the controls in place for purchase of both
hardware and software, and it should be consistent and centralized. 
Unless you've seen what some software can do to destroy security, or how
difficult it is to interconnect different equipment, this might seem to
destroy some autonomous activities in your organization.  Autonomy be
darned, it's the company that's paying the bill.


MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS
All warranty registrations must be mailed to the manufacturer, and
records kept of purchase dates, expiry dates and repairs made under the
warranty.  Keeping accurate records has substantiated the complete
replacement of more than one machine.


SOFTWARE LOADING
The checking, copying and loading of software should be the
responsibility of one person or department.  The 'penalty' for loading
illegal/unauthorized software can range from a note in the personnel file
to dismissal, depending on the organization.  The opposite, copying the
organization's software for loading in another location, should also be
covered in the policy, because the company (as the registered owner)
could be party to a lawsuit without the ability to plead ignorance.





EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION
In several organizations, when a person submits their resignation, their
access to the computer system is immediately withdrawn.  This, of course,
requires a close liaison with the personnel department in large
organizations.  Many of these companies feel it's worth the salary cost
to have the person leave the premises immediately (escorted), and simply
pay out their notice period.  If your company adopts such a policy, it
should be made very clear that it is not an indication of trust in the
person, but simply a means to reduce risk to the valuable resources of
hardware, software and data.  It must be administered consistently and
equitably to avoid problems.    There are problems with such a policy,
not the least of which could be someone who gives a very lengthy notice
period simply because they're aware of the policy - but you could
transfer them to a clerical job for the interim (like the mail room) or
to maintenance staff (washroom detail).

12.  TO RUN SCAN (Virus detection software included on this diskette)

SCAN looks for 42 viruses in software files, but not in data files.  I
know it works on Jerusalem-B because I used SCAN to detect that virus on
a machine at work.  This is NOT the latest version of SCAN, but then
again, you're not likely to have the latest viruses (I hope).

If you want to print the documentation, type:  COPY A:SCAN.DOC PRN
If you want to run SCAN, just type:     A:SCAN [drive identifier]
                                 e.g.,  A:SCAN C:

reading or using the information on this diskette, then I am rewarded. 
If you found it useful, please feel free to copy this diskette or its
contents and share it with others - I would ask that you don't change
anything, though.  (It was virus free at the time I made the original
diskette - but if you trust that statement, you might just have made your
first mistake.)  

If you'd like to make suggestions that would improve the information on
this diskette, I would be very happy to hear from you.  I'd also like to
hear from you if you wish to discuss security issues, get a virus
infection or hit by a Trojan Horse, or even just to comment on the
contents of this paper.  My address and phone number are on the first
page of this document.

If you would like to join the National Computer Security Association, a
'form' for application is on the next page.  They provide benefits such
as a Virus Self-Defense Kit that's more sophisticated than the software
on this diskette, newsletters, a virus-free bulletin board with hundreds
of security-related programs, discounts on software, books and
conferences, and advice if you run into trouble.

Happy (and safe) computing!
