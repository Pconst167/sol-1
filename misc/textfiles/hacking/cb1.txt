       Hello Hackers, this month I am going to show you excerpts from my
hacking log.  This excerpt is about my excursion with Citibank and how I got
into it.  Alright lets get going:

December 20, 1984

I booted up my computer and called Airwolf.  There I got Washington's
Citibank Number. Curious, I wrote it down. After uploading and downloading a
few files, I logged off.  I turned then set my equipment into "hack" mode
and called Citibank.  The first time I called a lady answered. I hung up.

December 21, 1984

I tried it again.  This time I got a carrier and got on. A bunch of crap
flew accross the screen.  Then I got to the cursor asking me to type in
something. I typed in 1 (a good thing to type when first logging on into a
bank, I dont know why though). It returned with "@bad logon"

I found out I had to type a Logon (I knew that 1 was good for something) I
typed in some crap:"some crap" and watched what happened. It returned with
that error message again. I did it a third time, and this time got logged
off.  I wonder if I got traced during that call? I said to myself. I checked
and found out I didn't.  Most banks will do it sooner or later so I stopped
hacking for now.

December 29 1984

Christmas was great.  I also got a password scanner from Santa Claus.  I
dialed Citibank and got that lady again. I called half an hour later, and
got the carrier. I set up my scanner, and let it rip.  about 7.32 minutes
later It got something.  I am not going to tell you what format the logon is
in but it is sort of like this X XXXX.XX. Scan your own crap.  It then asked
for a verification Number or something. I typed in 1.  after that, it said
"fuck you, I know you are a freak. get off this computer ", just kiddin'. It
said something like "error , please try again, thank you ", well at least it
said something in between. anyways, I then typed A1 (no relation to the
steak sauce). nothing happened for a while, am I in????? nope. It logged
off. I didn't get traced that time either. This looks like a safe bank (or a
hacker trap). I called again. I am not going to tell you how I got in,
because if you can, then you are worthy of getting in, if you can't then you
shouldn't be doing it. It is for your own safety (also, the wolfman wouldn't
let me put up the logons ( i guess even he has some tact)). I will though
tell you what to do once you get in.  It goes something like this

TRANSCRIPT @1

i have just logged on. this is the cursor you see :"@"
@b
logging off

(if you type b you will get logged off)

l
error
if you type l or something else that is stupid you will get an
error message. not just "error" I was using it for an example. It
will actually say someting like "error in format" etc....

@l:10245

1:     $100/00
2:     000/97.21
3:        /23.12
4:   $1000/23.11

That is something like what you get. It is some listing. Now that I am into
10245's account, I want to see his name, right, so I type the following
@n

if you type n you will get "new account:" since you don't want that you
type x . dont ask my why x, but it will give you that. here is what you
see.
