Further access points will be brought into service before the end

PSS Dialplus provides extensive 'local call' coverage through
a network of over 60 access points, enabling Campus Gold to
provide you with a further choice of access methods. It is
also extremely easy to use.

CONNECTING TO CAMPUS GOLD VIA PSS DIALPLUS

1. Set up your communication software or modem to dial
   a PSS DIALPLUS number.

2. When the call is connected, a welcome screen will
   appear and you will be prompted for a password.

       PASSWORD is  GOLD01

As you type in the password, the characters will be masked by
asterisks.
If the password is incorrectly entered you will be prompted to
enter it again. However, if the password is incorrectly typed
on three consecutive occasion the call will be discontinued.

3. PSS Dialplus will connect you immediately to Campus Gold
   system and you will be prompted for your ID and password
   in the normal way.

The screen will show PSS DIALPLUS dialing and connecting to
the CAMPUS GOLD SYSTEM :

             Calling      23421920100401
             Connected to 23421920100401

             Welcome to Campus System 01
             Please sign on >
4. type in your usual Campus Gold ID and PASSWORD.

5. When you log off from Campus Gold, you will be automatically
   disconnected from the PSS Dialplus service.

If you have any difficulty accessing Campus Gold via PSS Dialplus
please contact our helpline on 01-782-7615 or TCD029.

Seems like BT are better at keeping secrets than I thought - something like
this ought to be public knowledge - PSS at 2400 baud and MNP!

The problem with Dialplus seems to be that it asks for passwords instead
of NUI's. If anyone manages to make the system accept NUI's in the normal PSS
manner than please let me know.

Since TTNS (Campus 2000) is on Telecom Gold system 01, it's logical to assume
that the other Gold systems (72-87) can be called this way (though I've been
unable to try this)

Which brings another point. The Nottingham node is often engaged - presumably
the system is on a single phone line. So if you get the busy tone, keep
trying!

If you have questions/comments/suggestions/discoveries/passwords or anything
else of interest about PSS Dialplus, please leave a message for 'Boris' on
GoobTel (0602-706307; V21/23) - thanks!

Bye for now, and keep on hacking!

Boz...
