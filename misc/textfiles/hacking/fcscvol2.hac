NOTES TO REVIEWERS



This is the first public draft of work in progress by the joint 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and 
National Security Agency (NSA) Federal Criteria (FC) Project. 
This draft Federal Criteria for Information Technology Security 
is provided for preliminary review and comment by members of the 
national and international computer security community.  The 
document will evolve into a new Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) intended principally for use by the United States 
Federal Government, and also by others as desired and 
appropriate.  The FIPS is intended to replace the Trusted Computer 
System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) or "Orange Book."

Our objectives in presenting this draft material are threefold: 
first, to give the community a clear view of the FC Project's 
direction in moving beyond the TCSEC method of expressing 
requirements in order to meet new IT security challenges; second, 
to obtain feedback on the innovative approaches taken, the method 
of presentation, and granularity; and third, to make a 
substantial contribution to the dialogue among nations leading to 
the harmonization of IT security requirements and evaluations.

It is important to note a few things about this preliminary FC 
draft. First, it is a new and unpolished document and not intended 
for any purpose except review and comment. Organizations should 
not adopt any contents of this draft document for their use.  It 
is anticipated that the document will undergo extensive revision 
as it works its way through the public FIPS approval process over 
the next year or two.  Second, the FC is being distributed in two 
volumes. Volume I addresses the criteria development process and 
is intended principally for use by developers of protection 
profiles. The information in Volume I may also be of use to IT 
product manufacturers and product evaluators. Volume II presents 
completed IT product security criteria in the form of accepted 
protection profiles.

The protection profiles associated with the final FIPS will help 
consumers identify types of products that meet the protection 
requirements within their particular organizations and 
environments.  However, the FIPS will be supplemented by a series 
of implementing guidance documents, many of which will be 
designed to help consumers make cost-effective decisions about 
obtaining and appropriately using security-capable IT products.

As a preliminary draft of the new FC-FIPS, this document is not 
intended for general distribution or compliance.  The document 
should not be considered a complete or finished product.  Your 
comments will be used by the Federal Criteria Working Group to 
help raise the maturity level of this material prior to being 
circulated for further public comment in the FIPS development 
process.

ADDITIONAL NOTES TO REVIEWERS



Reviewers who provide substantive comments on the enclosed draft 
FC by March 31, 1993 will be invited to attend an Invitational 
Workshop on the Federal Criteria. This two-day workshop will be 
held in the last week of April 1993 in the Washington-Baltimore 
area at a location to be announced. All comments received by the 
cut-off date will be correlated into major themes for discussion 
by break-out groups at the workshop. The results will be used as 
input into the process of re-drafting the FC for a second round of 
comment prior to its being formalized as a FIPS.

Chapter  1.
Commercial Security Requirements (CSR)

1.1	Introduction

Government and commercial institutions rely heavily on 
information technology (IT) products to meet their 
operational, financial, and information requirements. The 
corruption, unauthorized disclosure, or theft of 
electronically-maintained resources can have a disruptive 
effect on an organization's operations as well as serious and 
immediate financial, legal, and public confidence impact.

Products conforming to the Commercial Security (CS) 
requirements contained in this document are intended to be 
useful to a broad base of users in the private, civil 
government, and defense sectors. This includes application 
developers, end users, and system administrators. The 
Protection Profiles specified in this document provide 
organizations with three set of security requirements, 
defined as CS1, CS2, and CS3, with CS3 offering the highest 
degree of trust.

The Protection Profiles as a whole specify "baseline" 
requirements that meet generally accepted security 
expectations for a class of products colloquially called 
"general purpose, multi-user operating systems." These 
requirements apply to multi-user workstations, minicomputers, 
and mainframes. Most required mechanisms are configurable so 
that customers can satisfy their unique security policies and 
objectives.

The intent of the Protection Profiles is to promote the wide 
availability of products possessing security enforcing 
functions that are of such broad applicability and 
effectiveness that they become part of the "normal" mode of 
operation. It is anticipated that vendors will respond to user 
expectations by increasing the availability of operating 
systems that meet these general security requirements. These 
requirements represent the integration of a number of security 
requirement specifications from various sources into a single 
set that is expected to have wide acceptance.

1.1.1	CS Description

The Protection Profiles address the security features and 
their development. The Protection Profiles were written to 
meet several objectives: to serve as a "metric" for the amount 
of security present in a computer system processing sensitive 
information; to provide guidance to the developers as to what 
security features to build into their planned products; and 
to provide a method for uniformly specifying security 
requirements in acquisition specifications. 

The CS requirements are divided into three hierarchical 
Protection Profiles. The profiles are CS1, CS2, and CS3, with 
C3 providing the greatest degree of security. Each profile 
represents a level of trust that can be placed in a product 
and specifies a collection of requirements in the form of 
features and assurances. Each profile includes most of the 
features and assurances of the previous profile along with 
additional, more stringent features and assurances. The 
reasoning for requirements leveling for each Protection 
Profile can be found in the rationale in Chapter 2. This 
reasoning is based on the overall effectiveness of each 
Protection Profile in addressing the threats identified in 
that chapter. 

The Protection Profiles specify computer-based protection 
mechanisms for the design, use, and management of information 
systems. The Protection Profiles include technical measures 
that can be incorporated into multi-user, remote-access, 
resource-sharing, and information sharing computer systems. 
CS-conformant computer products provide system administrators 
with tools to control the sharing of information and resources 
based primarily on the identity of users, or, in the case of 
CS3, the role associated with the user, as well as the time 
of day, terminal location, or type of access requested. The 
technical measures also provide tools to protect against both 
common user actions that may compromise security and against 
deliberate penetration attempts by "hackers." In addition, 
there are requirements to log events that may impact the 
security of either the product or the information that it is 
processing. All functionality requirements are based on 
existing and well understood security practices.

1.1.2	Background

These Protection Profiles have been developed by the CS 
Working Group of the Federal Criteria Project under NIST 
leadership with a high level of private sector participation. 
They are based on the Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria (TCSEC) [1] C2 criteria class, with additions from 
current computer industry practice, from commercial security 
requirements specifications, and from the on-going work of the 
Federal Criteria Project. Their development has also been 
guided by international security standards efforts and by the 
recommendations of the System Security Study Committee.

The following sub-sections provide descriptions of each of 
these sources, and gives further background on the motivation 
for and development of the Protection Profiles.

1.1.2.1	Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) 

The TCSEC [1], originally published in 1983 and revised in 
1985, was the first publicly available document that expressed 
general security requirements that could apply to a specific 
class of technology (e.g., operating systems). It represents 
the culmination of many years of effort to address Information 
Technolgy (IT) security issues within the Department of 
Defense (DoD) classified world. The TCSEC is made up of IT 
security features and assurances that have been derived and 
engineered to support a very specific DoD security policy - 
the prevention of unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information (i.e., confidentiality). 

During the past few years, commercial enterprises and 
government organizations processing sensitive information 
have begun to pay increasing attention to IT security needs. 
Although the TCSEC-motivated security features have proven 
valuable in addressing their security problems, often these 
features have been viewed as less than perfect and incomplete 
and only to have been specified because a more appropriate set 
of security functions has not been available.

The Protection Profiles are intended to be the first step 
in "filling this gap" by providing a set of security 
requirements appropriate for commercial enterprises and 
government organizations concerned with protecting sensitive 
information.

1.1.2.2	Commercial Security Efforts

Recognizing that the TCSEC was a valuable starting point, 
but not sufficient for their security needs, two commercial 
companies - Bellcore and American Express Travel Related 
Services (TRS) - independently initiated efforts to develop 
security requirements for their environments. At Bellcore, 
these efforts resulted in a Bellcore Standard Operating 
Environment Security Requirements [3] document and at TRS the 
efforts resulted in the internal C2-Plus company security 
standard.

The Bellcore document was developed to meet the security 
needs of Bellcore and its client companies, the Regional Bell 
Operating Companies (RBOCs). The requirements specified in 
the Bellcore document were derived both from commonly 
recurring security requirements for RBOC computer 
applications and from experiences of Bellcore's computer 
security assessment group.

 In developing the C2-Plus document, TRS found that, while 
the TCSEC met many requirements of the commercial sector, the 
prescribed features at the C2-level (and its F2-level 
counterpart in the ITSEC [2]) fell short in several areas that 
were either introduced at higher TCSEC levels or were not 
addressed at all in the respective standards. Consequently, 
the TRS document was developed as an enhanced, commercialized 
version of the C2-level security requirements of the TCSEC. 

Using the TRS document as input, the International 
Information Integrity Institute (I-4), a consortium of large 
international corporations, developed the Commercial 
International Security Requirements (CISR) [4]. The rationale 
for the development of the CISR include the following:

"Military-oriented information security 
requirements (i. e., TCSEC) are not suitable in 
many respects for the needs of international 
businesses." [4]

The final version of the CISR was published in April 1992.

1.1.2.3	System Security Study Committee

The System Security Study Committee was formed in 1988 in 
response to a request from the Defense Advance Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) to address the security and 
trustworthiness of U.S. computing and communications systems. 
The Committee, which was composed of 16 individuals from 
industry and academia, including computer and communications 
security researchers, practitioners, and software engineers, 
was charged with developing a national research, engineering, 
and policy agenda to help the United States achieve a more 
trustworthy computing technology base by the end of the 
century. In 1991, the Committee published the Computers at 
Risk [5] report, which presents the Committee's assessment of 
key computer and communications security issues and its 
recommendations for enhancing the security and 
trustworthiness of the U.S. computing and communications 
infrastructure. 

The development of the Protection Profiles was guided by 
one of the recommendations from this report that:

"...a basic set of security-related principles for 
the design, use, and management of systems that are 
of such broad applicability and effectiveness that 
they ought to be a part of any system with 
significant operational requirements" [5] should be 
developed.

1.1.2.4	Minimum Security Functionality Requirements (MSFR)

The second draft of the Minimum Security Functionality 
Requirements for Multi-User Operating Systems (MSFR) [10] was 
published in January of 1992. The MSFR was developed as part 
of a project to stimulate the development of IT products 
broadly useful to the diverse security needs of the US 
Government (civilian and military) and the private sector. 

The MSFR specified the minimum level of security that NIST 
and NSA felt should be available in any commercially available 
multi-user operating system. The MSFR represents an extension 
of the TCSEC controlled access protection class, level C2, 
with additions based on current industry practice and security 
requirements specifications developed in the commercial 
environment. Much of the MSFR is derived from the TCSEC, the 
Bellcore Standard Operating Environment Security 
Requirements, and the CISR with overall guidance from the 
Computers at Risk report [5]. 

1.1.2.5	Commercial Security (CS) requirements

To help support the Federal Criteria, the CS Working Group 
was tasked with developing a family of Protection Profiles, 
based on an updated version of the MSFR. The three Protection 
Profiles included in this document have been developed in 
compliance with the prescribed approach and format of the 
Federal Criteria [11]. Components of the Federal Criteria were 
selected for each Protection Profile and were enhanced with 
refinements and assignments that were taken from the November 
1992 version of the MSFR. The Protection Profiles are intended 
to satisfy the most common security needs of computer system 
users. 

1.1.3	Document Organization

Chapter 1 (this chapter) provides introductory and 
background information. The rest of this document is divided 
into three Protection Profiles, CS1, CS2, and CS3. The 
development of these Protection Profiles are in accordance 
with the Protection Profile format specified by the Federal 
Criteria. Chapter 2 provides the rationale for the selection 
of the security features and assurance evidence. This 
rationale also includes descriptions of the intended use of 
the product, the environmental assumptions that were made for 
a CS-compliant system, and the expected threats. Chapter 3 
specifies the security functionality that a CS-compliant 
system is required to provide, and Chapter 4 specifies the 
assurance requirements. At the end of the CS requirements, 
there is a Glossary and a list of references. 

COMMERCIAL SECURITY 1 (CS1)

 Products that comply with this Protection Profile 
provide access control capabilities to separate 
users and data based on finely grained access con-
trols. It incorporates credible controls capable of 
enforcing access limitations on an individual 
basis, i.e., ostensibly suitable for allowing users 
to be able to protect sensitive information and to 
keep other users from reading or destroying their 
data. Users are individually accountable for their 
actions through login procedures, auditing of secu-
rity relevant events, and resource isolation. This 
CS1 Protection Profile is equivalent to a Class C2 
- Controlled Access Protection from the TCSEC [1]. 
It consists of TCSEC requirements plus those eval-
uation interpretations that a product must meet 
before it can be evaluated at the C2 level.

CS1 Rationale

2.2	Introduction

As outlined in the Federal Criteria, this rationale de-
scribes the protection philosophy, how the security features 
are intended to be used, the assumptions about the environment 
in which a compliant product is intended to operate, the 
threats within that environment, and the security features and 
assurances that counter these threats.

The level of components that were chosen for the CS1 Pro-
tection Profile are equivalent to Class C2 of the TCSEC [1]. 
They consist of TCSEC requirements plus those evaluation in-
terpretations that a product must meet before it can be eval-
uated at the C2 level.

2.2.1	Protection Philosophy

Any discussion of protection necessarily starts from a pro-
tection philosophy, i.e., what it really means to call the 
product "secure." In general, products will control access to 
information and other resources through the use of specific 
security features so that only properly authorized individu-
als or processes acting on their behalf will be granted ac-
cess. For CS1, three fundamental requirements are derived for 
this statement of protection:

o	Access authorization

o	Accountability

o	Assurance 

The totality of the functionality that enforces the access 
authorization and accountability protection philosophy is 
comprised of the hardware, software, and firmware of the 
Trusted Computing Base (TCB). CS1 requires the TCB to be pro-
tected from external interference and tampering so that it is 
effective at countering identified threats. The assurance 
protection philosophy is comprised of the development pro-
cess, operational support, development evidence, and evalua-
tion process assurances. Each of these are explained below.

2.2.1.1	Access Authorization

The access authorization portion of the philosophy of pro-
tection for this profile addresses subject and object access 
mediation. CS1 provides protected access to resources and ob-
jects. As defined in the TCSEC and specified in this profile, 
access control permits system users and the processes that 
represent them to allow or disallow to other users access to 
objects under their control:

Access control is "a means of restricting access to 
objects based on the identity of subjects and/or 
groups to which they belong. The controls are dis-
cretionary in the sense that a subject with a cer-
tain access permission is capable of passing that 
permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any other 
subject." [1]

These controls permit the granting and revoking of access 
privileges to be left to the discretion of the individual us-
ers. 

2.2.1.2	Accountability

The accountability portion of the philosophy of protection 
for this profile addresses user Identification and Authenti-
cation (I&A) and requirements for security auditing. Each of 
these are explained below.

2.2.1.2.1	Identification and Authentication

User identification is required to support access control 
and security auditing. This includes the capability to estab-
lish, maintain, and protect a unique identifier for each au-
thorized user. User identification is functionally dependent 
on authentication. Authentication is a method of validating a 
person as a legitimate user.

2.2.1.2.2	Audit

For most secure products, a capability must exist to audit 
the security relevant events. As each user performs security 
relevant tasks, the product must record the user identifier, 
the action performed, and the result in a security log. For 
CS1 compliant products, a capability is specified to allow a 
system administrator to access and evaluate audit informa-
tion. This capability provides a method of protection in the 
sense that security relevant events that occur within a com-
puter system can be logged and the responsible user held ac-
countable for his/her actions. Audit trails are used to detect 
and deter penetration of a computer system and to reveal ac-
tivity that identifies misuse.

CS1 provides for an effective audit mechanism by supporting 
the following basic security characteristics. It provides the 
ability to:

o	 review the use of I&A mechanisms;

o	 discover the introduction of objects into a user's 
address space;

o	 discover the deletion of objects; and

o	 discover actions taken by computer operators and sys-
tem administrators.

2.2.1.3	Assurance

Assurance addresses threats and vulnerabilities that can 
affect the product during its development and it addresses 
evaluation assurance. Assurance Package T1 was selected for 
the CS1 level. This minimal assurance level is intended to 
include most commercial computer products that incorporate 
protection components today. Minimal assurance refers to the 
fact that this package includes the lowest levels of develop-
ment and evaluation assurance components and only those com-
ponents deemed important to provide the necessary minimal 
understanding of the product. 

The intent of the product development assurance for this 
package is to establish that the external behavior of the 
product conforms to its user level and administrative docu-
mentation without any analysis of the internal structure of 
the product's TCB. For this reason, only the claimed TCB pro-
tection properties, TCB interface description, and TCB ele-
ment list are required to enable security functional testing. 

The intent of the operational support assurance for this 
package is to establish a minimal level of user and adminis-
trative guidance and product information that enables the cor-
rect product installation, use of product security features, 
and remediation of flaws. 

The development evidence is commensurate with the assuranc-
es required. The intent is to require the type of assurance 
evidence that is generated during the normal commercial de-
velopment process. 

 Evaluation support assurance establishes that the product, 
and the context in which it is developed and supported, is 
commensurate with the development assurance requirements. At 
the T1 level, testing analysis and the requirement for inde-
pendent testing determines whether the product minimally 
meets the functional protection requirements. Operational 
support evaluation assurance determines whether the product 
documentation correctly describes the security relevant oper-
ations.

2.2.2	Intended Method of Use

All individual users (both administrative and non-adminis-
trative) are assigned a unique user identifier. This user 
identifier supports individual accountability and access con-
trol. The operating system authenticates the claimed identity 
of the user before allowing the user to perform any further 
actions.

A CS1 compliant product imposes controls on authorized us-
ers and on processes acting on their behalf to prevent users 
from gaining access to information and other resources for 
which they are not authorized. The product provides the capa-
bility for users to allow or disallow to other users access 
to objects under their control. The objects are files that may 
be read or written to or programs which may be executed. The 
granularity of control is to the level of individual users 
(although groups made up of individual users may be specified) 
and individual objects. CS1 access controls permit the grant-
ing and revoking of access to be left to the discretion of the 
individual users.

Products that comply with CS1 specifications are intended 
to be used within the following operational constraints:

o	The information system is designed to be administered 
as a unique entity by a single organization.

o	The information system is designed to manage comput-
ing, storage, input/output, and to control the sharing 
of resources among multiple users and computer pro-
cesses.

o	The administrative and non-administrative users are 
identified as distinct individuals.

o	The granting and revoking of access control permis-
sions are left to the discretion of individual users.

o	The information system provides facilities for real-
time interaction with users that have access to input/
output devices.

2.2.3	Environmental Assumptions

A product designed to meet the CS1 Protection Profile is 
intended to be a general purpose, multi-user operating system 
that runs on either a workstation, minicomputer, or mainframe. 
CS1 compliant products are expected to be used in commercial 
and government environments. For government environments, CS1 
conforms to the TCSEC C2 class of trust [1].The information 
being processed may be unclassified, sensitive-but-unclassi-
fied, or single-level classified, but not multi-level classi-
fied information.

The following specific environmental conditions have been 
assumed in specifying CS1:

o	The product hardware base (e.g., CPU, printers, ter-
minals, etc.), firmware, and software will be pro-
tected from unauthorized physical access.

o	There will be one or more personnel assigned to manage 
the product including the security of the information 
it contains.

o	The operational environment will be managed according 
to the operational environment documentation that is 
required in the assurance chapter of the Protection 
Profile. 

o	The IT product provides a cooperative environment for 
users to accomplish some task or group of tasks.

o	The processing resources of the IT product, including 
all terminals, are assumed to be located within user 
spaces that have physical access controls established.

2.2.4	Expected Threats

In general, the choice of which Protection Profile to 
choose depends upon the level of security that is required for 
that particular organizational environment. The lowest level, 
the CS1 level, is intended for those commercial and government 
environments where all the system personnel are trusted and 
all the data on the system is at the same classification lev-
el. For example, a government agency where all personnel has 
a government clearance, all data is unclassified, and there 
is no outside network connections would be an ideal candidate 
for CS1, i.e., the threats to be countered are such that only 
a minimal level of trust is needed. However, most commercial 
and government environments are more complex and require a 
higher degree of trust. CS2 addresses the security needs for 
the mainstream commercial and government environments. It 
provides a higher level of trust for those organizations that 
need to enforce a security policy where there is no need for 
different classifications of data. CS3 is intended to provide 
the highest level of trust for commercial and government en-
vironments. It is intended to be used in those environments 
where a great deal of trust is required, such as in law en-
forcement agencies, nuclear facilities, or commercial air-
ports. It provides the strongest features, mechanisms, and 
assurances to counter these threats.

A product that is designed to meet the CS1 Protection Pro-
file and operate within its assumed environment will provide 
capabilities to counter threats. It should be noted, however, 
that although a product may faithfully implement all the fea-
tures and assurances specified in this Protection Profile, the 
complete elimination of any one threat should not be assumed.

The following threats have been assumed in specifying this 
CS1 Protection Profile:

1.	AN UNAUTHORIZED USER MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE 
SYSTEM

For CS1 compliant products, the threat of an unauthorized 
user gaining access to the system is primarily addressed by 
I&A. I&A features allow the TCB to verify the identity of in-
dividuals attempting to gain access to the system. This is 
accomplished through the use of passwords.

Although not a direct countermeasure, auditing requirements 
are specified at the CS1 level to provide the capability to 
perform an after-the-fact analysis of unauthorized system en-
try and login attempts. This provides an opportunity for the 
system administrators to take corrective actions, such as 
strengthening existing user authentication methods or requir-
ing users to change their passwords.

2.	AN AUTHORIZED USER MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO 
RESOURCES WHEN THE USER IS NOT ALLOWED ACCESS

An authorized user can try to gain access to unauthorized 
resources by assuming the user identifier of another user and 
thus gaining their associated access rights. This is addressed 
through the use of passwords.

Once an authorized user has gained access to the system, 
the threat still remains for a user to gain access to resourc-
es when the user is not authorized. At the resource level, CS1 
specifies access control features to mediate (i.e., distrib-
ute, review, and revoke) user access to a subset of resources. 

The object reuse feature has been specified to ensure that 
resource contents are cleared before they are reused. This re-
duces the vulnerability that the resource contents can be read 
before it is overwritten. 

3.	SECURITY RELEVANT ACTIONS MAY NOT BE TRACEABLE TO THE 
USER ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVENT



CS1 accountability and audit requirements are specified to 
provide the capability to track security relevant actions per-
formed by users and link such actions, if possible, to the 
responsible identifier. Audit mechanisms are responsible for 
the monitoring and detecting of real or potential security vi-
olations or events. These audit events can include successful 
or unsuccessful: I&A events, the introduction of objects into 
a user's address space, the deletion of objects, and actions 
taken by system administrators. Each audit record includes the 
date, time, location, type of event, identity of the user and 
object involved, and the success or failure of the event. 

4.	SECURITY BREACHES MAY OCCUR BECAUSE OF TCB PENETRATION

TCB protection is a fundamental capability of CS compliant 
products. The security components and mechanisms described in 
this Protection Profile depend upon the integrity of the TCB 
and on the TCB being isolated and non-circumventable. CS1 
specifies requirements for a common and basic set of security 
features to protect the TCB from outside penetration.

This threat is also countered through product assurance. 
TCB interface definition establishes the boundary between the 
TCB and its internal users. Security functional testing es-
tablishes that these TCB definitions and properties satisfy 
the requirements of this Protection Profile. 

5.	USERS MAY BE ABLE TO BYPASS THE SECURITY FEATURES OF 
THE SYSTEM

This threat is countered by authentication, access control, 
audit, TCB isolation, TCB non-circumventability, and refer-
ence mediation requirements. Authentication requirements pro-
tect authentication data from unauthorized users. Resource 
access control requirements protect access control data.

Audit requirements provide for the logging of successful 
and unsuccessful accesses to resources as well as for changes 
made to the system security configuration and system software 
in the event that the system security features have been by-
passed.

The CS1 specification for reference mediation protects the 
integrity of the access control mechanism and the TCB's func-
tionality. Starting at CS1, requirements exist for TCB medi-
ation of user references to objects and to security relevant 
services. 

CS1-compliant products maintain a domain for its own exe-
cution to protect it from external interference and tampering. 
Such requirements address TCB isolation and non-circumvent-
ability of TCB isolation functions. 

This threat is also countered through product assurance. 
The definition of TCB properties assures the consistency of 
the TCB's behavior. The identification of TCB elements pro-
vides the set of elements that determine the protection char-
acteristics of a product. The TCB interface definition 
establishes the boundary between the TCB and its internal us-
ers. Security functional testing establishes that these TCB 
definitions and properties satisfy the requirements of this 
Protection Profile, and provide evidence against users being 
able to bypass the security features of the system.
CS1 Functionality

3.	Introduction

This section provides detailed functionality requirements 
that must be satisfied by an Commercial Security 1 (CS1) 
compliant product. Note that all plain text are words taken 
directly from the Federal Criteria [11]. Any assignments or 
refinements made to the text in the Federal Criteria for this 
Protection Profile are indicated by the use of bold italics. 
A Protection Profile requirement is an assignment when it is 
directly taken as stated from the Federal Criteria component 
without change or when a binding is made to a Federal Criteria 
threshold definition. A Protection Profile requirement is a 
refinement when a Federal Criteria requirement is taken to a 
lower level of abstraction. The characterization of 
Protection Profile requirements as being either assignments 
or refinements can be found at each component level.

This Protection Profile for CS1 utilizes the following 
levels from the Federal Criteria. Note that not all the 
components from the Federal Criteria are reflected in this 
Protection Profile; there are no specific requirements for 
those components that are not listed.

3.1	Identification & Authentication 

All users of the product must be identified and 
authenticated. A login process is established that the user 
interacts with in order to provide the information necessary 
for identification and authentication. The identification and 
authentication process begins the user's interaction with the 
target product. First, the user supplies a unique user 
identifier to the TCB. Then, the user is asked by the TCB to 
authenticate that claimed identity. The user identifier is 
used for both access control and also for accountability. 
Therefore, the proper maintenance and control of the 
identification mechanism and the identification databases are 
vital to product security. Once a user has supplied an 
identifier to the TCB, the TCB must verify that the user 
really corresponds to the claimed identifier. This is done by 
the authentication mechanism as described by the following 
requirements. 

For the CS1 level, I&A-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. This I&A component level has not been refined from 
the Federal Criteria.

I&A-1 Minimal Identification and Authentication

1.	The TCB shall require users to identify 
themselves to it before beginning to perform any 
other actions that the TCB is expected to mediate. 
The TCB shall be able to enforce individual 
accountability by providing the capability to 
uniquely identify each individual user. The TCB 
shall also provide the capability of associating 
this identity with all auditable actions taken by 
that individual.

2. 	The TCB shall use a protected mechanism (e.g., 
passwords) to authenticate the user's identity.

3. 	The TCB shall protect authentication data so 
that it cannot be used by any unauthorized user.

3.2	Audit 

Audit supports accountability by providing a trail of user 
actions. Actions are associated with individual users for 
security relevant events and are stored in an audit trail. 
This audit trail can be examined to determine what happened 
and what user was responsible for a security relevant event. 
The audit trail data must be protected from unauthorized 
access, modification, or destruction. In addition, the audit 
trail data must be available in a useful and timely manner for 
analysis. 

Audit data is recorded from several sources (such as from 
the TCB or a privileged application) to produce a complete 
picture of a user's security relevant actions. Therefore, 
audit data must be correlated across audit collection systems. 
The mechanisms providing audit data recording must be 
tailorable to each product's needs. Both the audit data itself 
and the mechanisms to determine what audit data is recorded 
are protected by privileges.

Once the audit data is recorded, it is analyzed and 
reported. At the CS1 level, reports are generated on request.

For the CS1 level, AD-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

AD-1 - Minimal Audit

1.	The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and 
protect from modification or unauthorized access 
or destruction an audit trail of accesses to the 
objects it protects. The audit data shall be 
protected by the TCB so that read access to it is 
limited to those who are authorized for audit 
data.

2.	The TCB shall be able to record the following 
types of events:

	- use of the identification and authentication 
mechanisms;

	- introduction of objects into a user's address 
space (e.g., file open, program initiation), and 
deletion of objects;

	- actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators and/or system security officers.

3.	For each recorded event, the audit record shall 
identify: date and time of the event, user, type 
of event, and success or failure of the event. For 
identification/authentication events the origin of 
request (e.g., terminal ID) shall be included in 
the audit record. For events that introduce an 
object into a user's address space and for object 
deletion events the audit record shall include the 
name and policy attributes of the object (e.g., 
object security level).

4.	The system administrator shall be able to 
selectively audit the actions of one or more users 
based on individual identity and/or object policy 
attributes (e.g., object security level).

3.3	Access Control 

Once the user has been granted access, the question of which 
objects that authenticated user may access still remains. The 
requirements below describe these subject accesses to 
objects. 

For the CS1 level, AC-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

AC-1 Minimal Access Control

1.	Definition of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and protect access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. Subject 
attributes shall include named individuals or 
defined groups or both. Object attributes shall 
include defined access rights (e.g., read, write, 
execute) that can be assigned to subject 
attributes.

2.	Administration of Access Control Attributes.

The TCB shall define and enforce rules for 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. The effect of 
these rules shall be that access permission to an 
object by users not already possessing access 
permission is assigned only by authorized users. 
These rules shall allow authorized users to 
specify and control sharing of objects by named 
individuals or defined groups of individuals, or 
by both, and shall provide controls to limit 
propagation of access rights. These controls shall 
be capable of including or excluding access to the 
granularity of a single user.

If different rules of assignment and modification 
of access control attributes apply to different 
subjects and/or objects, the totality of these 
rules shall be shown to support the defined 
policy.

3.	Authorization of Subject References to Objects

The TCB shall define and enforce authorization 
rules for the mediation of subject references to 
objects. These rules shall be based on the access 
control attributes of subjects and objects. These 
rules shall, either by explicit user action or by 
default, provide that objects are protected from 
unauthorized access.

The scope of the authorization rules shall include 
a defined subset of the product's subjects and 
objects and associated access control attributes. 
The coverage of authorization rules shall specify 
the types of objects and subjects to which these 
rules apply. If different rules apply to different 
subjects and objects, the totality of these rules 
shall be shown to support the defined policy.

4.	Subject and Object Creation and Destruction

The TCB shall control the creation and destruction 
of subjects and objects. These controls shall 
include object reuse. That is, all authorizations 
to the information contained within a storage 
object shall be revoked prior to initial 
assignment, allocation or reallocation to a 
subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage 
objects; information, including encrypted 
representations of information, produced by a 
prior subjects' actions shall be unavailable to 
any subject that obtains access to an object that 
has been released back to the system.

3.4	Reference Mediation 

Reference mediation, that is, the control by the TCB of 
subject accesses to objects, must be ensured so that the users 
can have faith in the TCB's access control decisions. Also, 
users must be ensured that all access to security services are 
mediated by the TCB.    

For the CS1 level, RM-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No further refinements were made from the Federal 
Criteria.

RM-1 Mediation of References to a Defined Subject/Object 
Subset

1. 	The TCB shall mediate all references to 
subjects, objects, resources, and services (e.g., 
TCB functions) described in the TCB 
specifications. The mediation shall ensure that 
all references are directed to the appropriate 
security-policy functions.

2.	Reference mediation shall include references to 
the defined subset of subjects, objects, and 
resources protected under the TCB security policy, 
and to their policy attributes (e.g., access 
rights, security and/or integrity levels, role 
identifiers).

3. 	References issued by privileged subjects shall 
be mediated in accordance with the policy 
attributes defined for those subjects.

3.5	TCB Protection 

TCB protection is a fundamental requirement for a secure 
product. All of the security components and mechanisms that 
have been described depend upon the integrity of the TCB and 
on the TCB being isolated and non-circumventable. The TCB must 
be resistant to outside penetration. 

For the CS1 level, P-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

P-1 Basic TCB Isolation

The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own 
execution that protects it from external 
interference and tampering (e.g., by reading or 
modification of its code and data structures). The 
protection of the TCB shall provide TCB isolation 
and noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions as follows:

	1. TCB Isolation requires that (1) the address 
spaces of the TCB and those of unprivileged 
subjects are separated such that users, or 
unprivileged subjects operating on their behalf, 
cannot read or modify TCB data structures or code, 
(2) the transfers between TCB and non-TCB domains 
are controlled such that arbitrary entry to or 
return from the TCB are not possible; and (3) the 
user or application parameters passed to the TCB 
by addresses are validated with respect to the TCB 
address space, and those passed by value are 
validated with respect to the values expected by 
the TCB.

	2. Noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions requires that the permission to objects 
(and/or to non-TCB data) passed as parameters to 
the TCB are validated with respect to the 
permissions required by the TCB, and references to 
TCB objects implementing TCB isolation functions 
are mediated by the TCB.

3.6	TCB Self-Checking 

Validating the correct operation of the TCB firmware and 
hardware is an important aspect of guaranteeing the integrity 
of the product. Hardware and software features that validate 
the correct operation of the product will be delivered with 
the product to ensure that the hardware and firmware are 
installed properly and are in working order.

For the CS1 level, SC-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

SC-1 Minimal Self Checking

Hardware and/or software features shall be 
provided that can be used to periodically validate 
the correct operation of the on-site hardware and 
firmware elements of the TCB.

CS1 Assurance

4.	Introduction

This chapter provides the CS1 development and evaluation 
assurance requirements package using the development and 
evaluation assurance components defined in Volume I and the 
package contained in Volume I, Appendix G of the Federal 
Criteria. The structure of each assurance package follows that 
of the assurance components (i.e., each package consists of 
development process, operational support, development 
environment, development evidence, and evaluation process 
components). 

Assurance Package T1 

This minimal assurance level is intended to include most 
commercial computer products that incorporate protection 
components. Minimal assurance refers to the fact that this 
package includes the lowest levels of development and 
evaluation assurance components and only those components 
deemed important to provide the necessary minimal 
understanding of the product. 

The intent of product development assurance for this 
package is to establish that the external behavior of the 
product conforms to its user level and administrative 
documentation without any analysis of the internal structure 
of the product's TCB. For this reason, only the claimed TCB 
protection properties, TCB interface description, and TCB 
element list are required to enable functional testing. 

The intent of the operational support assurance for this 
package is to establish a minimal level of user and 
administrative guidance and product information that enables 
the correct product installation, use of product security 
features, and remediation of flaws. 

The development evidence required for this package is 
commensurate with the assurances required. The intent of this 
package is to require the type of assurance evidence that is 
generated during the normal commercial development process.

 The intent of evaluation support assurance is to establish 
that the product, and the context in which it is developed and 
supported, is commensurate with the development assurance 
requirements. At the T1 level, testing analysis and the 
requirement for independent testing determines whether the 
product minimally meets the functional protection 
requirements. Operational support evaluation assurance 
determines whether the product documentation correctly 
describes the security relevant operations.

The following table  summarizes the generic assurance 
components that comprise the minimal development assurance 
package (T1):

4.1	TCB Property Definition

The definition of TCB properties assures the consistency of 
the TCB's behavior. It determines a baseline set of properties 
that can be used by system developers and evaluators to assure 
that the TCB satisfies the defined functional requirements.

For CS1, PD-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

PD-1 Property Description

The developer shall interpret the functional 
requirements of the protection profile within the 
product TCB. For each functional requirement, the 
developer shall: (1) identify the TCB elements and 
their TCB interfaces (if any) that implement that 
requirement; (2) describe the operation of these 
TCB elements, and (3) explain why the operation of 
these elements is consistent with the functional 
requirement. 

4.2	TCB Element Identification

The identification of TCB elements (hardware, firmware, 
software, code, and data structures) provides the set of 
elements that determine the protection characteristics of a 
product. All assurance methods rely on the correct 
identification of TCB elements either directly or indirectly.

For CS1, ID-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 ID-1: TCB Element Identification

The developer shall identify the TCB elements 
(i.e., software, hardware/firmware code and data 
structures). Each element must be unambiguously 
identified by its name, type, release, and version 
number (if any).

4.3	TCB Interface Definition

The TCB interface establishes the boundary between the TCB 
and its external users and application programs. It consists 
of several components, such as command interfaces (i.e., user 
oriented devices such as the keyboard and mouse), application 
program interfaces (system calls), and machine/processor 
interfaces (processor instructions).

For CS1, IF-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 IF-1: Interface Description

The developer shall describe all external (e.g., 
command, software, and I/O) administrative (i.e., 
privileged) and non-administrative interfaces to 
the TCB. The description shall include those 
components of the TCB that are implemented as 
hardware and/or firmware if their properties are 
visible at the TCB interface.

The developer shall identify all call conventions 
(e.g., parameter order, call sequence 
requirements) and exceptions signaled at the TCB 
interface.

4.4	Developer Functional Testing

Functional testing establishes that the TCB interface 
exhibits the properties necessary to satisfy the requirements 
of the protection profile. It provides assurance that the TCB 
satisfies at least its functional protection requirements.

For CS1, FT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 FT-1: Conformance Testing

The developer shall test the TCB interface to show 
that all claimed protection functions work as 
stated in the TCB interface description.

The developer shall correct all flaws discovered 
by testing and shall retest the TCB until the 
protection functions are shown to work as claimed.

4.5	User's Guidance

User's guidance is an operational support assurance 
component that ensures that usage constraints assumed by the 
protection profile are understood by the users of the product. 
It is the primary means available for providing product users 
with the necessary background and specific information on how 
to correctly use the product's protection functionality.

For CS1, UG-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 UG-1: Users' Guide

The developer shall provide a User Guide which 
describes all protection services provided and 
enforced by the TCB. The User Guide shall describe 
the interaction between these services and provide 
examples of their use. The User Guide may be in the 
form of a summary, chapter or manual. The User 
Guide shall specifically describe user 
responsibilities. These shall encompass any user 
responsibilities identified in the protection 
profile.

4.6	Administrative Guidance

Administrative guidance is an operation support assurance 
component that ensures that the environmental constraints 
assumed by the protection profile are understood by 
administrative users and operators of the IT product. It is 
the primary means available to the developer for providing to 
administrators and operators detailed, accurate information 
on how to configure and install the product, operate the IT 
product is a secure manner, make effective use of the 
product's privileges and protection mechanisms to control 
access to administrative functions and data bases, and to 
avoid pitfalls and improper use of the administrative 
functions that would compromise the TCB and user security.

For CS1, AG-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 AG-1: Basic Administrative Guidance

The developer shall provide a Trusted Facility 
Manual intended for the product administrators 
that describes how to use the TCB security 
services (e.g., Access Control, System Entry, or 
Audit) to enforce a system security policy. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall include the 
procedures for securely configuring, starting, 
maintaining, and halting the TCB. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall explain how to analyze audit 
data generated by the TCB to identify and document 
user and administrator violations of this policy. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain the 
privileges and functions of administrators. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall describe the 
administrative interaction between security 
services.

The Trusted Facility Manual shall be distinct from 
User Guidance, and encompass any administrative 
responsibilities identified in security 
management.

4.7	Evidence of TCB Protection Properties

The documentation of the TCB protection properties includes 
the definition of the functional component requirements, 
their modeling (if any), and their interpretation within a 
product's TCB. For each requirement of a protection profile, 
a description, definition (an informal, descriptive 
specification), or a formal specification of the TCB 
components and their operation corresponding to the 
requirement must be provided.

For CS1, EPP-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPP-1 Evidence of TCB Correspondence to the Functional 
Requirements

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. The TCB properties, which 
are defined by this correspondence, shall be 
explained in this documentation.

4.8	Evidence of Product Development

Product development evidence consists of the TCB design 
evidence including the documentation of the TCB interface, TCB 
elements, TCB structure, TCB structuring support, and TCB 
design disciplines. The TCB implementation evidence includes 
TCB source code, and the processor hardware and firmware 
specifications.

For CS1, EPD-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPD-1: Description Of The TCB External Interface

The developer shall provide an accurate 
description of the functions, effects, exceptions 
and error messages visible at the TCB interface.

The developer shall provide a list of the TCB 
elements (hardware, software, and firmware).

4.9	Evidence of Functional Testing

Functional testing evidence includes the testing itself, 
the test plans, and test documentation results. Test plans 
consist of: the description definition or specification of the 
test conditions; the test data, which consists of the test 
environment set-up; the test parameters and expected 
outcomes; and a description of the test coverage. 

For CS1, EFT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EFT-1: Evidence of Conformance Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of the 
functional testing that includes the test plan, 
the test procedures, and the results of the 
functional testing.



4.10	Test Analysis

Test analysis determines whether the product meets the 
functional protection requirements defined in the protection 
profile. Functional testing is based on operational product, 
the TCB's functional properties, the product's operational 
support guidance, and other producer's documentation as 
defined by the development evidence requirements. Functional 
test analysis is based on the achieved test results as 
compared to the expected results derived from the development 
evidence.

For CS1, TA-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 TA-1: Elementary Test Analysis

The evaluator shall assess whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for functional testing and 
whether the producer has documented these 
activities as defined in the development evidence 
requirements of the protection profile. The 
evaluator shall analyze the results of the 
producer's testing activities for completeness of 
coverage and consistency of results. The evaluator 
shall determine whether the product's protection 
properties, as described in the product 
documentation have been tested. The evaluator 
shall assess testing results to determine whether 
the product's TCB works as claimed.

4.11	Independent Testing 

Independent testing determines whether the product's TCB 
meets the functional protection requirements as defined in the 
functionality chapter of this Protection Profile. Testing is 
based on the operational product, the TCB's functional 
properties, the product's operational support guidance, and 
other producer's documentation as defined by the Development 
Evidence requirements.

For CS1, IT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 IT-1: Elementary Independent Testing

A tester, independent of the producer or 
evaluator, shall perform functional and elementary 
penetration testing. This testing shall be based 
on the product's user and administrative 
documentation, and on relevant known penetration 
flaws. Satisfactory completion consists of 
demonstrating that all user-visible security 
enforcing functions and security-relevant 
functions work as described in the product's user 
and administrative documentation and that no 
discrepancies exist between the documentation and 
the product. Test results of the producer shall be 
confirmed by the results of independent testing. 
The evaluator may selectively reconfirm any test 
result.

If the independent testing is performed at beta-
test sites, the producer shall supply the beta-
test plan and the test results. The evaluator 
shall review the scope and depth of beta testing 
with respect to the required protection 
functionality, and shall verify independence of 
both the test sites and the producer's and beta-
test user's test results. The evaluator shall 
confirm that the test environment of the beta-test 
site(s) adequately represents the environment 
specified in the protection profile.


COMMERCIAL SECURITY 2 (CS2)

CS2 compliant products provide protection beyond 
those of the CS1 Protection Profile by providing for 
the separation of administrative functions and 
access controls based on groups and access control 
lists (ACLs). Identification and authentication 
mechanisms include support for a rigorous password 
management program (if desired). System entry and 
availability and recovery requirements are also 
specified. Secure administrative tools are 
included, audit mechanisms are expanded, and data 
reduction tools are listed.

CS2 Rationale

2.12	Introduction

As outlined in the Federal Criteria, this rationale 
describes the protection philosophy, how the security 
features are intended to be used, the assumptions about the 
environment in which a compliant product is intended to 
operate, the threats within that environment, and the security 
features and assurances that counter these threats. At the CS2 
level, the features used to counter threats and the strength 
of the assurance evidence is enhanced over CS1 and is 
indicated in the text through bold italics.

2.12.1	Protection Philosophy

Any discussion of protection necessarily starts from a 
protection philosophy, i.e., what it really means to call the 
product "secure." In general, products will control access to 
information and other resources through the use of specific 
security features so that only properly authorized 
individuals or processes acting on their behalf will be 
granted access. For CS1, three fundamental requirements are 
derived for this statement of protection:

o	Access authorization

o	Accountability

o	Assurance 

The totality of the functionality that enforces the access 
authorization and accountability protection philosophy is 
comprised of the hardware, software, and firmware of the 
Trusted Computing Base (TCB). CS2 requires the TCB to be self-
protecting and resistant to bypass so that it is effective at 
countering identified threats. CS2 also requires effective 
management of security attributes and configuration 
parameters. The assurance protection philosophy is comprised 
of the development process, operational support, development 
evidence, and evaluation process assurances. Each of these are 
explained below.

2.12.1.1	Access Authorization

The access authorization portion of the philosophy of 
protection for this profile addresses subject and object 
access mediation. For CS2 compliant products, access 
authorization has been further refined to include system 
entry, subject and object mediation based on Access Control 
Lists (ACLs), and privileged operations.

2.12.1.1.1	System Entry

CS2 provides the capability for a system administrator to 
establish, maintain, and protect information from 
unauthorized access, and defines the identities of and 
conditions under which users may gain entry into the system. 
These system entry controls are based on user identification, 
time, location, and method of entry. 

2.12.1.1.2	Subject and Object Access Mediation

CS2 provides protected access to resources and objects. As 
defined in the TCSEC and specified in this profile, access 
control permits system users and the processes that represent 
them to allow or disallow to other users access to objects 
under their control:

Access control is "a means of restricting access to 
objects based on the identity of subjects and/or 
groups to which they belong. The controls are 
discretionary in the sense that a subject with a 
certain access permission is capable of passing 
that permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any 
other subject." [1]

These controls permit the granting and revoking of access 
privileges to be left to the discretion of the individual 
users. The creator of the object becomes, by default, the 
owner of the object. The owner can grant access as well as 
specify the mode of access (read, write, execute) to the 
object.

ACLs are defined that can effectively specify, for each 
named object, a list of user identifiers with their respective 
modes of access (read, write, and execute) to that object. 
ACLs allow for control of:

o	objects 

o	access modes that protect these objects

o	specific access permissions to be passed onto 
identified authorized subjects.

CS2 also allows for the specification and maintenance of 
groups. Groups are a convenient means of logically associating 
user identifiers. Groups can be referenced when specifying 
ACLs.

2.12.1.1.3	Privileges

CS2 supports and promotes the separation and use of 
privileges. A privilege enables a subject to perform a 
security relevant operation that, by default, is denied. 
Privileges cover all security aspects of a product. CS2 
compliant products have tightly controlled privilege 
definitions as well as control over subjects that hold 
privileges. 

2.12.1.2	Accountability

The accountability portion of the philosophy of protection 
for this profile addresses user Identification and 
Authentication (I&A), requirements for security auditing, and 
a Trusted Path between a user and the operating system. Each 
of these are explained below.

2.12.1.2.1	Identification and Authentication

User identification is required to support access control 
and security auditing. This includes the capability to 
establish, maintain, and protect a unique identifier for each 
authorized user. User identification is functionally 
dependent on authentication. Authentication is a method of 
validating a person as a legitimate user.

User authentication in most computer systems has been 
provided primarily through the use of passwords. CS2 supports 
a variety of password features that give the product a great 
amount of flexibility in the generation of passwords, in 
password security, password features, and password 
administration. For most products, a great deal of confidence 
is placed on maintaining the privacy of passwords belonging 
to individuals. I&A prevents unauthorized individuals from 
logging into the product, therefore, password management is 
essential to secure product operations. The risk of losing a 
password is addressed within CS2 through promoting the use of 
stringent password management practices.

In addition, CS2 allows for stronger authentication 
approaches. CS2 specifies that a unique identifier be 
associated with each trusted subject such as print spoolers 
and database management system services. It also requires the 
TCB to maintain, protect, and display status information for 
all active users and all enabled or disabled user identities 
or accounts.

2.12.1.2.2	Audit

For most secure products, a capability must exist to audit 
the security relevant events. As each user performs security 
relevant tasks, the product must record the user identifier, 
the action performed, and the result in a security log. For 
CS2 compliant products, a capability is specified to allow an 
system administrator to access and evaluate audit 
information. This capability provides a method of protection 
in the sense that security relevant events that occur within 
a computer system can be logged and the responsible user held 
accountable for his/her actions. Audit trails are used to 
detect and deter penetration of a computer system and to 
reveal activity that identifies misuse.

CS2 provides for an effective audit mechanism by supporting 
the following basic security characteristics. It provides the 
ability to:

o	review the use of I&A mechanisms;

o	discover the introduction of objects into a user's 
address space;

o	discover the deletion of objects; 

o	discover actions taken by computer operators and 
system administrators;

o	audit attempts to violate resource allocation limits;

o	protect the audit data so that access to it is limited 
to system administrators that are authorized to 
examine audit information;

o	discover the use of privileges, such as changing the 
ownership of an object;

o	have the audit mechanism act as a deterrent against 
penetrators or hackers; and

o	use audit reduction tools for assessing the damage 
that may result in the event of a violation of the 
implemented security policy. These tools have the 
capability of selectively reviewing the actions of one 
or more users or groups, actions performed on a 
specific object or system resource, and actions 
associated with specific access control attributes.

2.12.1.3	Assurance

Assurance addresses all areas of product development 
assurance and evaluation assurance. Development assurance 
addresses the development process, operational support, the 
development environment, and the development evidence. 
Development process assurance defines the additional efforts 
that a developer must undertake to satisfy the assurance 
objectives while creating the product. It specifies how the 
TCB should be designed and supported by the implementation as 
well as how it should be tested. Operational support assurance 
defines the documentation of the security features for both 
administrative and non-administrative users as well as 
requirements for TCB flaw remediation and TCB generation. 
Development environment assurance includes requirements for 
defining the product's life cycle and specific features for 
configuration management. Development evidence assurance 
defines the TCB's protection properties, details the 
requirements for product testing and analysis, and defines the 
requirements for product support. Evaluation assurance 
establishes that the product, and the context in which it is 
developed and supported, is commensurate with the development 
assurance requirements.

The T2+ Assurance Package was chosen for CS2. This package 
is indicated as being TS2+ since an additional component was 
included for flaw remediation and for a higher level for 
trusted generation. This level is intended to include most 
commercial computer products that are designed to satisfy 
functional requirements. Although most development assurance 
components are required at their lowest levels, the 
requirements of several product development components are 
extended to capture (1) specific TCB properties, and (2) a 
rudimentary notion of support for product structure. The 
operational support component is also extended to enable 
systematic flaw discovery, tracking, and repair.

The intent of the product development assurance for this 
package is to establish that the external behavior of the 
product conforms to its user level and administrative 
documentation without analysis of the internal structure of 
the product TCB. For this reason, only the claimed TCB 
protection properties and their informal models, TCB 
interface description, and TCB element list are required to 
enable functional and penetration testing. Support for TCB 
structuring is limited to process isolation and separation of 
the protection critical TCB elements from the protection non-
critical ones.

The intent of the operational support assurance for this 
package is to establish a minimal level of user and 
administrative guidance and product information that enables 
the correct product installation, use of product security 
features, and remediation of flaws. Similarly, the 
development environment assurances are intended to provide a 
minimal level of control over the product configuration and 
production. This level of development environment assurance 
is similar to that already present in most established 
commercial development organizations.The development evidence 
required for this package is commensurate with the assurances 
required. The intent of this package is to require the type 
of assurance evidence that is generated during the normal 
commercial development process.

At the T2+ level, evaluation support assurance determines 
whether the product meets the functional protection 
requirements for testing analysis and independent testing. 
Operational support evaluation assurance determines whether 
the product documentation correctly describes the security 
relevant operations. 

Also for CS2, flaw remediation was included in this 
assurance package. Flaw remediation is important for 
commercial environments since it ensures that flaws (i.e, 
deficiencies in a product that enables a user external to the 
TCB to violate the functional requirements of a protection 
profile) that are discovered by the product consumers will be 
tracked, corrected, and disseminated to the affected 
customers.

2.12.1.4	Intended Method of Use

All individual users (both administrative and non-
administrative users) are assigned a unique user 
identifier.This user identifier supports individual 
accountability and access control. The operating system 
authenticates the claimed identity of the user before allowing 
the user to perform any further actions. 

Products that comply with the CS2 Protection Profile are 
provided with the capability of assigning privileges to secure 
functions. These privileges are used to control access to 
user, password files, and audit trails. This capability is 
particularly important to prevent a "privileged user" or 
"superuser" from having a wide set of privileges when only a 
subset is needed.

A CS1 compliant product imposes controls on authorized 
users and on processes acting on their behalf to prevent users 
from gaining access to information and other resources for 
which they are not authorized. The product provides the 
capability for users to allow or disallow to other users 
access to objects under their control. The objects are files 
that may be read or written to or programs which may be 
executed. The granularity of control is to the level of 
individual users (although groups made up of individual users 
may be specified) and individual objects. CS1 access controls 
permit the granting and revoking of access to be left to the 
discretion of the individual users.

Products that comply with CS2 specifications are intended 
to be used within the following operational constraints:

o	The information system is designed to be administered 
as a unique entity by a single organization.

o	The information system is designed to manage 
computing, storage, input/output, and to control the 
sharing of resources among multiple users and computer 
processes.

o	The administrative and non-administrative users are 
identified as distinct individuals.

o	The granting and revoking of access control 
permissions (read, write, execute, and deny) are left 
to the discretion of individual users.

o	The information system provides facilities for real-
time interaction with users that have access to input/
output devices.

2.12.2	Environmental Assumptions

A product designed to meet the CS2 Protection Profile is 
intended to be a general purpose, multi-user operating system 
that runs on either a workstation, minicomputer, or mainframe. 
CS2 compliant products are expected to be used in both 
commercial and government environments. The information being 
processed may be unclassified, sensitive-but-unclassified, or 
single-level classified, but not multi-level classified 
information.

The following specific environmental conditions have been 
assumed in specifying CS2:

o	The product hardware base (e.g., CPU, printers, 
terminals, etc.), firmware, and software will be 
protected from unauthorized physical access.

o	There will be one or more personnel assigned to manage 
the product including the security of the information 
it contains.

o	The operational environment will be managed according 
to the operational environment documentation that is 
required in the assurance chapter of the Protection 
Profile.

o	The IT product provides a cooperative environment for 
users to accomplish some task or group of tasks.

o	The processing resources of the IT product, including 
all terminals, are assumed to be located within user 
spaces that have physical access controls established.

o	The IT product provides facilities for some or all of 
the authorized users to create programs that use an 
Application Programming Interface (API) to enable them 
to protect themselves and their objects from 
unauthorized use.

o	Fail-safe defaults are included for the access control 
attributes for the defined subjects and objects for 
the product.

2.12.3	Expected Threats

In general, the choice of which Protection Profile to 
choose depends upon the level of security that is required for 
that particular organizational environment. The lowest level, 
the CS1 level, is intended for those commercial and government 
environments where all the system personnel are trusted and 
all the data on the system is at the same classification 
level. For example, a government agency where all personnel 
has a government clearance, all data is unclassified, and 
there is no outside network connections would be an ideal 
candidate for CS1, i.e., the threats to be countered are such 
that only a minimal level of trust is needed. However, most 
commercial and government environments are more complex and 
require a higher degree of trust. CS2 addresses the security 
needs for the main stream commercial and government 
environments. It provides a higher level of trust for those 
organizations that need to enforce a security policy where 
there is no need for different classifications of data. CS3 
is intended to provide the highest level of trust for 
commercial and government environments. It is intended to be 
used in those environments where a great deal of trust is 
required, such as in law enforcement agencies, nuclear 
facilities, or commercial airports. It provides the strongest 
features, mechanisms, and assurances to counter these 
threats.

A product that is designed to meet the CS2 Protection 
Profile and operate within its assumed environment will 
provide capabilities to counter these threats. It should be 
noted, however, that although a product may faithfully 
implement all the features and assurances specified in this 
Protection Profile, the complete elimination of any one threat 
should not be assumed. A product that is designed to meet the 
CS2 Protection Profile is generally known to be more effective 
at countering the threats than products that meet the CS1 
Protection Profile. CS2 products counter all the CS1 threats, 
and contain stronger features and more assurance evidence than 
CS1 products. In addition to countering CS1 threats, CS2 
compliant products provide protection capabilities to counter 
four additional threats:

1.	AN UNAUTHORIZED USER MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE 
SYSTEM

For CS1 compliant products, the threat of an unauthorized 
user gaining access to the system is primarily addressed by 
I&A. I&A features allow the TCB to verify the identity of 
individuals attempting to gain access to the system. This is 
accomplished through the use of passwords.

Although not a direct countermeasure, auditing requirements 
are specified at the CS1 level to provide the capability to 
perform an after-the-fact analysis of unauthorized system 
entry and login attempts. This provides an opportunity for the 
system administrators to take corrective actions, such as 
strengthening existing user authentication methods or 
requiring users to change their passwords.

For CS2 compliant systems, the threat of an unauthorized 
user gaining access to the system is primarily addressed by 
stronger I&A features and system entry requirements. 

CS2 specifies password requirements that promote a strong 
organizational password management program. These 
requirements specify that: null passwords cannot be used 
during normal operations; passwords be stored in a one-way 
encrypted form; the clear text representation of a password 
be automatically suppressed; passwords have a minimum-length; 
and that the system utilize a password complexity-checking 
algorithm. An advisory capability is also provided to exclude 
a list of customer-specified passwords. Such requirements 
support the use of passwords that are effective against 
password guessing. To further reduce the probability of a 
password being guessed, requirements limit the number of 
attempted login attempts that can be made by a user associated 
with a specific user identifier. The probability of a single 
password being guessed is further reduced by requirements for 
password aging, by having limitations on password reuse, and 
by allowing users to choose a password that is already 
associated with another user identifier. 

CS2 also allows for a password generating capability. 
Because random passwords can be difficult to remember and 
users are tempted to write them down, requirements are 
specified for the generation of passwords that are easy to 
remember (i.e., pronounceable). Additionally, an advisory 
requirement is specified to allow users to choose from a list 
of alternative passwords.

To minimize the threat that a password has been 
compromised, a requirement exists to allow a user to change 
the password. Because a password can be compromised by 
observing the characters on a terminal screen as it is being 
typed, there is a requirement to blot out the clear-text 
representation of the password on the display device.

In addition, requirements are specified to display an 
advisory warning message to all users prior to system logon 
to discourage a would-be system penetrator from attempting an 
unauthorized system entry. Such a message can also provide a 
basis for subsequent prosecution. System entry requirements 
also specify additional controls on identified and 
authenticated users entering the system. Once a user is 
authenticated, a check is made to determine if the user is 
allowed further entry. System entry is granted only in 
accordance with the authenticated user's access control 
attributes. These conditions are in terms of a user's identity 
and his/her membership in groups (if they exist). In addition, 
CS2 specifies system entry requirements to display to an 
authorized user, upon successful system entry, the date and 
time, method of access or port of entry, and the number of 
failed logon attempts since the last successful system entry 
by that user identifier. These requirements provide a user 
with the capability to detect attempted or successful system 
penetrations. In addition, requirements are specified to lock 
and terminate an interactive session after an administrator-
specified period of user inactivity, and also for the TCB to 
appear to perform the entire user authentication procedure 
even if the user identification entered is invalid. The TCB 
also provides a protected mechanism to allow or deny system 
entry based on specified ranges of time. Also, conditions for 
system entry via dial-up lines are required to be specified.

I&A requirements are also enhanced over those of CS1 by 
specifying requirements for the identification for each 
trusted user, and by specifying requirements for system 
administrators to disable a user's identity or account when 
the number of unsuccessful logon attempts exceeds an 
administrator specified threshold. This is intended to 
mitigate the effectiveness of successive attacks of system 
penetration. 

2.	AN AUTHORIZED USER MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO 
RESOURCES WHEN THE USER IS NOT ALLOWED ACCESS

An authorized user can try to gain access to unauthorized 
resources by assuming the user identifier of another user and 
thus gaining their associated access rights. This is addressed 
through the use of passwords.

Once an authorized user has gained access to the system, 
the threat still remains for a user to gain access to 
resources when the user is not authorized. At the resource 
level, CS2 specifies access control features to mediate (i.e., 
distribute, review, and revoke) user access to a subset of 
resources. 

The object reuse feature has been specified to ensure that 
resource contents are cleared before they are reused. This 
reduces the vulnerability that the resource contents can be 
read before it is overwritten. 

To address the vulnerability associated with passwords, CS2 
specifies password requirements that promote a strong 
organizational password management program. Besides those 
password requirements that address penetration threats from 
unauthorized users, other password requirements have been 
specified to counter the threat of an insider (authorized 
user) attack. There are password requirements that specify 
that passwords must always be stored in encrypted format and 
that passwords can never be included in audit trail data. 
Also, in the event that a user selects a password that is 
already in use by another user, requirements disallow the 
system from acknowledging the dual association.

In addition, CS2 specifies access control features to limit 
the user identifiers that may change to another user 
identifier that provides any additional privileges to that 
user. These controls are based on the user identifier and the 
mode of access (i.e., read, write, and execute). Also, 
administrators are provided with capabilities through the use 
of protected mechanisms to set and control security related 
parameters, defaults, thresholds, attributes, and other 
security related data. This provides the ability to 
effectively specify and control access to resources based on 
site specific protection policies. 

CS2 also specifies that privileges must be associated with 
TCB functions, TCB calls, and accesses to privileged TCB 
objects (e.g., user and group registration files. password 
files, audit log files). 

CS2 specifies requirements for a direct communication 
channel, i.e., a trusted path, between the user and the 
operating system to counter spoofing threats. This security 
feature provides confidence that a user at a terminal will 
communicate directly with the TCB rather than to malicious 
code. In particular, to counter the threat of an authorized 
user creating a spoof of legitimate user identifier 
authorization prompts, CS2 specifies requirements for a 
direct communication path between the user and the 
authentication system.

Requirements are also specified to display an advisory 
warning message to all users prior to system logon to 
discourage unauthorized system entry. Such a message can also 
provide a basis for subsequent prosecution.

Once an authorized user has been identified and 
authenticated, system entry control can help counter threats 
of inadvertent, deliberate, and coerced entry performed in an 
unauthorized manner by an authorized user. At the end of 
system entry control, the user bears the access-control 
attributes determined during the I&A process, provided that 
the system entry conditions are satisfied. These conditions 
can be specified in terms of a user's identity, group 
membership, or mode of access.

CS2 also provides other security features. Application 
programming interfaces are provided so that applications can 
protect themselves and their objects from unauthorized use. 
CS2 specifies lists of user identities authorized to enter the 
system via dial-up lines. CS2 also specifies general 
authentication facilities for use by application developers, 
system administrators, and users for the protection of 
resources.

3.	SECURITY RELEVANT ACTIONS MAY NOT BE TRACEABLE TO THE 
USER ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVENT

CS2 accountability and audit requirements are specified to 
provide the capability to track security relevant actions 
performed by users, and link such actions, if possible, to the 
responsible identifier. Audit mechanisms are responsible for 
the monitoring and detecting of real or potential security 
violations or events. These audit events can include 
successful or unsuccessful: I&A events, the introduction of 
objects into a user's address space, the deletion of objects, 
and actions taken by system administrators. Each audit record 
includes the date, time, location, type of event, identity of 
the user and object involved, and the success or failure of 
the event. 

Requirements are specified to protect audit trail data and 
the audit control mechanism from unauthorized access, 
modification, or destruction. Audit features are specified to 
provide post-collection audit analysis on specific data 
items, users, and privileged operations. Also, a capability 
is provided for trusted application programs to append data 
to the security audit trail. 

System entry control helps to enhance accountability by 
providing a time, space, and mode-of-entry context to each 
action for which the user is held accountable. These added 
constraints help to give additional assurance that the proper 
user is held responsible for a set of authorized actions.

At the CS2 level, tools are specified to enhance the 
effectiveness of user accountability. CS3 specifies 
requirements to provide tools to verify the consistency of the 
audit trial data and the selection of audit events. Tools are 
also specified for post-collection analysis to selectively 
review various actions. 

4.	THE PRODUCT MAY BE DELIVERED, INSTALLED, AND THEN USED 
IN AN UNSECURED MANNER

This threat is countered by explicitly requiring that the 
product be delivered with all security features turned on. 
This ensures that the product is secure by default rather than 
insecure by default. This is complemented by allowing many 
security features to be configurable so that, as a specific 
organization gains experience with the actual threats in its 
environment, the organization can adjust the degree of 
security in their system. There are several requirements that 
reinforce the "security by default" perspective during 
initial installation. Requirements for security 
administrative documentation are specified to increase the 
likelihood that the administrator will install and start the 
system in a secure manner.

5.	SECURITY BREACHES MAY OCCUR BECAUSE AVAILABLE SECURITY 
FEATURES ARE NOT USED OR ARE USED IMPROPERLY

Requirements for authentication, system and access control, 
security management, and product documentation provide a 
basis for countering this threat. Authentication requirements 
provide for password management procedures to reduce the 
possibility of easy to guess passwords and to initialize 
passwords for users. Password generation algorithms are 
provided that generate easy to remember passwords and that 
give the user a choice of passwords. In addition, CS2 provides 
for a capability to import and export objects and subjects 
with defined access control attributes. This ensures that 
access control attributes are maintained with the subject or 
object during import and export operations.

Security management requirements are specified for listing, 
setting, and updating all of the system security parameters 
and attributes. These parameters and attributes pertain to 
identification, authentication, system entry, access control, 
audit trail analysis and availability features for the system 
and for individual users. This allows a system administrator 
to confirm that the system is properly configured and, if 
necessary, to modify the existing configuration and 
attributes. In addition, security management requirements 
provide for routine control and maintenance of system 
resources.

Product documentation requirements for users and 
administrators describe how to perform security relevant 
functions in a secure manner.

6.	SECURITY BREACHES MAY OCCUR BECAUSE OF TCB PENETRATION

TCB protection is a fundamental capability of CS compliant 
products. The security components and mechanisms described in 
this Protection Profile depend upon the integrity of the TCB 
and on the TCB being isolated and non-circumventable. CS1 
specifies requirements for a common and basic set of security 
features to protect the TCB from outside penetration.

This threat is also countered through product assurance. 
The TCB interface definition establishes the boundary between 
the TCB and its internal users. Security functional testing 
establishes that these TCB definitions and properties satisfy 
the requirements of the Protection Profile. 

7.	USERS MAY BE ABLE TO BYPASS THE SECURITY FEATURES OF 
THE SYSTEM

This threat is countered by authentication, access control, 
audit, TCB isolation, TCB non-circumventability, and 
reference mediation requirements. Authentication requirements 
protect authentication data from unauthorized users. Resource 
access control requirements protect access control data.

Audit requirements provide for the logging of successful 
and unsuccessful accesses to resources as well as for changes 
made to the system security configuration and system software 
in the event that the system security features have been 
bypassed.

CS1 specifications for reference mediation protects the 
integrity of the access control mechanism and the TCB's 
functionality. Starting at CS1, requirements exist for TCB 
mediation of user references to objects and to security 
relevant services. 

CS1-compliant products maintain a domain for its own 
execution to protect it from external interference and 
tampering. Such requirements address TCB isolation and non-
circumventability of TCB isolation functions. 

This threat is also countered through product assurance. 
The definition of TCB properties assures the consistency of 
the TCB's behavior. The identification of TCB elements 
provides the set of elements that determine the protection 
characteristics of a product. The TCB interface definition 
establishes the boundary between the TCB and its internal 
users. Security functional testing establishes that these TCB 
definitions and properties satisfy the requirements of this 
Protection Profile, and provide evidence against users being 
able to bypass the security features of the system. At the CS2 
level, procedures also have to be established for developers 
to accept customer reports of protection problems and requests 
for corrections to those problems. Also, when the product is 
delivered, all security related parameters must be set to its 
fail-safe defaults.

8.	SUBJECTS MAY BE DENIED CONTINUED ACCESSIBILITY TO THE 
RESOURCES OF THE SYSTEM (I.E., DENIAL OF SERVICE)

Reliability of service requirements promote the continued 
accessibility of system resources by authorized subjects. 
These requirements principally counter threats related to 
intentional or unintentional denial of service attacks. The 
requirements include detecting and reporting facilities, 
controls to limit systematically the disabling of user 
identifiers, mechanisms for recovery in the event of a system 
crash, resource quotas, and data backup and restoration. In 
particular, mechanisms are specified for recovery and system 
start-up, and for a maintenance mode of operation.

CS2 compliant systems provide the capability to detect and 
recover from discontinuity of service using some combination 
of automatic and procedural techniques. This capability is 
intended to counter the threat that subjects may be denied 
continued accessibility to the resources of the system (i.e., 
denial of service). Also, users are notified in advance to 
change their password, so that access to the system is not 
denied without warning. An advisory capability exists to allow 
an system administrator to use null passwords during system 
start-up. This allows a system administrator to access the 
system even if the password mechanism has been compromised. 
In addition, audit trails are compressed to avoid excessive 
consumption of disk space. 

9.	THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM MAY BE COMPROMISED

At the CS2 level, requirements are specified for TCB 
recovery and start-up to promote the secure state of the 
system in the event of a system failure or discontinuity of 
service. These features are intended to minimize the 
likelihood of the loss of user objects during system recovery.

To protect audit trail data, a mechanism is specified to 
automatically copy the audit trail file to an alternative 
storage area. 

CS2 compliant products also provide the capability to 
validate the correct operation of the TCB software, firmware, 
and hardware. Such features are important to ensure that the 
software, hardware, and firmware are in working order. 

CS2 Functionality 

3.	Introduction

This section provides detailed functionality requirements 
that must be satisfied by a Commercial Security 2 (CS2) 
compliant product. Note that all plain text are words taken 
directly from the Federal Criteria. Any assignments or 
refinements made to the text in the Federal Criteria's are 
indicated by bold italics. A Protection Profile requirement 
is an assignment when it is directly taken as stated from the 
Federal Criteria component without change or when a binding 
is made to a Federal Criteria threshold definition. A 
Protection Profile requirement is a refinement when the 
Federal Criteria requirement is taken to a lower level of 
abstraction. The characterization of Protection Profile 
requirements as being either assignments or refinements can 
be found at each component level. Also, note that, unlike the 
Federal Criteria, there are some items that are considered to 
be "advisory," i.e., an item marked advisory is a desirable 
feature but is not required for that component. Each advisory 
item is marked with an "(A)".

This Protection Profile for CS2 utilizes the following 
levels from the Federal Criteria. Note that not all the 
components from the Federal Criteria are reflected in this 
Protection Profile; there are no specific requirements for 
those components that are not listed. Also note that a "+" 
after the component level number indicates that a requirement 
was included from a higher level of that component.

3.1	Identification & Authentication 

All users of the product must be identified and 
authenticated. A login process is established that interacts 
with the user in order to provide the information necessary 
for identification and authentication. The identification and 
authentication process begins the user's interaction with the 
target product. First, the user supplies a unique user 
identifier to the TCB. Then, the user is asked to authenticate 
that claimed identity by the TCB. The user identifier is used 
for both access control and also for accountability. 
Therefore, the proper maintenance and control of the 
identification mechanism and the identification databases are 
vital to TCB security. Once a user has supplied an identifier 
to the TCB, the TCB must verify that the user really 
corresponds to the claimed identifier. This is done by the 
authentication mechanism as described by the following 
requirements. 

 For the CS2 level, I&A-3 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. This I&A component level has been refined from the 
Federal Criteria by requiring that only system administrators 
perform certain actions. Password requirements have also been 
refined to reflect the importance of this protected mechanism 
to commercial products. An additional refinement was made 
regarding invalid user identification on error feedback. 
Assignments were made for default thresholds for the number 
of login attempts and login time intervals.

 I&A-3 Exception-Controlled Identification and 
Authentication

1.	 The TCB shall require users to identify 
themselves to it before beginning to perform any 
other actions that the TCB is expected to mediate. 
The TCB shall be able to enforce individual 
accountability by providing the capability to 
uniquely identify each individual user. The TCB 
shall also provide the capability of associating 
this identity with all auditable actions taken by 
that individual.

2. 	The TCB shall maintain authentication data that 
includes information for verifying the identity of 
individual users (e.g., passwords) as well as 
information for determining the product policy 
attributes of individual users, i.e. groups. These 
data shall be used by the TCB to authenticate the 
user's identity and to ensure that the attributes 
of subjects external to the TCB that may be 
created to act on behalf of the individual user 
satisfy the product policy. The control of user 
identification data shall be limited to system 
administrators, except that a user shall be 
allowed to modify his/her own authentication data 
within prescribed limits (e.g., changing his/her 
own password).

3. 	The TCB shall protect authentication data so 
that it cannot be used by any unauthorized user. 
The TCB shall appear to perform the entire user 
authentication procedure even if the user 
identification entered is invalid. Error feedback 
shall contain no information regarding which part 
of the authentication information is incorrect.

The TCB shall end the attempted login session if 
the user performs the authentication procedure 
incorrectly for a number of successive times 
(i.e., a threshold) specified by an authorized 
system administrator. The default threshold shall 
be three times. When the threshold is exceeded, 
the TCB shall send an alarm message to the system 
console and/or to the administrator's terminal, 
log this event in the audit trail, and delay the 
next login by an interval of time specified by the 
authorized system administrator. The default time 
interval shall be 60 seconds. The TCB shall 
provide a protected mechanism to disable the user 
identity or account when the threshold of 
successive, unsuccessful login attempts is 
violated more than a number of times specified by 
the administrator. By default, this mechanism 
shall be disabled (as it may cause unauthorized 
denial of service).

4. 	The TCB shall have the capability to maintain, 
protect, and display status information for all 
active users (e.g., users currently logged on, 
current policy attributes) and of all user 
accounts (i.e., enabled or disabled user identity 
or account). 

5. Whenever passwords are used as a protection 
mechanism, then, at a minimum:

a.	The TCB shall not indicate to the user if he/she 
has chosen a password already associated with 
another user. 

b.	The TCB shall store passwords in a one-way 
encrypted form. 

(1)	The TCB shall require privilege to access 
encrypted passwords. 

c.	The TCB shall automatically suppress or fully 
blot out the clear-text representation of the 
password on the data entry/display device. 

d.	The TCB shall, by default, prohibit the use of 
null passwords during normal operation. 

(1)	A capability, accessible only to an system 
administrator, to allow null passwords during 
non-normal operations, such as system start-
up, manual recovery, or maintenance mode, on a 
per-user identifier or per-port basis may be 
provided. (A)

e.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
allow a user to change his or her password. This 
mechanism shall require re-authentication of the 
user identity. 

(1)	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
set or initialize passwords for users. The use 
of this mechanism shall be limited to system 
administrators.   

f.	The TCB shall enforce password aging on a per-
user identifier or per-group basis (i.e., a user 
shall be required to change his or her password 
after a system-specifiable minimum time). The 
default for all non-system administrators shall 
be sixty days. 

(1)	The default for system administrator 
identifiers shall be thirty days. 

(2)	After the password aging threshold has been 
reached, the password shall no longer be 
valid, except as provided in 5 g below. 

The control of password aging shall be limited to 
system administrators. 

g.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
notify users in advance of requiring them to 
change their passwords. This can be done by 
either:

(1)	Notifying users a system-specifiable period 
of time prior to their password expiring. The 
default shall be seven days. 

- or -

(2)	Upon password expiration, notifying the user 
but allowing a system-specifiable subsequent 
number of additional logons prior to requiring 
a new password. The default shall be two 
additional logons. 

The control of user password expiration defaults 
shall be limited to system administrators. 

h.	Passwords shall not be reusable by the same user 
identifier for a system-specifiable period of 
time. The default shall be six months. The 
control of password re-use shall be limited to 
system administrators. 

i.	The TCB shall provide an algorithm for ensuring 
the complexity of user-entered passwords that 
meets the following requirements:

(1)	Passwords shall meet a system-specifiable 
minimum length requirement. The default 
minimum length shall be eight characters. 

(2)	The password complexity-checking algorithm 
shall be modifiable by the TCB. The default 
algorithm shall require passwords to include 
at least one alphabetic character, one numeric 
character, and one special character. 

(3)	The TCB should provide a protected mechanism 
that allows systems to specify a list of 
excluded passwords (e.g., company acronyms, 
common surnames). (A)

(a)	The TCB should prevent users from selecting 
a password that matches any of those on the 
list of excluded passwords. (A)

The control of password complexity shall be limited 
to system administrators. 

j.	If password generation algorithms are present, 
they shall meet the following requirements:

(1)	The password generation algorithm shall 
generate passwords that are easy to remember 
(i.e., pronounceable). 

(2)	The TCB should give the user a choice of 
alternative passwords from which to choose. 
(A)

(3)	Passwords shall be reasonably resistant to 
brute-force password guessing attacks. 

(4)			If the "alphabet" used by the password 
generation algorithm consists of syllables 
rather than characters, the security of the 
password shall not depend on the secrecy of the 
alphabet. 

(5)	The generated sequence of passwords shall have 
the property of randomness (i.e., consecutive 
instances shall be uncorrelated and the 
sequences shall not display periodicity). 

3.2	System Entry 

Once a user is authenticated, a check is made to see if the 
user is allowed to enter the product. The qualifying checks 
for system entry at the SE-2 level can include time-of-day, 
day-of-week, date, location of terminal, or means of access 
(e.g., dial-up port). 

For the CS2 level, SE-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. This component has been refined from the Federal 
Criteria by specifying a default advisory warning to be 
displayed before user logon, by limiting the control of system 
entry requirements to system administrators, and by further 
limiting the use of protected mechanisms to system 
administrators. Also, default values for terminal locking and 
session termination and for user policy attributes were 
assigned.

 SE-2 Time and Location Based Entry Control

1. 	Prior to initiating the system login procedure, 
the TCB shall display an advisory warning message 
to the user regarding unauthorized use of the 
system and the possible consequences of failure to 
heed this warning.

a.	The message shall be system-specifiable. 

b.	The TCB shall be able to display a message of up 
to twenty lines in length. 

c.	The following message shall be displayed by 
default: 

"NOTICE: This is a private computer system. 
All users of this system are subject to 
having their activities audited. Anyone 
using this system consents to such 
auditing. All unauthorized entries or 
activities revealed by this auditing can be 
used as evidence and may lead to criminal 
prosecution." 

The control of system entry messages shall be 
limited to system administrators. 

2. 	Before system entry is granted to a user, the 
identity of that user shall be authenticated by 
the TCB. If the TCB is designed to support 
multiple login sessions per user identity, the TCB 
shall provide a protected mechanism to enable 
limiting the number of login sessions per user 
identity or account with a default of a single 
login session. The control of this mechanism to 
limit the number of login sessions shall be 
limited to system administrators. 

3. 	The TCB shall grant system entry only in 
accordance with the authenticated user's policy 
attributes. The system entry conditions shall be 
expressed in terms of users' policy attributes, 
i.e., user identity and membership to groups. If 
no explicit system-entry conditions are defined, 
the system-entry default shall be used (e.g., the 
correct user authentication). The TCB shall 
provide a protected mechanism to allow or deny 
system entry based on specified ranges of time. 
Entry conditions using these ranges shall be 
specified using time-of-day, day-of-week, and 
calendar dates. The control of system entry 
conditions shall be limited to system 
administrators. 

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
allow or deny system entry based on location or 
port of entry. Conditions for system entry via 
dial-up lines (e.g., lists of user identities 
authorized to enter the system via dial-up lines), 
if any, shall be specified.The control of these 
mechanisms shall be limited to system 
administrators.

4. 	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism that 
enables authorized administrators to display and 
modify the policy attributes used in system-entry 
control for each user. The conditions under which 
an unprivileged user may display these attributes 
shall be specified.

5.	Upon a user's successful entry to the system, 
the TCB shall display the following data to the 
user and shall not remove them without user 
intervention: (1) the date, time, means of access 
and port of entry of the last successful entry to 
the system; and (2) the number of successive, 
unsuccessful attempts to access the system since 
the last successful entry by the identified user.

6. 	The TCB shall either lock or terminate an 
interactive session after an administrator-
specified interval of user inactivity. The default 
value for the lock interval shall be five minutes. 
The default value for session termination shall be 
fifteen minutes.   

3.3	Trusted Path 

A Trusted Path ensures that users have direct, unencumbered 
communication with the TCB. A Trusted Path may be required at 
various times during a subject session and also may be 
initiated by a user during a TCB interaction.

For the CS2 level, TP-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. This level was refined by requiring that there be a 
direct Trusted Path connection to the authentication 
mechanism. 

 TP-1 Login Trusted Path

The TCB shall support a trusted communication path 
between itself and the user for initial 
identification and authentication. Communications 
via this path shall be initiated exclusively by a 
user.

a.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism by 
which a display device may force a direct 
connection between the port to which it is 
connected and the authentication mechanism. 

3.4	Audit 

Audit supports accountability by providing a trail of user 
actions. Actions are associated with individual users for 
security-relevant events and are stored in an audit trail. 
This audit trail can be examined to determine what happened 
and what user was responsible for a security relevant event. 
The audit trail data must be protected from unauthorized 
access, modification, or destruction. In addition, the audit 
trail data must be available in a useful and timely manner for 
analysis. 

Audit data is recorded from several sources (such as the 
TCB or privileged applications) to produce a complete picture 
of a user's security relevant actions. Therefore, audit data 
must be correlated across audit collection systems. The 
mechanisms providing audit data recording must be tailorable 
to each product's needs. Both the audit data itself and the 
mechanisms to determine what audit data is recorded are 
protected by privileges. Once the audit data is recorded, it 
is analyzed and reported. At the CS2 level, reporting can be 
generated on request. 

For the CS2 level, AD-4 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. This level was refined from the Federal Criteria by 
specifying that: password character strings not be recorded 
in the audit trail; privileged applications be allowed to 
append data to the audit trail; audit trail files be copied 
to an alternative storage area after a system-specifiable 
period of time; the TCB provide a protected mechanism for the 
automatic deletion of security audit trail files. Assignments 
were made to subject to object access control rules so that 
they include user access to disk files, tape volumes, and tape 
files.

AD-3 Audit Tools

1.	The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and 
protect from modification or unauthorized access 
or destruction an audit trail of accesses to the 
objects it protects. The audit data shall be 
protected by the TCB so that read access to it is 
limited to those who are authorized for audit 
data.

The TCB shall support an application program 
interface that allows a privileged application to 
append data to the security audit trail or to an 
applications-specified alternative security audit 
trail. 

The TCB should support an option to maintain the 
security audit trail data in encrypted format. (A)

2.	The TCB shall be able to record the following 
types of events:

	- use of the identification and authentication 
mechanisms, and system entry events;

	- access control events selectable on a per 
user, per subject, per object, per group, and/or 
per policy attribute basis; i.e., introduction of 
objects into a user's address space (e.g., file 
open, program initiation), creation and deletion 
of subjects and objects; distribution and 
revocation of access rights; changes of subject 
and object policy attributes; acquisition and 
deletion of system privileges. 

	-actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators and/or system security officers; 
i.e., privileged operations such as the 
modification of TCB elements; accesses to TCB 
objects (at a minimum, access to an object shall 
include disk file access, tape volume, or tape 
file access); changes of policy attributes of 
users, TCB configuration and security 
characteristics, and system privileges; selection 
and modification of audited events.

The events that are auditable by default, and 
those that are required for successful auditing of 
other events, which may not be disabled, shall be 
defined. The TCB shall provide a protected 
mechanism that displays the currently selected 
events and their defaults. The use of this 
mechanism shall be restricted to authorized system 
administrators.

3.	For each recorded event, the audit record shall 
identify: date and time of the event, user, type 
of event, and success or failure of the event. For 
identification/authentication events the origin of 
request (e.g., terminal ID) shall be included in 
the audit record. For events that introduce an 
object into a user's address space and for object 
deletion events the audit record shall include the 
name and policy attributes of the object.

The character strings input as a response to a 
password prompt shall not be recorded in the 
security audit trail. 

4.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
turn auditing on and off, and to select and change 
the events to be audited and their defaults, 
during the system operation. The use of this 
mechanism shall be restricted to authorized system 
administrators. The system administrator shall be 
able to selectively audit the actions of one or 
more users based on individual identity and/or 
object policy attributes. Audit review tools shall 
be available to authorized system administrators 
to assist in the inspection and review of audit 
data, and shall be protected from unauthorized 
use, modification, or destruction.

The TCB shall provide tools for audit data 
processing. These shall include specifically 
designed tools: for verifying the consistency of 
the audit data; for verifying the selection of 
audit events; for audit trail management. The 
audit trail management tools shall enable:

	- creation, destruction, and emptying of audit 
trails; use of warning points regarding the size 
of the audit data, and modification of the audit 
trail size;

	-formatting and compressing of event records;

	-displaying of formatted audit trail data; and

	-maintaining the consistency of the audit trail 
data after system failures and discontinuity of 
operation.

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism for 
the automatic copying of security audit trail 
files to an alternative storage area after a 
system-specifiable period of time. 

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism for 
the automatic deletion of security audit trail 
files after a system-specifiable period of time. 
The default shall be thirty days. 

(a)	It shall not be possible to delete the 
security audit trail before it gets copied 
to an alternate storage area. 

(b)	It shall be possible to disable this mechanism. 

The use of audit trail management functions shall 
be limited to system administrators. 

5. 	Audit review tools shall be available to 
authorized users to assist in the inspection and 
review of audit data, and shall be protected from 
unauthorized modification or destruction. The TCB 
shall also provide tools for post-collection audit 
analysis (e.g., intrusion detection) that shall be 
able to selectively review (1) the actions of one 
or more users (e.g., identification, 
authentication, system-entry, and access control 
actions); (2) the actions performed on a specific 
object or system resource; and (3) all, or a 
specified set of, audited exceptions; and (4) 
actions associated with a specific policy 
attributes. The review tools shall be able to 
operate concurrently with the system operation.

3.5	Access Control 

Once the user has been granted access, the question of which 
objects that authenticated user may access still remains. An 
owner, or an authorized user, allows or denies to other users 
access to that object. The requirements below describe subject 
accesses to objects. 

For the CS2 level, AC-2+ was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. This level is indicated as being AC-2+ because a 
requirement was included from level AC-4 (the distribution, 
revocation, and review of access control attributes rules). 
This is indicated in the text by an "[AC-4]" in front of the 
requirement.This component level was refined from the Federal 
Criteria by specifying: a protected mechanism for groups; a 
limitation on the changes an active subject can make to a 
privileged user identifier; a definition of an access control 
list; and minimum authorization rules.

 AC-2+ Basic Access Control

1.	Definition of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and protect access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. Subject 
attributes shall include named individuals or 
defined groups or both. Object attributes shall 
include defined access rights (i.e., read, write, 
execute) that can be assigned to subject 
attributes.

The TCB shall be able to assign access rights to 
group identities.

If multiple access control policies are supported, 
the access control attributes corresponding to 
each individual policy shall be identified. 

The subject and/or object attributes shall 
accurately reflect the sensitivity and integrity 
of the subject or object.

2.	Administration of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and enforce rules for 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes for subjects and objects.

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism for 
groups as follows: 

a.	A user identifier shall be able to be associated 
with one or more groups. 

b.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
list the names of all groups. 

c.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
list the membership of any group. 

Rules for maintaining group membership shall be 
provided. These rules shall include those for 
displaying and modifying the list of users 
belonging to a group and the group attributes of 
those users. 

The effect of these rules shall be that access 
permission to an object by users not already 
possessing access permission is assigned only by 
authorized users. 

Only the current owner or system administrators 
shall modify access control attributes on objects.

(a)	There should be a distinct access right to 
modify the contents of an object's access 
control list (e.g., an "ownership" or 
"control" access right). (A)

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
modify group membership. The use of this mechanism 
shall be under the control of system 
administrators. Authority to modify specific group 
membership may be delegated. 

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism by which 
the user identifier associated with a subject 
attribute can be changed while the subject is 
active. It shall also provide a protected mechanism 
for limiting the user identifiers that may change 
to a user identifier that would provide any 
additional access rights. The control of these 
mechanisms shall be limited to system 
administrators. 

[AC-4]: These rules shall allow authorized users 
to specify and control sharing of objects by named 
individuals or defined groups of individuals, or 
by both, and shall provide controls to limit 
propagation of access rights, (i.e., these rules 
shall define the distribution, revocation, and 
review of access control attributes). The controls 
defined by these rules shall be capable of 
specifying for each named object, a list of 
individuals and a list of groups of named 
individuals, with their respective access rights 
to that object. Furthermore, for each named 
object, it shall be possible to specify a list of 
named individuals and a list of groups of named 
individuals for which no access to the object is 
given. These controls shall be capable of 
including or excluding access to the granularity 
of a single user.

The rules for assignment and modification of 
access control attributes shall include those for 
attribute assignment to objects during import and 
export operations. If different rules of 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes apply to different subjects and/or 
objects, the totality of these rules shall be 
shown to support the defined policy.

3.	Authorization of Subject References to Objects

The TCB shall define and enforce authorization 
rules for the mediation of subject references to 
objects. These rules shall be based on the access 
control attributes of subjects and objects. These 
rules shall, either by explicit user action or by 
default, provide that objects are protected from 
unauthorized access. 

For each object, the authorization rules of the TCB 
shall be based on a protected mechanism to specify 
a list of user identifiers or groups with their 
specific access rights to that object (i.e., an 
access control list). 

At a minimum, the authorization rules shall be 
defined as follows:

a.	The access rights associated with a user 
identifier shall take precedence over the access 
rights associated with any groups of which that 
user identifier is a member. 

b.	When a user identifier can be an active member of 
multiple groups simultaneously, or if the access 
rights associated with the user identifier 
conflict with the access rights associated with 
any group in which the user is a member, it shall 
be possible for an system administrator to 
configure rules that combine the access rights to 
make a final access control decision. 

c.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
specify default access rights for user 
identifiers not otherwise specified either 
explicitly by a user identifier or implicitly by 
group membership. 

The scope of the authorization rules shall include 
a defined subset of the product's subjects and 
objects and associated access control attributes. 
The coverage of authorization rules shall specify 
the types of objects and subjects to which these 
rules apply. If different rules apply to different 
subjects and objects, the totality of these rules 
shall be shown to support the defined policy. 

If multiple policies are supported, the 
authorization rules for each policy shall be 
defined separately. The TCB shall define and 
enforce the composition of policies, including the 
enforcement of the authorization rules (e.g., 
subject and object type coverage, enforcement 
precedence).

4.	Subject and Object Creation and Destruction

The TCB shall control the creation and destruction 
of subjects and objects. These controls shall 
include object reuse. That is, all authorizations 
to the information contained within a storage 
object shall be revoked prior to initial 
assignment, allocation or reallocation to a 
subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage 
objects; information, including encrypted 
representations of information, produced by a 
prior subjects' actions shall be unavailable to 
any subject that obtains access to an object that 
has been released back to the system.

3.6	Security Management 

The management of security attributes and configuration 
parameters is an important aspect of a secure product. 
Mechanisms have to be provided to easily maintain the product, 
and they must be protected so that only system administrators 
can manage the security aspects of the product. 

For the CS2 level, SM-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. This level was refined from the Federal Criteria by 
specifying that sessions be terminated rather than locked. An 
assignment was made for the definition and maintenance of 
groups as a security policy attribute. 

 SM-2 Basic Security Management

1. 	The TCB shall provide an installation mechanism 
for the setting and updating of its configuration 
parameters, and for the initialization of its 
protection-relevant data structures before any 
user or administrator policy attributes are 
defined. It shall allow the configuration of TCB 
internal databases and tables.

The TCB shall distinguish between normal mode of 
operation and maintenance mode, and shall provide 
a maintenance-mode mechanism for recovery and 
system start-up.

2. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
displaying and modifying the security policy 
parameters. These parameters shall include 
identification, authentication, system entry and 
access control parameters for the entire system 
and for individual users.

The TCB shall have a capability to define the 
identification and authentication policy on a 
system-wide basis (e.g., password minimum and 
maximum lifetime, password length and complexity 
parameters). The TCB mechanisms shall have the 
capability to limit: (1) maximum period of 
interactive session inactivity, (2) maximum login 
or session time, and (3) successive unsuccessful 
attempts to log in to the system. In particular, 
the TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
specify that sessions be terminated rather than 
locked after a period of inactivity. The control 
of these mechanisms shall be limited to system 
administrators. 

3.						 The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
manually displaying, modifying, or deleting user 
registration and account parameters. These 
parameters shall include unique user identifiers, 
their account, and their associated user name and 
affiliation. The TCB shall allow the manual 
enabling and disabling of user identities and/or 
accounts. 

The TCB shall provide a means to uniquely identify 
security policy attributes. It shall also provide 
a means of listing all these attributes for a 
user, and all the users associated with an 
attribute. It shall be capable of defining and 
maintaining the security policy attributes for 
subjects including: defining and maintaining 
privileges for privileged subjects, discretionary 
(i.e., definition and maintenance of groups) and 
non-discretionary attributes and centralized 
distribution, review and revocation of policy 
attributes. 

4. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
routine control and maintenance of system 
resources. It shall allow the enabling and 
disabling of peripheral devices, mounting of 
removable storage media, backing-up and recovering 
user objects; maintaining the TCB hardware and 
software elements (e.g., on site testing); and 
starting and shutting down the system.

5. 	 The use of the protected mechanisms for system 
administration shall be limited to authorized 
administrative users. The control of access-
control attributes shall be limited to the object 
owner and to system administrators. 

3.7	Reference Mediation 

Reference mediation, that is, the control by the TCB of 
subject accesses to objects, must be ensured so that the users 
can have faith in the TCB's access control decisions. Also, 
users must be ensured that all access to security services are 
mediated by the TCB. 

For the CS2 level, RM-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 RM-1 Mediation of References to a Defined Subject/Object 
Subset

1. 	The TCB shall mediate all references to 
subjects, objects, resources, and services (e.g., 
TCB functions) described in the TCB 
specifications. The mediation shall ensure that 
all references are directed to the appropriate 
security-policy functions.

2.	Reference mediation shall include references to 
the defined subset of subjects, objects, and 
resources protected under the TCB security policy, 
and to their policy attributes (e.g., access 
rights, security and/or integrity levels, role 
identifiers).

3. 	References issued by privileged subjects shall 
be mediated in accordance with the policy 
attributes defined for those subjects.

3.8	Logical TCB Protection 

TCB protection is a fundamental requirement for a secure 
product. All of the security components and mechanisms that 
have been described depend upon the integrity of the TCB and 
on the TCB being isolated and non-circumventable. The TCB must 
be resistant to outside penetration. 

For the CS2 level, P-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 P-1 Basic TCB Isolation

The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own 
execution that protects it from external 
interference and tampering (e.g., by reading or 
modification of its code and data structures). The 
protection of the TCB shall provide TCB isolation 
and noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions as follows:

	1. TCB Isolation requires that (1) the address 
spaces of the TCB and those of unprivileged 
subjects are separated such that users, or 
unprivileged subjects operating on their behalf, 
cannot read or modify TCB data structures or code, 
(2) the transfers between TCB and non-TCB domains 
are controlled such that arbitrary entry to or 
return from the TCB are not possible; and (3) the 
user or application parameters passed to the TCB 
by addresses are validated with respect to the TCB 
address space, and those passed by value are 
validated with respect to the values expected by 
the TCB.

	2. Noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions requires that the permission to objects 
(and/or to non-TCB data) passed as parameters to 
the TCB are validated with respect to the 
permissions required by the TCB, and references to 
TCB objects implementing TCB isolation functions 
are mediated by the TCB.

3.9	TCB Self-Checking 

Validating the correct operation of the TCB firmware and 
hardware is an important aspect of guaranteeing the integrity 
of the product. Hardware and software features that validate 
the correct operation of the product will be delivered with 
the product to ensure that the hardware and firmware are 
installed properly and are in working order.

For the CS2 level, SC-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria.The Federal Criteria was refined to limit the 
execution of operator-controlled tests to system 
administrators.

 SC-2 Basic Self Checking

Hardware and/or software features shall be 
provided that can be used to periodically validate 
the correct operation of the on-site hardware and 
firmware elements of the TCB. These features shall 
include: power-on tests, loadable tests, and 
operator-controlled tests. 

The power-on tests shall test all basic components 
of the TCB hardware and firmware elements 
including memory boards and memory 
interconnections; data paths; busses; control 
logic and processor registers; disk adapters; 
communication ports; system consoles, and the 
keyboard speaker. These tests shall cover all 
components that are necessary to run the loadable 
tests and the operator-controlled tests.

The loadable tests shall cover: processor 
components (e.g., arithmetic and logic unit, 
floating point unit, instruction decode buffers, 
interrupt controllers, register transfer bus, 
address translation buffer, cache, and processor-
to-memory bus controller); backplane busses; 
memory controllers; and writable control memory 
for operator-controlled and remote system-
integrity testing.

Operator-controlled tests shall be able to 
initiate a series of one-time or repeated tests, 
to log the results of these tests and, if any fault 
is detected, to direct the integrity-test programs 
to identify and isolate the failure. The execution 
of operator-controlled tests shall be limited to 
system administrators. 

3.10	TCB Initialization and Recovery 

The recovery and start-up of the TCB must be ensured so that 
the product always remains in a secure state, whether the 
recovery is performed manually or automatically. 

For the CS2 level, TR-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No further refinements were made from the Federal 
Criteria.

 TR-2 Basic for Recovery or Start-up

1. Procedures and/or mechanisms shall be provided 
to assure that, after a TCB failure or other 
discontinuity, recovery without protection 
compromise is obtained.

2. If automated recovery and start-up is not 
possible, the TCB shall enter a state where the 
only system access method is via administrative 
interfaces, terminals, or procedures. 
Administrative procedures shall exist to restore 
the system to a secure state (i.e., a state in 
which all the security-policy properties hold).

3.11	Privileged Operation 

Privileges are associated with functional components so 
that at any given time only those operations that are 
associated with the privilege can be performed. The privileges 
that a product needs must be identified and must cover all the 
security aspects of the product, including the secure 
administration of the product, and should be defined so that 
there is not a single privileged mode for all of the TCB's 
operations. 

For the CS2 level, PO-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 PO-1 Privilege Association with TCB Modules

1. TCB privileges needed by individual functions, 
or groups of functions, shall be identified. 
Privileged TCB calls or access to privileged TCB 
objects, such as user and group registration 
files, password files, security and integrity-
level definition file, role definition file, or 
audit-log file shall also be identified.

2. The identified privileged functions of a TCB 
functional component shall be associated only with 
the privileges necessary to complete their task.

3.12	Ease-of-TCB-Use 

If security mechanisms are not easy to use and maintain, 
then administrative and non-system administrators may be 
tempted to disable the security mechanisms. Therefore, ease 
of use becomes an important element in the administration of 
a secure product and in the creation of privileged 
applications. It also minimizes errors on the part of both the 
administrative and non-system administrators, and can serve 
to minimize the consequences of these errors. 

For the CS2 level, EU-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

EU-2 Ease of Application Programming

1. The TCB shall provide well-defined actions to 
undertake administrative functions. Default 
options shall be provided for security parameters 
of administrative functions.

The TCB shall include fail-safe defaults for the 
policy attributes of the defined subjects and 
objects, as well as user-setable defaults for the 
defined subjects and objects.

2. The TCB shall provide well-defined application 
programming interfaces and programming functions 
(e.g., libraries) for all its policies to support 
the development of applications that can define 
and enforce security policies on application-
controlled subjects and objects. The TCB shall 
enable user-controlled reduction of access rights 
available to applications.


CS2 Assurance 

4.	Introduction

This chapter provides the CS2 development and evaluation 
assurance requirements package using the development and 
evaluation assurance components defined in Volume I and the 
package contained in Volume I, Appendix G of the Federal 
Criteria. The structure of each assurance package follows that 
of the assurance components (i.e., each package consists of 
development process, operational support, development 
environment, development evidence, and evaluation process 
components).

Assurance Package T2+

Assurance package T2+ was chosen for CS2. This package is 
indicated as being TS2+ since an additional component was 
included for flaw remediation and a higher level was chosen 
for trusted generation. This basic assurance level is intended 
to include most commercial computer products that are designed 
to satisfy functional requirements. Although most development 
assurance components are required at their lowest levels, the 
requirements of several product-development components are 
extended to capture (1) specific TCB properties, and (2) a 
rudimentary notion of support for product structure. The 
operational support component is also extended to enable 
systematic flaw discovery, tracking, and repair.

The intent of the product development assurance for this 
package is to establish that the external behavior of the 
product conforms to its user level and administrative 
documentation without analysis of the internal structure of 
the product TCB. For this reason, only the claimed TCB 
protection properties and their informal models, TCB 
interface description, and TCB element list are required to 
enable functional testing. Support for TCB structuring is 
limited to process isolation and separation of the protection 
critical TCB elements from the protection non-critical ones. 

The intent of the operational support assurance for this 
package is to establish a minimal level of user and 
administrative guidance and product information that enables 
the correct product installation and use of product security 
features. Similarly, the development environment assurances 
are intended to provide the a minimal level of control over 
the product configuration and production. This level of 
development environment assurance is similar to that already 
present in most established commercial development 
organizations.

The development evidence required for this package is 
commensurate with the assurances required. The intent of this 
package is to require the type of assurance evidence that is 
generated during the normal commercial development process. 

The intent of evaluation support assurance is to establish 
that the product, and the context in which it is developed and 
supported, is commensurate with the development assurance 
requirements. At the T2+ level, testing analysis and the 
requirement for independent testing determines whether the 
product meets the functional protection requirements. 
Operational support evaluation assurance determines whether 
the product documentation correctly describes the security 
relevant operations. 

Also for CS2, flaw remediation was included in this 
package. Flaw remediation is important for commercial 
environments since it ensures that flaws (i.e, deficiencies 
in a product that enables a user external to the TCB to violate 
the functional requirements of a protection profile) that are 
discovered by the product consumers will be tracked, 
corrected, and disseminated to the affected customers.

The following table  summarizes the generic assurance 
components that comprise the Basic Development Assurance 
Package (T2+).

4.1	TCB Property Definition

The definition of TCB properties assures the consistency of 
the TCB's behavior. It determines a baseline set of properties 
that can be used by system developers and evaluators to assure 
that the TCB satisfies the defined functional requirements.

For CS2, PD-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

PD-2 Informal Property Identification

The developer shall provide informal models for 
the functional components and sub-components of 
the profile. At a minimum, an informal model of 
the access control components shall be provided. 
Each informal model shall include (abstract) data 
structures and operations defining each functional 
component or sub-component, and a description of 
the model properties. The developer shall 
interpret (e.g., trace) the informal models within 
the product TCB. For each model entity, the 
developer shall: (1) identify the TCB elements and 
their TCB interfaces (if any) that implement that 
entity; (2) define the operation of these TCB 
elements, and (3) explain why the operation of 
these elements is consistent with the model 
properties. The developer's interpretation of each 
informal model, which defines the TCB properties, 
shall identify all TCB elements that do not 
correspond to any model entity and shall explain 
why these elements do not render the TCB 
properties invalid.

For the components that are not informally 
modeled, the developer shall interpret the 
functional requirements of the protection profile 
within the product TCB. For each functional 
requirement, the developer shall: (1) identify the 
TCB elements and their TCB interfaces (if any) 
that implement that requirement; (2) describe the 
operation of these TCB elements, and (3) explain 
why the operation of these elements is consistent 
with the functional requirement. The developer's 
interpretation of each functional requirement, 
which describes the TCB properties, shall identify 
all TCB elements that do not correspond to any 
functional requirement and shall explain why these 
elements do not render the TCB properties invalid.

4.2	TCB Element Identification

The identification of TCB elements (hardware, firmware, 
software, code, and data structures) provides the set of 
elements that determine the protection characteristics of a 
product. All assurance methods rely on the correct 
identification of TCB elements either directly or indirectly.

For CS2, ID-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 ID-1: TCB Element Identification

The developer shall identify the TCB elements 
(i.e., software, hardware/firmware code and data 
structures). Each element must be unambiguously 
identified by its name, type, release, and version 
number (if any).

4.3	TCB Interface Definition

The TCB interface establishes the boundary between the TCB 
and its external users and application programs. It consists 
of several components, such as command interfaces (i.e., user 
oriented devices such as the keyboard and mouse), application 
program interfaces (system calls), and machine/processor 
interfaces (processor instructions).

For CS2, IF-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

IF-1: Interface Description

The developer shall describe all external (e.g., 
command, software, and I/O) administrative (i.e., 
privileged) and non-administrative interfaces to 
the TCB. The description shall include those 
components of the TCB that are implemented as 
hardware and/or firmware if their properties are 
visible at the TCB interface.

The developer shall identify all call conventions 
(e.g., parameter order, call sequence 
requirements) and exceptions signaled at the TCB 
interface.

4.4	TCB Structuring Support

Structuring the TCB into modules is necessary. However, the 
modular decomposition does not necessarily reflect the run-
time enforcement of the TCB structuring since the separation 
of modules may not necessarily be supported by run-time 
mechanisms. The run-time enforcement of internal TCB 
structuring adds a measure of assurance that the TCB elements 
that are critical to the enforcement of the protection 
functions are separate from the non-critical elements. Also, 
the use of run-time enforcement of TCB structuring helps 
separate protection-critical TCB elements from each other, 
thereby helping to enforce the separation of protection 
concerns and minimizing the common mechanisms shared between 
protection critical elements.

For CS3, SP-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 SP-1: Process Isolation

The TCB shall maintain process isolation.

4.5	Developer Functional Testing

Functional testing establishes that the TCB interface 
exhibits the properties necessary to satisfy the requirements 
of the protection profile. It provides assurance that the TCB 
satisfies at least its functional protection requirements.

For CS2, FT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 FT-1: Conformance Testing

The developer shall test the TCB interface to show 
that all claimed protection functions work as 
stated in the TCB interface description.

The developer shall correct all flaws discovered 
by testing and shall retest the TCB until the 
protection functions are shown to work as claimed.

4.6	User's Guidance

User's guidance is an operational support assurance 
component that ensures that usage constraints assumed by the 
protection profile are understood by the users of the product. 
It is the primary means available for providing product users 
with the necessary background and specific information on how 
to correctly use the product's protection functionality.

For CS2, UG-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 UG-1: Users' Guide

The developer shall provide a Users' Guide which 
describes all protection services provided and 
enforced by the TCB. The User's Guide shall 
describe the interaction between these services 
and provide examples of their use. The User's 
Guide may be in the form of a summary, chapter or 
manual. The User's Guide shall specifically 
describe user responsibilities. These shall 
encompass any user responsibilities identified in 
the protection profile.

4.7	Administrative Guidance

Administrative guidance is an operation support assurance 
component that ensures that the environmental constraints 
assumed by the protection profile are understood by 
administrative users and operators of the IT product. It is 
the primary means available to the developer for providing to 
administrators and operators detailed, accurate information 
on how to configure and install the product, operate the IT 
product is a secure manner, make effective use of the 
product's privileges and protection mechanisms to control 
access to administrative functions and data bases, and to 
avoid pitfalls and improper use of the administrative 
functions that would compromise the TCB and user security.

For CS2, AG-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 AG-1: Basic Administrative Guidance

The developer shall provide a Trusted Facility 
Manual intended for the product administrators 
that describes how to use the TCB security 
services (e.g., Access Control, System Entry, or 
Audit) to enforce a system security policy. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall include the 
procedures for securely configuring, starting, 
maintaining, and halting the TCB. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall explain how to analyze audit 
data generated by the TCB to identify and document 
user and administrator violations of this policy. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain the 
privileges and functions of administrators. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall describe the 
administrative interaction between security 
services.

The Trusted Facility Manual shall be distinct from 
User Guidance, and encompass any administrative 
responsibilities identified in security 
management.

4.8	Flaw Remediation Procedures

Flaw remediation is an operational support assurance 
component that ensures that flaws (i.e, deficiencies in a 
product that enables a user external to the TCB to violate the 
functional requirements of a protection profile) that are 
discovered by the product consumers will be tracked, 
corrected, and disseminated to the affected customers.

For CS2, FR-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 FR-1: Basic Flaw Remediation

Flaw Tracking Procedures: The developer shall 
establish a procedure to track all reported 
protection flaws in each release of the product. 
The tracking system shall include a description of 
the nature and effect of each flaw and the status 
of finding a correction to the flaw.

Flaw Repair Procedures: The developer shall 
establish a procedure to identify corrective 
actions for protection flaws.

Customer Interaction Procedures: The developer 
shall provide flaw information and corrections to 
registered customers.

4.9	Trusted Generation

Trusted generation is an operational support assurance 
component that ensures that the copy of the product's TCB that 
is configured and activated by the consumer exhibits the same 
protection properties as the master copy of the product's TCB 
that was evaluated for compliance with the protection profile. 
The trusted generation procedures must provide some 
confidence that the consumer will be aware of what product 
configuration parameters can affect the protection properties 
of the TCB. The procedures must encourage the consumer to 
choose parameter settings that are within the bounds assumed 
during the product evaluation.

For CS2, TG-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

TG-2: Trusted Generation With Fail-Safe Defaults

The developer shall establish and document the 
procedures that a customer must perform to 
generate an operational TCB from the delivered 
copy of the master TCB. The customer documentation 
shall identify any system parameters, which are 
initialized or set during system generation, that 
affect the TCB's conformance to the protection 
profile and state the acceptable ranges of values 
for those parameters. The product shall be 
delivered with each of these parameters set to its 
fail-safe defaults.

4.10	Evidence of TCB Protection Properties

The documentation of the TCB protection properties includes 
the definition of the functional component requirements, 
their modeling (if any), and their interpretation within a 
product's TCB. For each requirement of a protection profile, 
a description, definition (an informal, descriptive 
specification), or a formal specification of the TCB 
components and their operation corresponding to the 
requirement must be provided.

For CS2, EPP-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPP-1 Evidence of TCB Correspondence to the Functional 
Requirements

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. The TCB properties, which 
are defined by this correspondence, shall be 
explained in this documentation.

4.11	Evidence of Product Development

Product development evidence consists of the TCB design 
evidence including the documentation of the TCB interface, TCB 
elements, TCB structure, TCB structuring support, and TCB 
design disciplines. The TCB implementation evidence includes 
TCB source code, and the processor hardware and firmware 
specifications.

For CS2, EPD-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPD-2: Description Of The TCB External Interface

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. The developer shall also 
provide an informal access control model and its 
interpretation within the TCB. The TCB properties, 
which are defined by this correspondence, shall be 
explained in this documentation.

4.12	Evidence of Functional Testing

Functional testing evidence includes the testing itself, 
the test plans, and test documentation results. Test plans 
consist of: the description definition or specification of the 
test conditions; the test data, which consists of the test 
environment set-up; the test parameters and expected 
outcomes; and a description of the test coverage. 

For CS2, EFT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EFT-1: Evidence of Conformance Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of the 
functional testing that includes the test plan, 
the test procedures and the results of the 
functional testing.

4.13	Evidence of Product Support

Product support evidence consists of the development 
environment and operational support documentation and tools. 
The development environment evidence includes the 
documentation of the product life-cycle process, 
configuration management procedures enforced, and the trusted 
distribution mechanisms and procedures used. It also 
includes: the identification of the tools used in the product 
development, configuration management, and trusted 
distribution; and the characteristics that make those tools 
suitable for the development of product protection.

For CS2, EPS-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPS-1: Evidence of Basic Product Support

The developer shall provide evidence that 
describes the policies, procedures, and plans 
established by the developer to satisfy the 
Operational Support and Development Environment 
requirements of the protection profile. 

4.14	Test Analysis

Test analysis determines whether the product meets the 
functional protection requirements defined in the protection 
profile. Functional testing is based on operational product, 
the TCB's functional properties, the product's operational 
support guidance, and other producer's documentation as 
defined by the development evidence requirements. Functional 
test analysis is based on the achieved test results as 
compared to the expected results derived from the development 
evidence.

For CS2, TA-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 TA-1: Elementary Test Analysis

The evaluator shall assess whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for functional testing and 
whether the producer has documented these 
activities as defined in the development evidence 
requirements of the protection profile. The 
evaluator shall analyze the results of the 
producer's testing activities for completeness of 
coverage and consistency of results. The evaluator 
shall determine whether the product's protection 
properties, as described in the product 
documentation have been tested. The evaluator 
shall assess testing results to determine whether 
the product's TCB works as claimed.

4.15	Independent Testing 

Independent testing determines whether the product's TCB 
meets the functional protection requirements as defined in the 
functionality chapter of this Protection Profile. Testing is 
based on the operational product, the TCB's functional 
properties, the product's operational support guidance, and 
other producer's documentation as defined by the Development 
Evidence requirements.

For CS2, IT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 IT-1: Elementary Independent Testing

A tester, independent of the producer or 
evaluator, shall perform functional and elementary 
penetration testing. This testing shall be based 
on the product's user and administrative 
documentation, and on relevant known penetration 
flaws. Satisfactory completion consists of 
demonstrating that all user-visible security 
enforcing functions and security-relevant 
functions work as described in the product's user 
and administrative documentation and that no 
discrepancies exist between the documentation and 
the product. Test results of the producer shall be 
confirmed by the results of independent testing. 
The evaluator may selectively reconfirm any test 
result.

If the independent testing is performed at beta-
test sites, the producer shall supply the beta-
test plan and the test results. The evaluator 
shall review the scope and depth of beta testing 
with respect to the required protection 
functionality, and shall verify independence of 
both the test sites and the producer's and beta-
test user's test results. The evaluator shall 
confirm that the test environment of the beta-test 
site(s) adequately represents the environment 
specified in the protection profile.

4.16	Operational Support Review

Operation support review establishes the level of review 
required to determine whether the product meets the 
requirements as defined in the protection profile's 
Development Assurance subsections for Operational Support 
including, at the CS2 level, the User and Administrative 
Guidance documents.

For CS2, OSR-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 OSR-1 Elementary Operational Support Review

The evaluator shall review all documentation 
focused on the activities of product use (e.g., 
Users Manuals) and product administration 
including installation, operation, maintenance, 
and trusted recovery (e.g., Trusted Facility 
Management Manuals). This review shall assess the 
clarity of presentation, difficulty in locating 
topics of interest, ease of understanding, and 
completeness of coverage. The need for separate 
manuals dedicated to protection-relevant aspects 
of the product should be assessed for 
effectiveness.

COMMERCIAL SECURITY 3 (CS3)

CS3 compliant products provide enhanced protection 
beyond those of the CS1 and CS2 Protection Profiles 
by providing administrative and access control 
features to centrally control access to information 
and other resources based on roles. Through the use 
of role based access controls, a variety of 
organization specific non-discretionary integrity 
and confidentiality policies can be specified and 
enforced. In addition, CS3 provides stronger 
authentication measures, more administrative tools, 
and requires a greater degree of assurance 
evidence.

CS3 Rationale

2.17	Introduction

As outlined in the Federal Criteria, this rationale 
describes the protection philosophy, how the security 
features are intended to be used, the assumptions about the 
environment in which a compliant product is intended to 
operate, the threats within that environment, and the security 
features and assurances that counter these threats. At the CS3 
level, the features used to counter threats and the strength 
of the assurance evidence is enhanced over CS1 and CS2 and is 
indicated in the text through bold italics.

2.17.1	Protection Philosophy

Any discussion of protection necessarily starts from a 
protection philosophy, i.e., what it really means to call the 
product "secure." In general, products will control access to 
information and other resources through the use of specific 
security features so that only properly authorized 
individuals or processes acting on their behalf will be 
granted access. For CS1, four fundamental requirements are 
derived for this statement of protection:

o	Access authorization

o	Accountability

o	Assurance 

o	Availability of Service

The totality of the functionality that enforces the access 
authorization and accountability protection philosophy is 
comprised of the hardware, software, and firmware of the 
Trusted Computing Base (TCB). CS3 requires the TCB to be self-
protecting and resistant to bypass so that it is effective at 
countering identified threats. CS3 also requires effective 
management of security attributes and configuration 
parameters. The assurance protection philosophy is comprised 
of the development process, operational support, development 
environment, development evidence, and evaluation process 
assurances. Each of these are explained below.

2.17.1.1	Access Authorization

The access authorization portion of the philosophy of 
protection for this profile addresses subject and object 
access mediation. For CS3 compliant products, access 
authorization has been further refined to include system 
entry, subject and object mediation based on system entry, 
subject and object mediation based on role identifiers, and 
privileged operations.

2.17.1.1.1	System Entry

CS3 provides the capability for an system administrator to 
establish, maintain, and protect information from 
unauthorized access, and defines the identities of and 
conditions under which users may gain entry into the system. 
These system entry controls are based on user identification, 
role membership, time, location, and method of entry. CS3 
strengthens the requirement for locking interactive sessions 
by requiring the display device to be cleared or overwritten 
to make the current contents of the screen unreadable.

2.17.1.1.2	Subject and Object Access Mediation

CS1 and CS2 provide protected access to resources and 
objects. CS3 compliant products also provide the capability 
of specifying and enforcing access control decisions based on 
roles [12][13]. In many organizations, the end users do not 
"own" the information and the programs for which they are 
allowed access. For these organizations, the corporation or 
agency is the actual "owner" of the system objects as well as 
the programs that process them. Control is often based on 
employee functions rather than on ownership.

Access control decisions are often determined by the roles 
individual users take on as part of an organization. The 
definition of a role includes the specification of duties, 
responsibilities, and qualifications. For example, the roles 
an individual associated with a hospital can assume include 
doctor, nurse, clinician, and pharmacist. Roles in a bank 
include teller, loan officer, and accountant. Roles can also 
apply to military systems; for example, target analyst, 
situation analyst, and traffic analyst are common roles in 
tactical systems. A Role Based Access Control (RBAC) policy 
bases access control decisions on the functions a user is 
allowed to perform within an organization. Under this policy, 
the users cannot pass access permissions to other users at 
their discretion.

For each role, a set of transactions associated with the 
role is maintained. A transaction can be thought of as a 
transformation procedure [12] (a program or a portion of a 
program) plus a set of associated data items. In addition, 
each role has an associated set of individual members. 

The determination of membership and the allocation of 
transactions to a role is in compliance with organization 
specific non-discretionary policies. These policies can be 
derived from existing laws, ethics, regulations, or generally 
accepted practices. These policies are non-discretionary in 
the sense that they are unavoidably imposed on all users. 

For subject and object access mediation, CS3 also provides 
for additional time and location access control attributes. 
At a minimum, these attributes include the user's port of 
entry.

2.17.1.1.3	Privileges

CS3 supports and promotes the separation and use of 
privileges for TCB modules. A privilege enables a subject to 
perform a security relevant operation that, by default, is 
denied. Privileges cover all security aspects of a product, 
including TCB operations performed by system administrators. 
CS3 compliant products have tightly controlled privilege 
definitions as well as control over subjects that hold 
privileges. 

2.17.1.2	Accountability

The accountability portion of the philosophy of protection 
for this profile addresses user identification and 
authentication (I&A), requirements for security auditing, and 
a Trusted Path between a user and the operating system. Each 
of these are explained below.

2.17.1.2.1	Identification and Authentication

User identification is required to support access control 
and security auditing. This includes the capability to 
establish, maintain, and protect a unique identifier for each 
authorized user. User identification is functionally 
dependent on authentication. Authentication is a method of 
validating a person as a legitimate user.

User authentication in most computer systems has been 
provided primarily through the use of passwords. CS2 supports 
a variety of password features that give the product a great 
amount of flexibility in the generation of passwords, in 
password security, password features, and password 
administration. For most products, a great deal of confidence 
is placed on maintaining the privacy of passwords belonging 
to individuals. I&A prevents unauthorized individuals from 
logging into the product, therefore, password management is 
essential to secure product operations. The risk of losing a 
password is addressed within CS2 through promoting the use of 
stringent password management practices.

In addition, CS2 allows for stronger authentication 
approaches. CS2 specifies that a unique identifier be 
associated with each trusted subject such as print spoolers, 
database management system services, and transaction 
processing monitors. It also requires the TCB to maintain, 
protect, and display status information for all active users 
and all enabled or disabled user identities or accounts.

CS3 also provides for stronger authentication mechanisms 
for those commercial and government environments that need 
such assurance, such as law enforcement agencies, nuclear 
facilities, and commercial airports. These other approaches 
can be categorized as "something a user is," which can be 
indicated through the use of a unique characteristic that a 
person possesses, or "something a user has," such as a smart 
card. For example, biometrics is a "something you are" 
approach for identifying individuals through the use of a 
unique physical characteristic associated with a person such 
as a fingerprint or a retina pattern. In many respects, the 
biometrics approach to user identification is a cleaner and 
more secure approach than a password mechanism. This method 
eliminates the concern over the compromise of a password. 
However, while biometric devices are currently available, 
their expense makes them impractical for most applications. 
"Something a user has" requires a physical device that users 
must have in their possession at authentication time. Usually, 
these devices require the user to enter a Personal 
Identification Number (PIN) in case the device is lost or 
stolen.

2.17.1.2.2	Audit

For most secure products, a capability must exist to audit 
the security relevant events. As each user performs security 
relevant tasks, the product must record the user identifier, 
the action performed, and the result in a security log. For 
CS31compliant products, a capability is specified to allow a 
system administrator to access and evaluate audit 
information. This capability provides a method of protection 
in the sense that all security relevant events that occur 
within a computer system can be logged and the responsible 
user held accountable for his/her actions. Audit trails are 
used to detect and deter penetration of a computer system and 
to reveal activity that identifies misuse.

CS3 provides for an effective audit mechanism by supporting 
the following basic security characteristics. It provides the 
ability to:

o	review the use of I&A mechanisms;

o	discover the introduction of objects into a user's 
address space;

o	discover the deletion of objects; 

o	discover actions taken by computer operators and 
system administrators;

o	audit attempts to violate resource allocation limits;

o	protect the audit data so that access to it is limited 
to system administrators that are authorized to 
examine audit information;

o	discover the use of privileges, such as changing the 
ownership of an object;

o	have the audit mechanism act as a deterrent against 
penetrators or hackers; and

o	to use audit reduction tools for assessing the damage 
that may result in the event of a violation of the 
implemented security policy. These tools have the 
capability of selectively reviewing the actions of one 
or more users or roles, actions performed on a 
specific object or system resource, and actions 
associated with specific access control attributes.

2.17.1.3	Availability of Service

CS3 promotes the continuous accessibility and usability of 
resources. The TCB provides the capability to detect and 
recover from discontinuity of service using some combination 
of automatic and procedural techniques. Also, resource 
allocation requirements replace restrictions on the number of 
subjects and objects a user may have allocated at any given 
time. This prevents one individual user from denying access 
to another user's subject and object space.

2.17.1.4	Assurance

Assurance addresses all areas of product development 
assurance and evaluation assurance. The Development assurance 
addresses the development process, operational support, the 
development environment, and the development evidence. 
Development process assurance defines the additional efforts 
that a developer must undertake to satisfy the assurance 
objectives while creating the product. It specifies how the 
TCB should be designed and supported by the implementation as 
well as how it should be tested. Operational support assurance 
defines the documentation of the security features for both 
administrative and non-administrative users as well as 
requirements for TCB flaw remediation and TCB generation. 
Development environment assurance includes requirements for 
defining the product's life cycle and specific features for 
configuration management. Development evidence assurance 
defines the TCB's protection properties, details the 
requirements for product testing and analysis, and defines the 
requirements for product support. Evaluation assurance 
establishes that the product, and the context in which it is 
developed and supported, is commensurate with the development 
assurance requirements.

The T3+ Assurance Package was chosen for CS3. This package 
is indicated as being TS3+ since an additional component was 
included for flaw remediation. This enhanced assurance level 
is intended to include the best of the commercial computer 
products designed to satisfy functional requirements. As 
such, this package includes several extensions to the 
assurance components of the previous two packages. 

The intent of product development assurance for this 
package is both to establish that the external behavior of the 
product conforms to its user level and administrative 
documentation and to provide visibility into the internal 
structure of the product's TCB. For this reason, requirements 
for Descriptive Interface Specifications (DIS) and modular 
decomposition have been added. TCB element identification and 
security functional testing have also been extended and 
penetration testing requirements have been provided to 
support the added assurances of external behavior. 

The intent of the operational support assurance for this 
package is to establish a level of user and administrative 
guidance and product information that enables the correct 
product installation and the use of product security features. 
The developer is required to establish and document a policy 
for responding to customer inquiries and flaw remediation. 
Similarly, the development environment assurances are 
intended to provide a level of control over the product 
configuration and production, including well-defined coding 
standards and strict configuration management processes. This 
level of development environment assurance is similar to that 
used in the most advanced commercial development 
organizations.

The development evidence required for this package is 
commensurate with the assurances required. The intent of this 
package is to require the type of assurance evidence that is 
generated during commercial development oriented towards of 
high-quality products. 

At the T3+ level, evaluation support assurance determines 
whether the product meets the functional requirements for 
testing analysis and for independent testing. Operational 
support evaluation assurance determines whether the product 
documentation correctly describes the security relevant 
operations. Development environment assurance determines 
whether the product meets the requirements as defined in the 
Protection Profile's development assurance subsections. 
Design assurance determines whether the product meets the 
design requirements as defined in the Development Process 
Assurance section of this Protection Profile.

Also for CS3, flaw remediation was included in this 
package. Flaw remediation is important for commercial 
environments since it ensures that flaws (i.e, deficiencies 
in a product that enables a user external to the TCB to violate 
the functional requirements of a protection profile) that are 
discovered by the product consumers will be tracked, 
corrected, and disseminated to the affected customers. 
Vendors are required to separate protection-relevant fixes 
from those that are not protection-relevant and must document 
points of contact for customer error reports.

2.17.1.5	Intended Method of Use

All individual users (both administrative and non-
administrative users) are assigned a unique user identifier. 
This user identifier supports individual accountability. The 
operating system authenticates the claimed identity of the 
user before allowing the user to perform any further actions. 
Upon successful authentication, users are restricted to 
accessing programs, transactions, and information in a manner 
that is consistent with their assigned role(s). 

Products that comply with the CS3 Protection Profile are 
provided with the capability of assigning privileges to TCB 
modules. These privileges are used to control access to user 
and role registration files, password files, and audit trails. 
Privileges are associated with functional components so that 
only the privileges necessary to complete a security relevant 
task can be assigned at a given time. Also, privileges are 
associated with TCB operations performed by system 
administrators. This capability is particularly important to 
prevent a "privileged user" or "superuser" from having a wide 
set of privileges when only a subset is needed.

In addition, CS3 provides administrative and access control 
capabilities that allow for the central administration of a 
non-discretionary access control policy based on roles. A role 
specifies a user's set of transactions that allow the user to 
access resources through specific functions. Transactions can 
only be allocated to roles by system administrators. 
Membership to a role can only be granted and revoked by system 
administrators.

Products that comply with CS3 specifications are intended 
to be used within the following operational constraints:

o	The information system is designed to be administered 
as a unique entity by a single organization.

o	The information system is designed to manage 
computing, storage, input/output, and to control the 
sharing of resources among multiple users and computer 
processes.

o	The administrative and non-administrative users are 
identified as distinct individuals.

o	For role based access control, administrators are 
responsible for interpreting and enforcing 
organizational policies and protection guidelines 
that are derived from existing laws, ethics, 
regulations, or generally accepted practices.

o	The information system provides facilities for real-
time interaction with users that have access to input/
output devices.

o	System administrators are selectively assigned 
privileges that are minimally necessary to perform 
their security related task.

2.17.2	Environmental Assumptions

A product designed to meet the CS3 Protection Profile is 
intended to be a general purpose, multi-user operating system 
that runs on either a workstation, minicomputer, or mainframe. 
CS3 compliant products are expected to be used for both 
commercial and government environments. The information being 
processed for both commercial and government environments may 
be unclassified, sensitive-but-unclassified, or single-level 
classified, but not multi-level classified information.

The following specific environmental conditions have been 
assumed in specifying CS3:

o	The product hardware base (e.g., CPU, printers, 
terminals, etc.), firmware, and software will be 
protected from unauthorized physical access.

o	There will be one or more personnel assigned to manage 
the product including the security of the information 
it contains.

o	The operational environment will be managed according 
to the operational environment documentation that is 
required in the assurance chapter of the Protection 
Profile.

o	Access control to information and other resources is 
determined by the roles that individual users have.

o	The IT product provides a cooperative environment for 
users to accomplish some task or group of tasks.

o	The processing resources of the IT product, including 
all terminals, are assumed to be located within user 
spaces that have physical access controls established.

o	The IT product provides facilities for some or all of 
the authorized users to create programs that use an 
Application Programming Interface (API) to enable them 
to protect themselves and their objects from 
unauthorized use.

o	Fail-safe defaults are included for the access control 
attributes for the defined subjects and objects for 
the product.

2.17.3	Expected Threats

In general, the choice of which Protection Profile to 
choose depends upon the level of security that is required for 
that particular organizational environment. The lowest level, 
the CS1 level, is intended for those commercial and government 
environments where all the system personnel are trusted and 
all the data on the system is at the same classification 
level. For example, a government agency where all personnel 
has a government clearance, all data is unclassified, and 
there is no outside network connections would be an ideal 
candidate for CS1, i.e., the threats to be countered are such 
that only a minimal level of trust is needed. However, most 
commercial and government environments are more complex and 
require a higher degree of trust. CS2 addresses the security 
needs for the mainstream commercial and government 
environments. It provides a higher level of trust for those 
organizations that need to enforce a security policy where 
there is no need for different classifications of data. CS3 
is intended to provide the highest level of trust for 
commercial and government environments. It is intended to be 
used in those environments where a great deal of trust is 
required, such as in law enforcement agencies, nuclear 
facilities, or commercial airports. It provides the strongest 
features, mechanisms, and assurances to counter these 
threats.

A product that is designed to meet the CS3 Protection 
Profile and operate within its assumed environment will 
provide capabilities to counter these threats. It should be 
noted, however, that although a product may faithfully 
implement all the features and assurances specified in this 
Protection Profile, the complete elimination of any one threat 
should not be assumed. A product that is designed to meet the 
CS3 Protection Profile is generally known to be more effective 
at countering the threats than products that meet the CS1 and 
CS2 Protection Profiles. CS3 products counter all the CS1 and 
CS2 threats, and contain stronger features and more assurance 
evidence than CS1 and CS2 products. In addition to countering 
CS1 and CS2 threats, CS3 compliant products provide protection 
capabilities to counter one additional threat as follows:

1.	AN UNAUTHORIZED USER MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE 
SYSTEM

For CS1 compliant products, the threat of an unauthorized 
user gaining access to the system is primarily addressed by 
I&A features that allow the TCB to verify the identity of 
individuals attempting to gain access to the system. This is 
accomplished through the use of passwords.

Although not a direct countermeasure, auditing requirements 
are specified at the CS1 level to provide the capability to 
perform an after-the-fact analysis of unauthorized system 
entry and login attempts. This provides an opportunity for the 
system administrators to take corrective actions, such as 
strengthening existing user authentication methods or 
requiring users to change their passwords.

For CS2 compliant systems, the threat of an unauthorized 
user gaining access to the system is primarily addressed by 
stronger I&A features and system entry requirements. 

CS2 specifies password requirements that promote a strong 
organizational password management program. These 
requirements specify that: null passwords cannot be used 
during normal operations; passwords be stored in a one-way 
encrypted form; the clear text representation of a password 
be automatically suppressed; passwords have a minimum-length; 
and that the system utilize a password complexity-checking 
algorithm. An advisory capability is also provided to exclude 
a list of customer-specified passwords. Such requirements 
support the use of passwords that are effective against 
password guessing. To further reduce the probability of a 
password being guessed, requirements limit the number of 
attempted login attempts that can be made by a user associated 
with a specific user identifier. The probability of a single 
password being guessed is further reduced by requirements for 
password aging, by having limitations on password reuse, and 
by allowing users to choose a password that is already 
associated with another user identifier. 

CS2 also allows for a password generating capability. 
Because random passwords can be difficult to remember and 
users are tempted to write them down, requirements are 
specified for the generation of passwords that are easy to 
remember (i.e., pronounceable). Additionally, an advisory 
requirement is specified to allow users to choose from a list 
of alternative passwords.

To minimize the threat that a password has been 
compromised, a requirement exists to allow a user to change 
the password. Because a password can be compromised by 
observing the characters on a terminal screen as it is being 
typed, there is a requirement to blot out the clear-text 
representation of the password on the display device.

In addition, requirements are specified to display an 
advisory warning message to all users prior to system logon 
to discourage a would-be system penetrator from attempting an 
unauthorized system entry. Such a message can also provide a 
basis for subsequent prosecution. System entry requirements 
also specify additional controls on identified and 
authenticated users entering the system. Once a user is 
authenticated, a check is made to determine if the user is 
allowed further entry. System entry is granted only in 
accordance with the authenticated user's access control 
attributes. These conditions are in terms of a user's identity 
and his/her membership in roles. In addition, CS2 specifies 
system entry requirements to display to an authorized user, 
upon successful system entry, the date and time, method of 
access or port of entry, and the number of failed logon 
attempts since the last successful system entry by that user 
identifier. These requirements provide a user with the 
capability to detect attempted or successful system 
penetrations. In addition, requirements are specified to lock 
and terminate an interactive session after an administrator-
specified period of user inactivity, and also for the TCB to 
appear to perform the entire user authentication procedure 
even if the user identification entered is invalid. The TCB 
also provides a protected mechanism to allow or deny system 
entry based on specified ranges of time. Also, conditions for 
system entry via dial-up lines are required to be specified.

I&A requirements are also enhanced over those of CS1 by 
specifying requirements for the identification for each 
trusted user, and by specifying requirements for system 
administrators to disable a user's identity or account when 
the number of unsuccessful logon attempts exceeds an 
administrator specified threshold. This is intended to 
mitigate the effectiveness of successive attacks of system 
penetration. 

Although passwords are currently the most common method for 
authenticating users, CS3 supports the inclusion of a variety 
of additional authentication mechanisms, such as smart-cards, 
cryptographic-based authentication, and biometrics. Also, 
access control attributes have been enhanced to include time 
and location capabilities. This allows an organization to 
acquire and integrate stronger user authentication 
capabilities when penetration threats warrant such 
capabilities.

 Also, during system entry, users are granted entry based 
on their role. In addition, CS3 extends the system entry 
requirements of CS2 by specifying features for user-initiated 
locking of the user's interactive sessions (e.g., keyboard 
locking). 

2.	AN AUTHORIZED USER MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO 
RESOURCES WHEN THE USER IS NOT ALLOWED ACCESS

An authorized user can gain access to unauthorized 
resources by assuming the user identifier of another user and 
thus gaining their associated access rights. This is addressed 
through the use of passwords.

Once an authorized user has gained access to the system, 
the threat still remains for a user to gain access to 
resources when the uer is not authorized. At the resource 
level, CS2 specifies access control features to mediate (i.e., 
distribute, review, and revoke) user access to a subset of 
resources. 

The object reuse feature has been specified to ensure that 
resource contents are cleared before they are reused. This 
reduces the vulnerability that the resource contents can be 
read before it is overwritten. 

To address the vulnerability associated with passwords, CS2 
specifies password requirements that promote a strong 
organizational password management program. Besides those 
password requirements that address penetration threats from 
unauthorized users, other password requirements have been 
specified to counter the threat of an insider (authorized 
user) attack. There are password requirements that specify 
that passwords must always be stored in encrypted format and 
that passwords can never be included in audit trail data. 
Also, in the event that a user selects a password that is 
already in use by another user, requirements disallow the 
system from acknowledging the dual association.

In addition, CS3 specifies access control features to limit 
the roles that may change to another role that provides any 
additional privileges to that user. These controls are based 
on the role identifier. Also, administrators are provided with 
capabilities through the use of protected mechanisms to set 
and control security related parameters, defaults, 
thresholds, attributes, and other security related data. This 
provides the ability to effectively specify and control access 
to resources based on site specific protection policies. 

CS3 also specifies that privileges must be associated with 
TCB modules, TCB calls, and accesses to privileged TCB objects 
(e.g., user and role registration files. password files, audit 
log files), and with TCB operations performed by 
administrative users.

CS2 specifies requirements for a direct communication 
channel, i.e., a trusted path, between the user and the 
operating system to counter spoofing threats. This security 
feature provides confidence that a user at a terminal will 
communicate directly with the TCB rather than to malicious 
code. In particular, to counter the threat of an authorized 
user creating a spoof of legitimate user identifier 
authorization prompts, CS2 specifies requirements for a 
direct communication path between the user and the 
authentication system.

Requirements are also specified to display an advisory 
warning message to all users prior to system logon to 
discourage unauthorized system entry. Such a message can also 
provide a basis for subsequent prosecution.

Once an authorized user has been identified and 
authenticated, system entry control can help counter threats 
of inadvertent, deliberate, and coerced entry performed in an 
unauthorized manner by an authorized user. At the end of 
system entry control, the user bears the access-control 
attributes determined during the I&A process, provided that 
the system entry conditions are satisfied. These conditions 
can be specified in terms of a user's identity, role identity, 
or mode of access.

CS2 also provides other security features. Application 
programming interfaces are provided so that applications can 
protect themselves and their objects from unauthorized use. 
CS2 specifies lists of user identities authorized to enter the 
system via dial-up lines. CS2 also specifies general 
authentication facilities for use by application developers, 
system administrators, and users for the protection of 
resources.

To guard against unauthorized user access, CS3 specifies 
that TCB privileges can be associated with TCB operations 
performed by system administrators. 

Roles are also used as an access control attribute in that 
access to a particular object may be granted or denied based 
on a specific role. CS3 also specifies general authentication 
facilities for use by application developers, system 
administrators, and users for the enhanced protection of 
resources. CS3 specifies requirements to provide users with 
the ability to clear the content of their screens and lock 
their interactive session without having to logoff the system. 
This reduces the likelihood that a user will leave his or her 
terminal while engaged in an active session. Also at the CS3 
level, privileges are associated with TCB operations 
performed by system administrators. To further strengthen TCB 
mediation, CS3 expands the scope of authorization rules to 
include all subject and object contents and all access control 
attributes.

3.	AN AUTHORIZED USER MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO A ROLE 
WHEN THE USER IS NOT ALLOWED ACCESS

This threat is countered by having a protected mechanism in 
the TCB that allows only authorized users to access a 
particular role. Users are prompted for the role they wish to 
assume for that login session during system entry, and entry 
will be denied if the user tries to assume a role for which 
he/she is not authorized. This is assured through security 
functional testing and through penetration testing. Also, 
only system administrators are allowed to set role 
characteristics and to include or delete users from a 
particular role. Attempts to access and use a particular role 
can be audited, and the use and definition of roles are 
explained in security documentation.

4.	SECURITY RELEVANT ACTIONS MAY NOT BE TRACEABLE TO THE 
USER ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVENT

CS3 accountability and audit requirements are specified to 
provide the capability to track security relevant actions 
performed by users and link such actions, if possible, to the 
responsible identifier. Audit mechanisms are responsible for 
the monitoring and detecting of real or potential security 
violations or events. These audit events can include 
successful or unsuccessful: I&A events, the introduction of 
objects into a user's address space, the deletion of objects, 
and actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators. Each audit record includes the date, time, 
location, type of event, identity of the user and object 
involved, and the success or failure of the event. 

Requirements are specified to protect audit trail data and 
the audit control mechanism from unauthorized access, 
modification, or destruction. Audit features are specified to 
provide post-collection audit analysis on specific data 
items, users, and privileged operations. Also, a capability 
is provided for trusted application programs to append data 
to the security audit trail. 

System entry control helps to enhance accountability by 
providing a time, space, and mode-of-entry context to each 
action for which the user is held accountable. These added 
constraints help to give additional assurance that the proper 
user is held responsible for a set of authorized actions.

At the CS2 level, tools are specified to enhance the 
effectiveness of user accountability. CS3 specifies 
requirements to provide tools to verify the consistency of the 
audit trial data and the selection of audit events. Tools are 
also specified for post-collection analysis to selectively 
review various actions. 

Authentication capabilities are extended to provide for 
additional authentication methods, for example, tokens or 
biometrics.

5.	THE PRODUCT MAY BE DELIVERED, INSTALLED, AND THEN USED 
IN AN UNSECURED MANNER

This threat is countered by explicitly requiring that the 
product be delivered with all security features turned on. 
This ensures that the product is secure by default rather than 
insecure by default. This is complemented by allowing many 
security features to be configurable so that, as a specific 
organization gains experience with the actual threats in its 
environment, the organization can adjust the degree of 
security in their system. There are several requirements that 
reinforce the "security by default" perspective during 
initial installation. Requirements for security 
administrative documentation are specified to increase the 
likelihood that the administrator will install and start the 
system in a secure manner.

6.	SECURITY BREACHES MAY OCCUR BECAUSE AVAILABLE SECURITY 
FEATURES ARE NOT USED OR ARE USED IMPROPERLY

Requirements for authentication, system and access control, 
security management, and product documentation provide a 
basis for countering this threat. Authentication requirements 
provide for password management procedures to reduce the 
possibility of easy to guess passwords and to initialize 
passwords for users. Password generation algorithms are 
provided that generate easy to remember passwords and that 
give the user a choice of passwords. In addition, CS3 provides 
for a capability to import and export objects and subjects 
with defined access control attributes. This ensures that 
access control attributes are maintained with the subject or 
object during import and export operations.

Security management requirements are specified for listing, 
setting, and updating all of the system security parameters 
and attributes. These parameters and attributes pertain to 
identification, authentication, system entry, access control, 
audit trail analysis and availability features for the system 
and for individual users. This allows a system administrator 
to confirm that the system is properly configured and, if 
necessary, to modify the existing configuration and 
attributes. In addition, security management requirements 
provide for routine control and maintenance of system 
resources.

Product documentation requirements for users, 
administrators, and operators describe how to perform 
security relevant functions in a secure manner.

CS3 also extends security management requirements with 
respect to policy-oriented security issues. This includes a 
means to initialize administrative privileges and 
administrative identification, authentication, and system 
entry attributes. Because CS3 compliant systems support 
multiple I&A methods, the administrator is provided with a 
capability to specify an authentication method on a per access 
control attribute basis.

CS3 further extends security management requirements by 
specifying tools for system administration. These tools 
include tools for verifying consistency and proper system 
installation, and for verifying that the TCB does not contain 
extraneous programs or data. 

7.	SECURITY BREACHES MAY OCCUR BECAUSE OF TCB PENETRATION

TCB protection is a fundamental capability of CS compliant 
products. The security components and mechanisms described in 
this Protection Profile depend upon the integrity of the TCB 
and on the TCB being isolated and non-circumventable. CS1 
specifies requirements for a common and basic set of security 
features to protect the TCB from outside penetration.

This threat is also countered through product assurance. 
The TCB interface definition establishes the boundary between 
the TCB and its internal users. Security functional testing 
establishes that these TCB definitions and properties satisfy 
the requirements of this Protection Profile and provides 
evidence against TCB penetration.

This threat is also countered through penetration testing. 
The penetration analysis evidence includes, in addition to 
penetration test plans and results configured in the same 
manner as the security functional testing evidence, the 
documentation of the penetration-resistance testing methods 
and tools, conditions that were verified, the outcomes of the 
verification and, when appropriate, the scenario of the 
discovered penetration flaws. Also, the developer must show 
that all discovered flaws have been eliminated and that no new 
flaws have been introduced. The cause of every discovered 
penetration flaw, or class of penetration flaws, must also be 
documented. At the CS3 level of trust, the system developer 
also must illustrate how, in addition to system reference 
manuals and TCB interface descriptions, the DIS, source code, 
and hardware and firmware specifications are used to define 
penetration test conditions. Also, for each test, the system 
developer must document all test conditions, data, and 
coverage.

8.	USERS MAY BE ABLE TO BYPASS THE SECURITY FEATURES OF THE 
SYSTEM

This threat is countered by authentication, access control, 
audit, TCB isolation, TCB non-circumventability, and 
reference mediation requirements. Authentication requirements 
protect authentication data from unauthorized users. Resource 
access control requirements protect access control data.

Audit requirements provide for the logging of successful 
and unsuccessful accesses to resources as well as for changes 
made to the system security configuration and system software 
in the event that the system security features have been 
bypassed.

CS1 specifications for reference mediation protects the 
integrity of the access control mechanism and the TCB's 
functionality. Starting at CS1, requirements exist for TCB 
mediation of user references to objects and to security 
relevant services. 

CS1-compliant products maintain a domain for its own 
execution to protect it from external interference and 
tampering. Such requirements address TCB isolation and non-
circumventability of TCB isolation functions. 

This threat is also countered through product assurance. 
The definition of TCB properties assures the consistency of 
the TCB's behavior. The identification of TCB elements 
provides the set of elements that determine the protection 
characteristics of a product. The TCB interface definition 
establishes the boundary between the TCB and its internal 
users. Security functional testing establishes that these TCB 
definitions and properties satisfy the requirements of the 
Protection Profile, and provide evidence against subjects 
being able to bypass the security features of the system. At 
the CS2 level, procedures also have to be established for 
developers to accept customer reports of protection problems 
and requests for corrections to those problems. Also, when the 
product is delivered, all security related parameters must be 
set to its fail-safe defaults.

9.	SUBJECTS MAY BE DENIED CONTINUED ACCESSIBILITY TO THE 
RESOURCES OF THE SYSTEM (I.E., DENIAL OF SERVICE)

Reliability of service requirements promote the continued 
accessibility of system resources by authorized subjects. 
These requirements principally counter threats related to 
intentional or unintentional denial of service attacks. The 
requirements include detecting and reporting facilities, 
features to monitor and control the consumption of disk space 
and CPU usage, controls to limit systematically the disabling 
of user identifiers, mechanisms for recovery in the event of 
a system crash, resource quotas, destruction of errant 
processes and facilities for software, and data backup and 
restoration. In particular, mechanisms are specified for 
recovery and system start-up, and for a maintenance mode of 
operation.

CS3 compliant systems provide the capability to detect and 
recover from discontinuity of service using some combination 
of automatic and procedural techniques. This capability is 
intended to counter the threat that subjects may be denied 
continued accessibility to the resources of the system (i.e., 
denial of service). Also, users are notified in advance to 
change their password, so that access to the system is not 
denied without warning. An advisory capability exists to allow 
a system administrator to use null passwords during system 
start-up. This allows a system administrator to access the 
system even if the password mechanism has been compromised. 
In addition, audit trails are compressed to avoid excessive 
consumption of disk space. 

CS3 provides the capability to place restrictions on the 
number of subjects and objects a user may have allocated at 
any given time. Such capabilities provide protection against 
a single user denying access to another user's subject and 
object space. Resource quota requirements are extended to 
require auditing when attempts are made to violate resource 
allocation limits. 

At the CS3 level, an optional capability can be provided to 
detect and report conditions that degrade service below a 
system-specifiable minimum. Also, CS3 provides enhanced TCB 
checking capabilities by extending TCB checks to not only 
hardware and firmware but also to software elements (i.e., 
code and data structures). 

10.	THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM MAY BE COMPROMISED

At the CS3 level, requirements are specified for TCB 
recovery and start-up to promote the secure state of the 
system in the event of a system failure or discontinuity of 
service. These features are intended to minimize the 
likelihood of the loss of user objects during system recovery.

To protect audit trail data, a mechanism is specified to 
automatically copy the audit trail file to an alternative 
storage area. Also, mechanisms that guarantee the consistency 
of the audit trail data after system failures and 
discontinuity of operation is provided.

CS2 compliant products provide the capability to validate 
the correct operation of the TCB software, firmware, and 
hardware. Such features are important to ensure that the 
software, hardware, and firmware are in working order. 

Requirements for the physical security of the TCB and of 
functions and devices that establish physical control over the 
TCB are identified and provided. In addition, power-on tests, 
loadable tests and operator-controlled tests are specified to 
validate the correct operation of the TCB hardware and 
firmware. 

CS3 also extends the TCB initialization and recovery 
capabilities by specifying requirements for automatic 
procedures to protect the secure state of the system in the 
event of a system failure or discontinuity of service. Also, 
automated procedures are provided to assure that after system 
failure or discontinuity of operations a secure state is 
obtained without undue loss of system or user objects. 

CS3 extends the TCB initialization and recovery 
capabilities by specifying automated procedures to assure 
that after system failure, other discontinuity, or start-up, 
a secure state is obtained without undue loss of system or 
user objects.

At the CS3 level, tools are specified to verify the 
consistency of audit data and also to check for storage medium 
and file system integrity. An optional capability is provided 
to allow for the encryption of data to preserve the integrity 
of data in an object.

In addition, fail-safe defaults are specified for the 
access control attributes of subjects, objects, and services 
used in common system configurations.
CS3 Functionality

3.	Introduction

This section provides detailed functionality requirements 
that must be satisfied by an Commercial Security 3 (CS3) 
compliant product. Note that all plain text are words taken 
directly from CS2 `s functionality chapter for the components 
or, for those components not included in CS2, directly from 
the Federal Criteria. Any assignments or refinements that were 
made at CS2 are indicated by italics. Any assignments or 
refinements made to the text in CS2 or the Federal Criteria 
are indicated by bold italics. A Protection Profile 
requirement is an assignment when it is directly taken as 
stated from the component without change or when a binding is 
made to a Federal Criteria threshold definition. A Protection 
Profile requirement is a refinement when the requirement is 
taken to a lower level of abstraction.The characterization of 
Protection Profile requirements as being either assignments 
or refinements can be found at each component level. Also, 
note that, unlike the Federal Criteria, there are some items 
that are considered to be "advisory," i.e.,an item marked 
advisory is a desirable feature but is not required for that 
component. Each advisory item is marked with an "(A)".

This Protection Profile for CS3 utilizes the following 
levels from the Federal Criteria. Note that not all the 
components from the Federal Criteria are reflected in this 
Protection Profile; there are no specific requirements for 
those components that are not listed. Also note that a "+" 
after the component level number indicates that a requirement 
was included from a higher level of that component.

3.1	Identification & Authentication 

All users of the product must be identified and 
authenticated. A login process is established that interacts 
with the user in order to provide the information necessary 
for identification and authentication. The identification and 
authentication process begins the user's interaction with the 
target product. First, the user supplies a unique user 
identifier to the TCB. Then, the user is asked to authenticate 
that claimed identity by the TCB. The user identifier is used 
for accountability. Therefore, the proper maintenance and 
control of the identification mechanism and the 
identification databases are vital to TCB security. Once a 
user has supplied an identifier to the TCB, the TCB must 
verify that the user really corresponds to the claimed 
identifier. This is done by the authentication mechanism as 
described by the following requirements. 

For the CS3 level, I&A-4 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. Refinements were made from CS2 and the Federal 
Criteria to limit the enforcement of separate user 
authentication procedures to system administrators.

 I&A-4 Exception-Controlled Identification and 
Authentication

1.	The TCB shall require users to identify 
themselves to it before beginning to perform any 
other actions that the TCB is expected to mediate. 
The TCB shall be able to enforce individual 
accountability by providing the capability to 
uniquely identify each individual user. The TCB 
shall also provide the capability of associating 
this identity with all auditable actions taken by 
that individual. Furthermore, the TCB shall have 
the capability of associating a unique identity 
with each privileged subject, i.e. transaction 
processing monitors. 

2. 	The TCB shall maintain authentication data that 
includes information for verifying the identity of 
individual users (e.g., passwords), as well as 
information for determining the product policy 
attributes of individual users, i.e. roles. These 
data shall be used by the TCB to authenticate the 
user's identity and to ensure that the attributes 
of subjects external to the TCB that may be 
created to act on behalf of the individual user 
satisfy the product policy. The control of user 
identification data shall be limited to system 
administrators, except that a user shall be 
allowed to modify his/her own authentication data 
within prescribed limits (e.g., changing his/her 
own password).

The TCB shall be able to incorporate and use 
installable authentication mechanisms, such as 
token-based cards, biometrics, or trusted third-
party mechanisms, in the place of or in addition 
to the default authentication (e.g., password-
based) mechanism, to authenticate the user. The 
TCB shall be able to enforce separate user 
authentication procedures based on specific policy 
attributes. The enforcement of separate user 
authentication procedures shall be limited to 
system administrators.

3. 	The TCB shall protect authentication data so 
that it cannot be used by any unauthorized user. 
The TCB shall appear to perform the entire user 
authentication procedure even if the user 
identification entered is invalid. Error feedback 
shall contain no information regarding which part 
of the authentication information is incorrect.

The TCB shall end the attempted login session if 
the user performs the authentication procedure 
incorrectly for a number of successive times 
(i.e., a threshold) specified by an authorized 
system administrator. The default threshold shall 
be three times. When the threshold is exceeded, 
the TCB shall send an alarm message to the system 
console and/or to the administrator's terminal, 
log this event in the audit trail, and delay the 
next login by an interval of time specified by the 
authorized system administrator. The default time 
interval shall be 60 seconds. The TCB shall 
provide a protected mechanism to disable the user 
identity or account when the threshold of 
successive, unsuccessful login attempts is 
violated more than a number of times specified by 
the administrator. By default, this mechanism 
shall be disabled (as it may cause unauthorized 
denial of service).

4. 	The TCB shall have the capability to maintain, 
protect, and display status information for all 
active users (e.g., users currently logged on, 
current policy attributes) and of all user 
accounts (i.e., enabled or disabled user identity 
or account). 

5. Whenever passwords are used as a protection 
mechanism, then, at a minimum:

a.	The TCB shall not indicate to the user if he/she 
has chosen a password already associated with 
another user. 

b.	The TCB shall store passwords in a one-way 
encrypted form. 

(1)	The TCB shall require privilege to access 
encrypted passwords. 

c.	The TCB shall automatically suppress or fully 
blot out the clear-text representation of the 
password on the data entry/display device. 

d.	The TCB shall, by default, prohibit the use of 
null passwords during normal operation. 

(1)	A capability, accessible only to an system 
administrator, to allow null passwords during 
non-normal operations, such as system start-
up, manual recovery, or maintenance mode, on a 
per-user identifier or per-port basis may be 
provided. (A)

e.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
allow a user to change his or her password. This 
mechanism shall require re-authentication of the 
user identity. 

(1)	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
set or initialize passwords for users. The use 
of this mechanism shall be limited to system 
administrators.   

f.	The TCB shall enforce password aging on a per-
user identifier or per-group basis (i.e., a user 
shall be required to change his or her password 
after a system-specifiable minimum time). The 
default for all non-system administrators shall 
be sixty days. 

(1)	The default for system administrator 
identifiers shall be thirty days. 

(2)	After the password aging threshold has been 
reached, the password shall no longer be 
valid, except as provided in 5 g below. 

The control of password aging shall be limited to 
system administrators. 

g.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
notify users in advance of requiring them to 
change their passwords. This can be done by 
either:

(1)	Notifying users a system-specifiable period 
of time prior to their password expiring. The 
default shall be seven days. 

- or -

(2)	Upon password expiration, notifying the user 
but allowing a system-specifiable subsequent 
number of additional logons prior to requiring 
a new password. The default shall be two 
additional logons. 

The control of user password expiration defaults 
shall be limited to system administrators. 

h.	Passwords shall not be reusable by the same user 
identifier for a system-specifiable period of 
time. The default shall be six months. The 
control of password re-use shall be limited to 
system administrators. 

i.	The TCB shall provide an algorithm for ensuring 
the complexity of user-entered passwords that 
meets the following requirements:

(1)	Passwords shall meet a system-specifiable 
minimum length requirement. The default 
minimum length shall be eight characters. 

(2)	The password complexity-checking algorithm 
shall be modifiable by the TCB. The default 
algorithm shall require passwords to include 
at least one alphabetic character, one numeric 
character, and one special character. 

(3)	The TCB should provide a protected mechanism 
that allows systems to specify a list of 
excluded passwords (e.g., company acronyms, 
common surnames). (A)

(a)	The TCB should prevent users from selecting 
a password that matches any of those on the 
list of excluded passwords. (A)

The control of password complexity shall be limited 
to system administrators. 

j.	If password generation algorithms are present, 
they shall meet the following requirements:

(1)	The password generation algorithm shall 
generate passwords that are easy to remember 
(i.e., pronounceable). 

(2)	The TCB should give the user a choice of 
alternative passwords from which to choose. 
(A)

(3)	Passwords shall be reasonably resistant to 
brute-force password guessing attacks. 

(4)			If the "alphabet" used by the password 
generation algorithm consists of syllables 
rather than characters, the security of the 
password shall not depend on the secrecy of the 
alphabet. 

(5)	The generated sequence of passwords shall have 
the property of randomness (i.e., consecutive 
instances shall be uncorrelated and the 
sequences shall not display periodicity). 

3.2	System Entry 

Once a user is authenticated, a check is made to see if the 
user is allowed to access the product. The qualifying checks 
for system entry can include time-of-day, day-of-week, date, 
location of terminal, or means of access (e.g., dial-up port), 
and membership in roles.

For the CS3 level, SE-3 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. An assignment was made from CS2 or the Federal 
Criteria for specifying a role as a user policy attribute.

 SE-3 Session Locking and Unlocking

1. 	Prior to initiating the system login procedure, 
the TCB shall display an advisory warning message 
to the user regarding unauthorized use of the 
system and the possible consequences of failure to 
heed this warning.

a.	The message shall be system-specifiable. 

b.	The TCB shall be able to display a message of up 
to twenty lines in length. 

c.	The following message shall be displayed by 
default: 

"NOTICE: This is a private computer system. 
All users of this system are subject to 
having their activities audited. Anyone 
using this system consents to such 
auditing. All unauthorized entries or 
activities revealed by this auditing can be 
used as evidence and may lead to criminal 
prosecution." 

The control of system entry messages shall be 
limited to system administrators. 

2. 	Before system entry is granted to a user, the 
identity of that user shall be authenticated by 
the TCB. If the TCB is designed to support 
multiple login sessions per user identity, the TCB 
shall provide a protected mechanism to enable 
limiting the number of login sessions per user 
identity or account with a default of a single 
login session. The control of this mechanism to 
limit the number of login sessions shall be 
limited to system administrators. 

3. 	The TCB shall grant system entry only in 
accordance with the authenticated user's policy 
attributes. The system entry conditions shall be 
expressed in terms of users' policy attributes, 
i.e., user identity and membership to roles. If no 
explicit system-entry conditions are defined, the 
system-entry default shall be used (e.g., the 
correct user authentication). The TCB shall 
provide a protected mechanism to allow or deny 
system entry based on specified ranges of time. 
Entry conditions using these ranges shall be 
specified using time-of-day, day-of-week, and 
calendar dates. The control of system entry 
conditions shall be limited to system 
administrators. 

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
allow or deny system entry based on location or 
port of entry. Conditions for system entry via 
dial-up lines (e.g., lists of user identities 
authorized to enter the system via dial-up lines), 
if any, shall be specified.The control of these 
mechanisms shall be limited to system 
administrators.

4. 	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism that 
enables authorized administrators to display and 
modify the policy attributes used in system-entry 
control for each user. The conditions under which 
an unprivileged user may display these attributes 
shall be specified.

5.	Upon a user's successful entry to the system, 
the TCB shall display the following data to the 
user and shall not remove them without user 
intervention: (1) the date, time, means of access 
and port of entry of the last successful entry to 
the system; and (2) the number of successive, 
unsuccessful attempts to access the system since 
the last successful entry by the identified user.

6. 	The TCB shall either lock or terminate an 
interactive session after an administrator-
specified interval of user inactivity. The default 
value for the lock interval shall be five minutes. 
The default value for session termination shall be 
fifteen minutes. The TCB shall also provide a 
mechanism for user-initiated locking of the user's 
own interactive sessions (e.g., keyboard locking) 
that includes: (1) clearing or over-writing 
display devices to make the current contents 
unreadable; (2) requiring user authentication 
prior to unlocking the session; and (3) disabling 
any activity of the user's data entry/display 
devices other than unlocking the session.

3.3	Trusted Path 

A Trusted Path ensures that users have direct, unencumbered 
communication with the TCB. A Trusted Path may be required at 
various times during a subject session and also may be 
initiated by a user during a TCB interaction.

For the CS3 level, TP-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. There are no refinements from CS2 or the Federal 
Criteria. 



 TP-1 Login Trusted Path

The TCB shall support a trusted communication path 
between itself and the user for initial 
identification and authentication. Communications 
via this path shall be initiated exclusively by a 
user.

a.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism by 
which a display device may force a direct 
connection between the port to which it is 
connected and the authentication mechanism. 

3.4	Audit 

Audit supports accountability by providing a trail of user 
actions. Actions are associated with individual users for 
security-relevant events and are stored in an audit trail. 
This audit trail can be examined to determine what happened 
and what user was responsible for a security relevant event. 
The audit trail data must be protected from unauthorized 
access, modification, or destruction. In addition, the audit 
trail data must be available in a useful and timely manner for 
analysis. 

Audit data is recorded from several sources (such as the 
TCB or privileged applications) to produce a complete picture 
of a user's security relevant actions. Therefore, audit data 
must be correlated across audit collection systems. The 
mechanisms providing audit data recording must be tailorable 
to each product's needs. Both the audit data itself and the 
mechanisms to determine what audit data is recorded are 
protected by privileges. Once the audit data is recorded, it 
is analyzed and reported. Reporting can be by reports 
generated on request.

For the CS3 level, AD-3 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. A refinement was made to audit attempts to 
circumvent or gain unauthorized access to resource allocation 
limits.

AD-3 Audit Tools

1.	The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and 
protect from modification or unauthorized access 
or destruction an audit trail of accesses to the 
objects it protects. The audit data shall be 
protected by the TCB so that read access to it is 
limited to those who are authorized for audit 
data.

The TCB shall support an application program 
interface that allows a privileged application to 
append data to the security audit trail or to an 
applications-specified alternative security audit 
trail. 

The TCB should support an option to maintain the 
security audit trail data in encrypted format. (A)

2.	The TCB shall be able to record the following 
types of events:

	- use of the identification and authentication 
mechanisms, and system entry events;

	- access control events selectable on a per 
user, per subject, per object, per role, and/or 
per policy attribute basis; i.e., introduction of 
objects into a user's address space (e.g., file 
open, program initiation), creation and deletion 
of subjects and objects; distribution and 
revocation of access rights; changes of subject 
and object policy attributes; acquisition and 
deletion of system privileges. 

	-actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators and/or system security officers; 
i.e., privileged operations such as the 
modification of TCB elements; accesses to TCB 
objects (at a minimum, access to an object shall 
include disk file access, tape volume, or tape 
file access); changes of policy attributes of 
users, TCB configuration and security 
characteristics, and system privileges; selection 
and modification of audited events.

	- attempts to circumvent or otherwise gain 
unauthorized access to resource allocation limits.

The events that are auditable by default, and 
those that are required for successful auditing of 
other events, which may not be disabled, shall be 
defined. The TCB shall provide a protected 
mechanism that displays the currently selected 
events and their defaults. The use of this 
mechanism shall be restricted to authorized system 
administrators.

3.	For each recorded event, the audit record shall 
identify: date and time of the event, user, type 
of event, and success or failure of the event. For 
identification/authentication events the origin of 
request (e.g., terminal ID) shall be included in 
the audit record. For events that introduce an 
object into a user's address space and for object 
deletion events the audit record shall include the 
name and policy attributes of the object.

The character strings input as a response to a 
password prompt shall not be recorded in the 
security audit trail. 

4.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
turn auditing on and off, and to select and change 
the events to be audited and their defaults, 
during the system operation. The use of this 
mechanism shall be restricted to authorized system 
administrators. The system administrator shall be 
able to selectively audit the actions of one or 
more users based on individual identity and/or 
object policy attributes. Audit review tools shall 
be available to authorized system administrators 
to assist in the inspection and review of audit 
data, and shall be protected from unauthorized 
use, modification, or destruction.

The TCB shall provide tools for audit data 
processing. These shall include specifically 
designed tools: for verifying the consistency of 
the audit data; for verifying the selection of 
audit events; for audit trail management. The 
audit trail management tools shall enable:

	- creation, destruction, and emptying of audit 
trails; use of warning points regarding the size 
of the audit data, and modification of the audit 
trail size;

	-formatting and compressing of event records;

	-displaying of formatted audit trail data; and

	-maintaining the consistency of the audit trail 
data after system failures and discontinuity of 
operation.

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism for 
the automatic copying of security audit trail 
files to an alternative storage area after a 
system-specifiable period of time. 

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism for 
the automatic deletion of security audit trail 
files after a system-specifiable period of time. 
The default shall be thirty days. 

(a)	It shall not be possible to delete the 
security audit trail before it gets copied 
to an alternate storage area. 

(b)	It shall be possible to disable this mechanism. 

The use of audit trail management functions shall 
be limited to system administrators. 

5. 	Audit review tools shall be available to 
authorized users to assist in the inspection and 
review of audit data, and shall be protected from 
unauthorized modification or destruction. The TCB 
shall also provide tools for post-collection audit 
analysis (e.g., intrusion detection) that shall be 
able to selectively review (1) the actions of one 
or more users (e.g., identification, 
authentication, system-entry, and access control 
actions); (2) the actions performed on a specific 
object or system resource; and (3) all, or a 
specified set of, audited exceptions; and (4) 
actions associated with a specific 
policyattributes.The review tools shall be able to 
operate concurrently with the system operation.

3.5	Access Control 

Once the user has been granted access, the question of which 
objects the authenticated user may access still remains. An 
owner, or an authorized user, allows or denies to other users 
access to that object. The requirements below describe subject 
accesses to objects. 

For the CS3 level, AC-2+ was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria.his level is indicated as being AC-2+ because 
requirements were included from level AC-4 (to include the 
requirements for time and location dependency conditions). 
These are indicated in the text by an "[AC-4]" in front of the 
requirement. This component level was refined from CS2 and the 
Federal Criteria by specifying access control decisions based 
on roles.

 AC-2+ Basic Access Control

1.	Definition of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and protect access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. Subject 
attributes shall include named individuals or 
defined roles or both. Object attributes shall 
include defined access rights (i.e., read, write, 
execute) that can be assigned to subject 
attributes.

The TCB shall be able to assign access rights to 
role identities.

If multiple access control policies are supported, 
the access control attributes corresponding to 
each individual policy shall be identified. 

[AC-4]: The subject and object attributes shall 
accurately reflect the sensitivity and/or 
integrity of the subject or object.The subject's 
access control attributes also shall include time 
and location attributes that can be assigned to 
authenticated user identities. 

2.	Administration of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and enforce rules for 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes for subjects and objects.

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism for 
roles as follows: 

a.	A user identifier shall be able to be associated 
with one or more roles. 

b.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
list the names of all roles. 

c.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
list the membership of any role. 

Rules for maintaining role membership shall be 
provided. These rules shall include those for 
displaying and modifying the list of users 
belonging to a role and the role attributes of those 
users. 

The effect of these rules shall be that access 
permission to an object by users not already 
possessing access permission is assigned only by 
authorized users. 

Only the current owner or system administrators 
shall modify access control attributes on objects.

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
modify role membership. The use of this mechanism 
shall be under the control of system 
administrators. Authority to modify specific role 
membership may be delegated. 

The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism by which 
the user identifier associated with a subject 
attribute can be changed while the subject is 
active. It shall also provide a protected mechanism 
for limiting the user identifiers that may change 
to a user identifier that would provide any 
additional access rights. The control of these 
mechanisms shall be limited to system 
administrators. 

[AC-4]: These rules shall allow authorized users 
to specify and control sharing of objects by named 
individuals or defined roles of individuals, or by 
both, and shall provide controls to limit 
propagation of access rights, (i.e., these rules 
shall define the distribution, revocation, and 
review of access control attributes). The controls 
defined by these rules shall be capable of 
specifying for each named object, a list of 
individuals and a list of roles of named 
individuals, with their respective access rights 
to that object. Furthermore, for each named 
object, it shall be possible to specify a list of 
named individuals and a list of roles of named 
individuals for which no access to the object is 
given. These controls shall be capable of 
including or excluding access to the granularity 
of a single user.These controls shall also be 
capable of specifying access-time dependency 
(i.e., the effect of the distribution and 
revocation of access control attributes take place 
at a certain time and shall last for a specified 
period of time), and/or access-location dependency 
(i.e., shall specify the locations from which the 
distribution and revocation of access rights shall 
take place).

The rules for assignment and modification of 
access control attributes shall include those for 
attribute assignment to objects during import and 
export operations. If different rules of 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes apply to different subjects and/or 
objects, the totality of these rules shall be 
shown to support the defined policy.

3.	Authorization of Subject References to Objects

[AC-4]: The TCB shall define and enforce 
authorization rules for the mediation of subject 
references to objects. These rules shall be based 
on the access control attributes of subjects and 
objects. These rules shall, either by explicit 
user action or by default, provide that objects 
are protected from unauthorized access. These 
rules shall include time-of-access and location-
of-access controls defined for subjects and 
objects.

For each object, the authorization rules of the TCB 
shall be based on a protected mechanism to specify 
roles with their specific access rights to that 
object. 

The authorization rules shall be defined in terms 
of subject authorization conditions for accessing 
the object (i.e., on <subject, action, object> 
tuples.

At a minimum, the authorization rules shall be 
defined as follows:

a.	The access rights associated with a user 
identifier shall take precedence over the access 
rights associated with any roles of which that 
user identifier is a member. 

b.	When a user identifier can be an active member of 
multiple roles simultaneously, or if the access 
rights associated with the user identifier 
conflict with the access rights associated with 
any role in which the user is a member, it shall 
be possible for an system administrator to 
configure rules that combine the access rights to 
make a final access control decision. 

c.	The TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
specify default access rights for user 
identifiers not otherwise specified either 
explicitly by a user identifier or implicitly by 
role membership. 

The scope of the authorization rules shall include 
a defined subset of the product's subjects and 
objects and associated access control attributes. 
The coverage of authorization rules shall specify 
the types of objects and subjects to which these 
rules apply. If different rules apply to different 
subjects and objects, the totality of these rules 
shall be shown to support the defined policy. 

If multiple policies are supported, the 
authorization rules for each policy shall be 
defined separately. The TCB shall define and 
enforce the composition of policies, including the 
enforcement of the authorization rules (e.g., 
subject and object type coverage, enforcement 
precedence).

4.	Subject and Object Creation and Destruction

The TCB shall control the creation and destruction 
of subjects and objects. These controls shall 
include object reuse. That is, all authorizations 
to the information contained within a storage 
object shall be revoked prior to initial 
assignment, allocation or reallocation to a 
subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage 
objects; information, including encrypted 
representations of information, produced by a 
prior subjects' actions shall be unavailable to 
any subject that obtains access to an object that 
has been released back to the system.

3.6	Security Management 

The management of security attributes and configuration 
parameters is an important aspect of a secure product. 
Mechanisms have to be provided to easily maintain the product, 
and they must be protected so that only system administrators 
can manage the security aspects of the product. 

For the CS3 level, SM-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. An assignment was made to this component from the 
Federal Criteria to limit the number of login sessions and for 
controlling the availability of system resources. A 
refinement was made to provide system administrators with a 
protected mechanism for grating and revoking role membership.

 SM-3 Policy-Oriented Security Management

1. 	The TCB shall provide an installation mechanism 
for the setting and updating of its configuration 
parameters, and for the initialization of its 
protection-relevant data structures before any 
user or administrator policy attributes are 
defined. It shall allow the configuration of TCB 
internal databases and tables.

The TCB shall distinguish between normal mode of 
operation and maintenance mode, and shall provide 
a maintenance-mode mechanism for recovery and 
system start-up.This mechanism shall include a 
means to initialize administrative privileges and 
administrative identification, authentication, and 
system-entry attributes.

2. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
displaying and modifying the security policy 
parameters. These parameters shall include 
identification, authentication, system entry and 
access control parameters for the entire system 
and for individual users.

The TCB shall have a capability to define the 
identification and authentication policy on a 
system-wide basis (e.g., password minimum and 
maximum lifetime, password length and complexity 
parameters). The TCB mechanisms shall have the 
capability to limit: (1) maximum period of 
interactive session inactivity, (2) maximum login 
or session time, and (3) successive unsuccessful 
attempts to log in to the system. In particular, 
the TCB shall provide a protected mechanism to 
specify that sessions be terminated rather than 
locked after a period of inactivity. The control 
of these mechanisms shall be limited to system 
administrators.The TCB shall provide an 
administrative capability to specify the 
authentication method on a per policy-attribute 
basis whenever multiple identification and 
authentication methods are used; e.g., via user 
passwords, tokens, or biometrics.

	If the TCB is designed to support multiple login 
sessions per user identity, the administrators 
shall be able to limit the number of simultaneous 
login sessions on an authorization-attribute basis. 
The system-supplied default shall limit each user 
identifier to one simultaneous logon session. 

	The TCB shall also have a capability to limit 
the successive unsuccessful attempts to login from 
a specific port of entry, and/or with a specific 
user identity or account.

The TCB shall provide a mechanism to control the 
availability of system resources via resource 
quotas and quantity-of-resources limits. 

3.						 The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
manually displaying, modifying, or deleting user 
registration and account parameters. These 
parameters shall include unique user identifiers, 
their account, and their associated user name and 
affiliation. The TCB shall allow the automatic 
disabling of user identities and/ or accounts, 
after a period during which the identity and/or 
account have not been used. The time period shall 
be administrator specified, with a specified 
default provided. The TCB shall allow the 
automatic re-enabling of disabled user identities 
and/or accounts after an administrator-specified 
period of time.

The TCB shall provide a means to uniquely identify 
security policy attributes. It shall also provide 
a means of listing all these attributes for a 
user, and all the users associated with an 
attribute. It shall be capable of defining and 
maintaining the security policy attributes for 
subjects including: defining and maintaining 
privileges for privileged subjects, discretionary 
and non-discretionary attributes, i.e., definition 
and maintenance of roles, and centralized 
distribution, review and revocation of policy 
attributes. 

System administrators shall be provided with a 
protected mechanism for the purposes of granting 
and revoking user membership to specific roles. 
Administrative users shall also be provided with 
tools for the creation of roles and for the 
definition of role attributes. 

4. 	The TCB shall support separate operator and 
administrator functions. The operator functions 
shall be restricted to those necessary for 
performing routine operations. The operator 
functions allow the enabling and disabling of 
peripheral devices, mounting of removable storage 
media, backing-up and recovering user objects; 
maintaining the TCB hardware and software elements 
(e.g., on site testing); and starting and shutting 
down the system.

5. 	 The use of the protected mechanisms for system 
administration shall be limited to authorized 
administrative users. The control of access-
control attributes shall be limited to the object 
owner and to system administrators. 

3.7	Reference Mediation 

Reference mediation, that is, the control by the TCB of 
subject accesses to objects, must be ensured so that the users 
can have faith in the TCB's access control decisions. Also, 
users must be ensured that all access to security services are 
mediated by the TCB.    

For the CS3 level, RM-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from CS2 or the Federal 
Criteria.

 RM-1 Mediation of References to a Defined Subject/Object 
Subset

1. 	The TCB shall mediate all references to 
subjects, objects, resources, and services (e.g., 
TCB functions) described in the TCB 
specifications. The mediation shall ensure that 
all references are directed to the appropriate 
security-policy functions.

2.	Reference mediation shall include references to 
the defined subset of subjects, objects, and 
resources protected under the TCB security policy, 
and to their policy attributes, i.e., role 
identifiers.

3. 	References issued by privileged subjects shall 
be mediated in accordance with the policy 
attributes defined for those subjects.

3.8	Resource-Allocation Requirements

This component restricts the allocation of subjects and 
objects so that no one user through the exhaustion of resource 
can deny service to other users. It further enables the TCB 
to prioritize subject access to resources so that the highest 
priority subject is given preferential treatment in its access 
to objects. 

For CS3l, AR-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. This 
component was refined from the Federal Criteria by limiting 
the control of the capability to place restrictions on the 
number of subjects and objects to system administrators.

LEVEL - AR-1 Resource Restrictions

The TCB shall provide the capability to place 
restrictions on the number of subjects and objects a user 
may have allocated at any given time. The control of this 
capability shall be limited to system administrators. 
The TCB shall control a defined set of system resources 
(e.g., memory, disk space) such that no one individual 
user can deny access to another user's subject and object 
space. All subjects, objects, and resources shall be 
defined with default space or time quota and number-of-
resources attributes. 

3.9	TCB Protection 

TCB protection is a fundamental requirement for a secure 
product. All of the security components and mechanisms that 
have been described depend upon the integrity of the TCB and 
on the TCB being isolated and non-circumventable. The TCB must 
be resistant to outside penetration. 

For the CS3 level, P-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from CS2 or the Federal 
Criteria.

P-1 Basic TCB Isolation

The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own 
execution that protects it from external 
interference and tampering (e.g., by reading or 
modification of its code and data structures). The 
protection of the TCB shall provide TCB isolation 
and noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions as follows:

	1. TCB Isolation requires that (1) the address 
spaces of the TCB and those of unprivileged 
subjects are separated such that users, or 
unprivileged subjects operating on their behalf, 
cannot read or modify TCB data structures or code, 
(2) the transfers between TCB and non-TCB domains 
are controlled such that arbitrary entry to or 
return from the TCB are not possible; and (3) the 
user or application parameters passed to the TCB 
by addresses are validated with respect to the TCB 
address space, and those passed by value are 
validated with respect to the values expected by 
the TCB.

	2. Noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions requires that the permission to objects 
(and/or to non-TCB data) passed as parameters to 
the TCB are validated with respect to the 
permissions required by the TCB, and references to 
TCB objects implementing TCB isolation functions 
are mediated by the TCB.

3.10	Physical TCB Protection 

Whenever the physical security of a product cannot be 
established, then all of the software controls that have been 
put into place are of no consequence. Therefore, physical TCB 
protection is just as important as software protection. 
Physical protection is based on a product's ability to 
prevent, deter, detect, and counter physical attacks against 
the product. Devices used to counter physical attacks must be 
shown to be tamper-resistant and non-circumventable. 

For the CS3 level, PP-1 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No further refinements were made from the Federal 
Criteria.

PP-1 Administrative and Environment Protection

1. Administrative procedures and environmental 
features necessary for establishing the physical 
security of a product's TCB shall be defined.

2. Product functions and devices necessary to 
establish physical control over the product's TCB 
shall be identified and provided.

3.11	TCB Self-Checking 

Validating the correct operation of the TCB firmware and 
hardware is an important aspect of guaranteeing the integrity 
of the product. Hardware and software features that validate 
the correct operation of the product will be delivered with 
the product to ensure that the hardware and firmware are 
installed properly and are in working order.

For the CS3 level, SC-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. The refinements from CS2 and the Federal Criteria 
include providing for an encryption mechanism to preserve the 
integrity of object data and providing for a tool to check for 
storage medium and file system integrity, and for having 
system operators perform operator-controlled tests. An 
assignment was made to the configurable software features to 
monitor system services and the corruption of access control 
information. 

SC-3 Software-Test Support

Hardware and/or software features shall be 
provided that can be used to periodically validate 
the correct operation of the on-site hardware and 
firmware elements of the TCB. These features shall 
include: power-on tests, loadable tests, and 
operator-controlled tests.

The power-on tests shall test all basic components 
of the TCB hardware and firmware elements 
including memory boards and memory 
interconnections; data paths; busses; control 
logic and processor registers; disk adapters; 
communication ports; system consoles, and the 
keyboard speaker. These tests shall cover all 
components that are necessary to run the loadable 
tests and the operator-controlled tests. 

The loadable tests shall cover: processor 
components (e.g., arithmetic and logic unit, 
floating point unit, instruction decode buffers, 
interrupt controllers, register transfer bus, 
address translation buffer, cache, and processor-
to-memory bus controller); backplane busses; 
memory controllers; writable control memory for 
operator-controlled and remote system-integrity 
testing. 

Operator-controlled tests shall be able to 
initiate a series of one-time or repeated tests, 
to log the results of these tests and, if any fault 
is detected, to direct the integrity-test programs 
to identify and isolate the failure.The execution 
of operator-controlled tests shall be limited to 
system operators. 

Configurable software or firmware features shall 
be provided that can be used to validate the 
correct operation of the on-site software elements 
(i.e., code and data structures) of the TCB. These 
features may include, but are not limited to, 
checksums and consistency checks for TCB elements 
stored on storage media (e.g., disk-block 
consistency invariants).

a.	At a minimum, these features shall also address:

(1)	Monitoring of system services 

(2)	Corruption of access control information. 

The TCB should provide an encryption mechanism that 
can be used to preserve the integrity of data in an 
object. (A) 

The TCB shall provide tools for checking storage 
medium and file system integrity. 

a.	The TCB shall execute these tools periodically. 

3.12	TCB Initialization and Recovery 

The recovery and start-up of the TCB must be ensured so that 
the product always remains in a secure state, whether the 
recovery is performed manually or automatically. 

For the CS3 level, TR-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. An assignment was made at this component level to 
specify that audit control data shall survive system restarts.

TR-3 Automated Recovery or Start-up

1. Procedures and/or mechanisms shall be provided 
to assure that, after a TCB failure or other 
discontinuity, recovery without protection 
compromise is obtained. At a minimum, audit 
control data (e.g., audit event masks) shall 
survive system restarts. 

2. Automated procedures, under the control of the 
TCB, shall be provided to assure that after a 
system failure, other discontinuity, or start-up, 
a secure state is obtained without undue loss of 
system or user objects. The security policy 
properties, or requirements, used to determine 
that a secure state is obtained shall be defined.

3.13	Privileged Operation 

Privileges are associated with functional components so 
that at any given time only those operations that are 
associated with the privilege can be performed. The privileges 
that a product needs must be identified and must cover all the 
security aspects of the product, including the secure 
administration of the product, and should be defined so that 
there is not a single privileged mode for all of the TCB's 
operations. 

For the CS3 level, PO-2 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. A refinement was made from CS2 and the Federal 
Criteria by specifying that privileges be associated with 
administrative roles and for controlling access to role 
registration files.

 PO-2 Privilege Association with TCB Modules

1. TCB privileges needed by individual functions, 
or groups of functions, of a functional component 
shall be identified. Privileged TCB calls or 
access to privileged TCB objects, such as user and 
group and role registration files, password files, 
security and integrity-level definition file, role 
definition file, audit-log file shall also be 
identified. It shall be possible to associate TCB 
privileges with TCB operations performed by 
administrative users (i.e., administrative roles). 

2.The modules of a TCB function shall be 
associated only with the privileges necessary to 
complete their task. 

3. Support for product privilege implementation 
and association with TCB modules provided by 
lower-level mechanisms or procedures (e.g., 
operating system, processors, language) shall be 
provided.

3.14	Ease-of-TCB-Use 

If security mechanisms are not easy to use and maintain, 
then administrative and non-system administrators may be 
tempted to disable the security mechanisms. Therefore, ease 
of use becomes an important element in the administration of 
a secure product and in the creation of privileged 
applications. It also minimizes errors on the part of both the 
administrative and non-system administrators, and can serve 
to minimize the consequences of these errors. 

For the CS3 level, EU-3 was assigned from the Federal 
Criteria. No refinements were made from CS2 or the Federal 
Criteria.

EU-3 Common Configuration Coverage

1. The TCB shall provide well-defined actions to 
undertake administrative functions. Fail-safe 
default options shall be provided for security 
parameters of administrative functions.

The TCB shall include fail-safe defaults for the 
policy attributes of subjects, objects (e.g., 
devices) and services used in common system 
configurations, as well as user-setable defaults 
for these subjects and objects. 

2. The TCB shall provide well-defined application 
programming interfaces and programming functions 
(e.g., libraries) for all its policies to support 
the development of applications that can define 
and enforce security policies on application-
controlled subjects and objects. The TCB shall 
enable user-controlled reduction of permissions 
available to applications.

CS3 Assurance 

4.	Introduction

This chapter provides the CS3 development and evaluation 
assurance requirements package using the development and 
evaluation assurance components defined in Volume I and the 
package contained in Volume I, Appendix G of the Federal 
Criteria. The structure of each assurance package follows that 
of the assurance components (i.e., each package consists of 
development process, operational support, development 
environment, development evidence, and evaluation process 
components). 

Assurance Package T3+

The enhanced assurance level is intended to include the 
best of the commercial computer products designed to satisfy 
functional requirements. As such this package includes 
several extensions to the assurance components of the previous 
two packages. 

The intent of product development assurance for this 
package is both to establish that the external behavior of the 
product conforms to its user level and administrative 
documentation and to provide visibility into the internal 
structure of the product TCB. For this reason, requirements 
for Descriptive Interface Specifications (DIS) and modular 
decomposition have been added. The TCB element identification 
and functional testing, have also been extended and 
penetration testing requirements added to support the added 
assurances of external behavior. 

The intent of the operational support assurance for this 
package is to establish a level of user and administrative 
guidance and product information that enables the correct 
product installation and use of product security features. The 
developer is required to establish and document a policy for 
responding to customer inquiries and flaw remediation. 
Similarly, the development environment assurances are 
intended to provide the a level of control over the product 
configuration and production, including well-defined coding 
standards and strict configuration management processes. This 
level of development environment assurance is similar to that 
used in the most advanced commercial development 
organizations.

The development evidence required for this package is 
commensurate with the assurances required. The intent of this 
package is to require the type of assurance evidence that is 
generated during commercial development oriented towards of 
high-quality products.

The intent of evaluation support assurance is to establish 
that the product, and the context in which it is developed and 
supported, is commensurate with the development assurance 
requirements. At the T3+ level, testing analysis and the 
requirement for independent testing determines whether the 
product meets the functional protection requirements. 
Operational support evaluation assurance determines whether 
the product documentation correctly describes the security 
relevant operations. Development environment assurance 
determines whether the product meets the requirements as 
defined in the protection profile's development assurance 
subsections. Design assurance determines whether the product 
meets the design requirements as defined in the Development 
Process Assurance section of this Protection Profile. 

Also for CS3, flaw remediation was included in this 
package. Flaw remediation is important for commercial 
environments since it ensures that flaws (i.e, deficiencies 
in a product that enables a user external to the TCB to violate 
the functional requirements of a protection profile) that are 
discovered by the product consumers will be tracked, 
corrected, and disseminated to the affected customers.

The following table summarizes the assurance components 
that comprise T3+. Note that this package is indicated as 
being T3+ since an additional component was included for flaw 
remediation. Also note that the requirement for role based 
administrative guidance was included from level AG-3 and is 
indicated in the table below as "AG-2+" and in the component 
text by the insertion of "[AG-3]"at the beginning of the 
paragraph.

4.1	TCB Property Definition

The definition of TCB properties assures the consistency of 
the TCB's behavior. It determines a baseline set of properties 
that can be used by system developers and evaluators to assure 
that the TCB satisfies the defined functional requirements.

For CS3, PD-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 PD-2 Informal Property Definition

The developer shall provide informal models for 
the functional components and sub-components of 
the profile. At a minimum, an informal model of 
the access control components shall be provided. 
Each informal model shall include (abstract) data 
structures and operations defining each functional 
component or sub-component, and a description of 
the model properties. The developer shall 
interpret (e.g., trace) the informal models within 
the product TCB. For each model entity, the 
developer shall: (1) identify the TCB elements and 
their TCB interfaces (if any) that implement that 
entity; (2) define the operation of these TCB 
elements, and (3) explain why the operation of 
these elements is consistent with the model 
properties. The developer's interpretation of each 
informal model, which defines the TCB properties, 
shall identify all TCB elements that do not 
correspond to any model entity and shall explain 
why these elements do not render the TCB 
properties invalid.

For the components that are not informally 
modeled, the developer shall interpret the 
functional requirements of the protection profile 
within the product TCB. For each functional 
requirement, the developer shall: (1) identify the 
TCB elements and their TCB interfaces (if any) 
that implement that requirement; (2) describe the 
operation of these TCB elements, and (3) explain 
why the operation of these elements is consistent 
with the functional requirement. The developer's 
interpretation of each functional requirement, 
which describes the TCB properties, shall identify 
all TCB elements that do not correspond to any 
functional requirement and shall explain why these 
elements do not render the TCB properties invalid.

4.2	TCB Element Identification

The identification of TCB elements (hardware, firmware, 
software, code, and data structures) provides the set of 
elements that determine the protection characteristics of a 
product. All assurance methods rely on the correct 
identification of TCB elements either directly or indirectly.

For CS3, ID-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 ID-2: TCB Element Justification

The developer shall identify the TCB elements 
(i.e., software, hardware/firmware code and data 
structures). Each element must be unambiguously 
identified by its name, type, release, and version 
number (if any).

The developer shall justify the protection 
relevance of the identified elements (i.e., only 
elements that can affect the correct operation of 
the protection functions shall be included in the 
TCB). If protection-irrelevant elements are 
included in the TCB, the developer shall provide a 
rationale for such inclusion.

4.3	TCB Interface Definition

The TCB interface establishes the boundary between the TCB 
and its external users and application programs. It consists 
of several components, such as command interfaces (i.e., user 
oriented devices such as the keyboard and mouse), application 
program interfaces (system calls), and machine/processor 
interfaces (processor instructions).

For CS3, IF-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

IF-1: Interface Description

The developer shall describe all external (e.g., 
command, software, and I/O) administrative (i.e., 
privileged) and non-administrative interfaces to 
the TCB. The description shall include those 
components of the TCB that are implemented as 
hardware and/or firmware if their properties are 
visible at the TCB interface.

The developer shall identify all call conventions 
(e.g., parameter order, call sequence 
requirements) and exceptions signaled at the TCB 
interface.

TCB Structuring Support

Structuring the TCB into modules is necessary. However, the 
modular decomposition does not necessarily reflect the run-
time enforcement of the TCB structuring since the separation 
of modules may not necessarily be supported by run-time 
mechanisms. The run-time enforcement of internal TCB 
structuring adds a measure of assurance that the TCB elements 
that are critical to the enforcement of the protection 
functions are separate from the non-critical elements. Also, 
the use of run-time enforcement of TCB structuring helps 
separate protection-critical TCB elements from each other, 
thereby helping to enforce the separation of protection 
concerns and minimizing the common mechanisms shared between 
protection critical elements.

For CS3, SP-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 SP-1: Process Isolation

The TCB shall maintain process isolation.

4.4	Developer Functional Testing

Functional testing establishes that the TCB interface 
exhibits the properties necessary to satisfy the requirements 
of the protection profile. It provides assurance that the TCB 
satisfies at least its functional protection requirements.

For CS3, FT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 FT-1: Conformance Testing

The developer shall test the TCB interface to show 
that all claimed protection functions work as 
stated in the TCB interface description.

The developer shall correct all flaws discovered 
by testing and shall retest the TCB until the 
protection functions are shown to work as claimed.

4.5	Penetration Analysis

Penetration analysis is an important assurance component 
since the effectiveness of all security policies rely on the 
penetration resistance of the TCB. TCB penetration analysis 
consists of the identification and confirmation of flaws in 
the design and implementation of protection functions that can 
be exploited by unprivileged users or untrusted application 
programs.

For CS3, PA-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 PA-1 Basic Penetration Testing

The developer shall define the TCB configuration, 
interface, and protection functions that are 
subject to penetration testing. For each test, the 
developer shall identify the goal of the test and 
the criteria for successful penetration. The 
developer shall identify all product documentation 
(e.g., system reference manuals) used to define 
penetration-test conditions, and shall document 
all test conditions, data (e.g., test set-up, 
function call parameters, and test outcomes), and 
coverage. 

The penetration testing shall include, at a 
minimum, known classes of penetration flaws found 
in other TCBs (e.g., generic penetration flaws). 
For each uncovered flaw, the developer shall 
define and document scenarios of flaw 
exploitation, and shall identify all penetration 
outcomes resulting from that scenario. 

4.6	User's Guidance

User's guidance is an operational support assurance 
component that ensures that usage constraints assumed by the 
protection profile are understood by the users of the product. 
It is the primary means available for providing product users 
with the necessary background and specific information on how 
to correctly use the product's protection functionality.

For CS3, UG-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 UG-1: Users' Guide

The developer shall provide a Users' Guide which 
describes all protection services provided and 
enforced by the TCB. The User's Guide shall 
describe the interaction between these services 
and provide examples of their use. The User's 
Guide may be in the form of a summary, chapter or 
manual. The User's Guide shall specifically 
describe user responsibilities. These shall 
encompass any user responsibilities identified in 
the protection profile.

4.7	Administrative Guidance

Administrative guidance is an operation support assurance 
component that ensures that the environmental constraints 
assumed by the protection profile are understood by 
administrative users and operators of the IT product. It is 
the primary means available to the developer for providing to 
administrators and operators detailed, accurate information 
on how to configure and install the product, operate the IT 
product is a secure manner, make effective use of the 
product's privileges and protection mechanisms to control 
access to administrative functions and data bases, and to 
avoid pitfalls and improper use of the administrative 
functions that would compromise the TCB and user security.

For CS3, AG-2+ was assigned from the Federal Criteria. This 
level is indicated as being "AG-2+" because requirements were 
included from AG-3 for role based administrative guidance. 
This is indicated in the text by an "[AG-3]" in front of the 
paragraph and through the use of bold italics.

 AG-2+: Detailed Administrative Guidance

[AG-3]: The developer shall provide a Trusted 
Facility Manual intended for the product 
administrators and operators that describes how to 
use the TCB security services (e.g., Access 
Control, System Entry, or Audit) to enforce a 
system security policy. The Trusted Facility 
Manual shall include the procedures for securely 
configuring, starting, maintaining, and halting 
the TCB. The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain 
how to analyze audit data generated by the TCB to 
identify and document user and administrator 
violations of this policy. The Trusted Facility 
Manual shall explain the unique security-relevant 
privileges and functions of administrators and 
operators. The Trusted Facility Manual shall also 
explain the distinct security-relevant privileges 
and functions of the TCB and how they can be 
selectively granted to provide fine-grained, 
multi-role system and application administration 
policies. The Trusted Facility Manual shall 
describe the administrative interaction between 
security services.

The Trusted Facility Manual shall identify all 
hardware, firmware, software, and data structures 
comprising the TCB. The detailed audit record 
structure for each type of audit event shall be 
described. If covert channel handling is required, 
the Trusted Facility Manual shall explain how 
configure the product to mitigate, eliminate, or 
audit covert channel exploitation.The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall describe the cautions about 
and procedures for using the TCB as a base for 
site-specific secure applications. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall describe procedures for 
securely regenerating the TCB after any part is 
changed (e.g., due to adding devices or installing 
flaw corrections to the TCB software).

The Trusted Facility Manual shall be distinct from 
User Guidance, and encompass any administrative 
responsibilities identified in security 
management.

4.8	Flaw Remediation Procedures

Flaw remediation is an operational support assurance 
component that ensures that flaws (i.e, deficiencies in the 
product that enable a user external to the TCB to violate the 
functional requirements of a protection profile) that are 
discovered by the product consumers will be tracked and 
corrected while the product is supported by the developer.

For CS3, FR-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 FR-2: Flaw Reporting Procedures

Flaw Tracking Procedures: The developer shall 
establish a procedure to track all reported 
protection flaws with each release of the product. 
The tracking system shall include a description of 
the nature and effect of each flaw and the status 
of finding a correction to the flaw.

Flaw Repair Procedures: The developer shall 
establish a procedure to identify corrective 
actions for protection flaws. This procedure shall 
include a policy to separate protection-relevant 
from non-protection relevant corrections, changes, 
or upgrades to the product.

Consumer Interaction Procedures: The developer 
shall establish a procedure for accepting consumer 
reports of protection problems and requests for 
corrections to those problems. The developer shall 
designate one or more specific points of contact 
for consumer reports and inquiries about 
protection issues involving the product. This 
procedure and the designated points of contact 
shall be provided in the consumer documentation 
(e.g., the TFM or the SFUG).

4.9	Trusted Generation

Trusted generation is an operational support assurance 
component that ensures that the copy of the product's TCB that 
is configured and activated by the consumer exhibits the same 
protection properties as the master copy of the product's TCB 
that was evaluated for compliance with the protection profile. 
The trusted generation procedures must provide some 
confidence that the consumer will be aware of what product 
configuration parameters can affect the protection properties 
of the TCB. The procedures must encourage the consumer to 
choose parameter settings that are within the bounds assumed 
during the product evaluation.

For CS3, TG-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 TG-2: Trusted Generation With Fail-Safe Defaults

The developer shall establish and document the 
procedures that a customer must perform to 
generate an operational TCB from the delivered 
copy of the master TCB. The customer documentation 
shall identify any system parameters, which are 
initialized or set during system generation, that 
affect the TCB's conformance to the protection 
profile and state the acceptable ranges of values 
for those parameters. The product shall be 
delivered with each of these parameters set to its 
fail-safe defaults.

4.10	Life Cycle Definition

Life cycle definition is an assurance component for 
establishing that the business practices used by a developer 
to produce the product's TCB include the considerations and 
activities identified by the development process and 
operational support requirements of the protection profile. 
Consumer confidence in the correspondence between the 
protection profile requirements and the product's TCB is 
greater when security analysis and the production of evidence 
are done on a regular basis as a integral part of the 
development process and operational support activities.

For CS3, LC-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 LC-1: Developer-Defined Life Cycle Process

The developer shall describe the process used to 
develop and maintain the product. The process 
shall incorporate a security policy that states 
the technical, physical, procedural, personnel, 
and other measures used by the developer to 
protect the product and its documentation. The 
developer shall trace each development process and 
support process requirement of the protection 
profile to the part, or parts, of the developer's 
process where the requirement is satisfied. The 
developer shall identify the programming languages 
used to develop the TCB software.

4.11	Configuration Management

Configuration management is an assurance component that 
ensures that the product's TCB configuration remains 
consistent and complete, and that changes to the TCB do not 
adversely affect the protection properties of the TCB. 
Configuration management must ensure that additions, 
deletions, or changes to the TCB do not compromise the 
correspondence between the TCB's implementation and the 
requirements of the protection profile. This is accomplished 
by requiring the developer to have procedures or tools that 
ensure that the TCB and its documents are updated properly 
with the TCB changes.

For CS3, CM-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 CM-1: Procedural Control and Generation

The developer shall establish configuration 
control and generation procedures for developing 
and maintaining the TCB. The procedures shall be 
employed to ensure that changes to the TCB are 
consistent with the product's protection 
properties and security policy. The developer 
shall employ these procedures to track changes to 
development evidence, implementation data (e.g., 
source code and hardware diagrams), executable 
versions of the TCB, test documentation and 
procedures, identified flaws, and consumer 
documentation.

The configuration control procedures shall permit 
the regeneration of any supported version of the 
TCB.

4.12	Evidence of TCB Protection Properties

The documentation of the TCB protection properties includes 
the definition of the functional component requirements, 
their modeling (if any), and their interpretation within a 
product's TCB. For each requirement of a protection profile, 
a description, definition (an informal, descriptive 
specification), or a formal specification of the TCB 
components and their operation corresponding to the 
requirement must be provided.

For CS3, EPP-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPP-2 Evidence of Informal Model Interpretation in the TCB

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. The developer shall also 
provide an informal access control model and its 
interpretation within the TCB. The TCB properties, 
which are defined by this correspondence, shall be 
explained in this documentation.



4.13	Evidence of Product Development

Product development evidence consists of the TCB design 
evidence including the documentation of the TCB interface, TCB 
elements, TCB structure, TCB structuring support, and TCB 
design disciplines. The TCB implementation evidence includes 
TCB source code, and the processor hardware and firmware 
specifications.

For CS3, EPD-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPD-1: Description Of The TCB External Interface

The developer shall provide an accurate 
description of the functions, effects, exceptions 
and error messages visible at the TCB interface.

The developer shall provide a list of the TCB 
elements (hardware, software, and firmware).

4.14	Evidence of Functional Testing

Functional testing evidence includes the testing itself, 
the test plans, and test documentation results. Test plans 
consist of: the description definition or specification of the 
test conditions; the test data, which consists of the test 
environment set-up; the test parameters and expected 
outcomes; and a description of the test coverage. 

For CS3, EFT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EFT-1: Evidence of Conformance Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of the 
functional testing that includes the test plan, 
the test procedures and the results of the 
functional testing.

4.15	Evidence of Penetration Analysis

The penetration analysis evidence includes, in addition to 
penetration test plans and results configured in the same 
manner as the functional testing evidence, the documentation 
of the penetration-resistance testing methods and tools, 
conditions that were verified, the outcomes of the 
verification and, when appropriate, the scenario of the 
discovered penetration flaws. The cause of every discovered 
penetration flaw, or class of penetration flaws, must also be 
documented.

For CS3, EPA-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPA-1: Evidence of Penetration Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of 
penetration testing. The evidence shall identify 
all product documentation on which the search for 
flaws was based. The penetration evidence shall 
describe the scenarios for exploiting each 
potential flaw in the system and the penetration 
test conditions, data (e.g., test set-up, function 
call parameters, and test outcomes), coverage, and 
conclusions derived from each scenario.

4.16	Evidence of Product Support

Product support evidence consists of the development 
environment and operational support documentation and tools. 
The development environment evidence includes the 
documentation of the product life-cycle process, 
configuration management procedures enforced, and the trusted 
distribution mechanisms and procedures used. It also 
includes: the identification of the tools used in the product 
development, configuration management, and trusted 
distribution; and the characteristics that make those tools 
suitable for the development of product protection.

For CS3, EPS-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 EPS-1: Evidence of Basic Product Support

The developer shall provide evidence that 
describes the policies, procedures, and plans 
established by the developer to satisfy the 
Operational Support and Development Environment 
requirements of the protection profile. 

4.17	Test Analysis

Test analysis determines whether the product meets the 
functional protection requirements defined in the protection 
profile. Functional testing is based on operational product, 
the TCB's functional properties, the product's operational 
support guidance, and other producer's documentation as 
defined by the development evidence requirements. Functional 
test analysis is based on the achieved test results as 
compared to the expected results derived from the development 
evidence.

For CS3, TA-2 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 TA-2: Enhanced Test Analysis

The evaluator shall assess whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for functional testing and 
penetration analysis, and whether the producer has 
documented these activities as defined in the 
development evidence requirements of the 
protection profile. The evaluator shall analyze 
the results of the producer's testing activities 
for completeness of coverage and consistency of 
results, and general correctness (e.g., defect 
trend from regression testing). This analysis 
shall examine the testability of requirements, the 
adequacy of the tests to measure the required 
properties, the deviation of the actual results 
obtained from the expected results, and a general 
interpretation of what the testing results mean. 
The evaluator shall determine whether the 
product's protection properties, as described in 
the product documentation, and all relevant known 
penetration flaws have been tested. The evaluator 
shall assess testing results to determine whether 
the product's TCB works as claimed, and whether 
there are any remaining obvious ways (i.e., ways 
that are known, or that are readily apparent or 
easily discovered in product documentation) for an 
unauthorized user to bypass the policy implemented 
by the TCB or otherwise defeat the product's TCB.

4.18	Independent Testing 

Independent testing determines whether the product's TCB 
meets the functional protection requirements as defined in the 
functionality chapter of this Protection Profile. Testing is 
based on operational product, the TCB's functional 
properties, the product's operational support guidance, and 
other producer's documentation as defined by the Development 
Evidence requirements.

For CS3, IT-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 IT-1: Elementary Independent Testing

A tester, independent of the producer or 
evaluator, shall perform functional and elementary 
penetration testing. This testing shall be based 
on the product's user and administrative 
documentation, and on relevant known penetration 
flaws. Satisfactory completion consists of 
demonstrating that all user-visible security 
enforcing functions and security-relevant 
functions work as described in the product's user 
and administrative documentation and that no 
discrepancies exist between the documentation and 
the product. Test results of the producer shall be 
confirmed by the results of independent testing. 
The evaluator may selectively reconfirm any test 
result.

If the independent testing is performed at beta-
test sites, the producer shall supply the beta-
test plan and the test results. The evaluator 
shall review the scope and depth of beta testing 
with respect to the required protection 
functionality, and shall verify independence of 
both the test sites and the producer's and beta-
test user's test results. The evaluator shall 
confirm that the test environment of the beta-test 
site(s) adequately represents the environment 
specified in the protection profile.

4.19	Development Environment Review

Development environment review determines whether the 
product meets the requirements as defined in the protection 
profile's Development Assurance subsections for Development 
Environment including Life-Cycle Definition and Configuration 
Management.

For CS3, DER-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 DER-1: Elementary Development Environment Review 

The evaluator shall review the producer's 
development and maintenance process description 
documentation to determine the degree of 
discipline enforced upon and within the process, 
and to determine the protection characteristics 
associated with the product's development and 
maintenance. The results of this review shall 
establish, for the evaluator, the producer's 
development environment, its policies, and the 
degree of enforcement maintained during 
development execution.

4.20	Operational Support Review

Operation support review establishes the level of review 
required to determine whether the product meets the 
requirements as defined in the protection profile's 
Development Assurance subsections for Operational Support 
including, at the CS3 level, the User and Administrative 
Guidance documents.

For CS3, OSR-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 OSR-1 Elementary Operational Support Review

The evaluator shall review all documentation 
focused on the activities of product use (e.g., 
Users Manuals) and product administration 
including installation, operation, maintenance, 
and trusted recovery (e.g., Trusted Facility 
Management Manuals). This review shall assess the 
clarity of presentation, difficulty in locating 
topics of interest, ease of understanding, and 
completeness of coverage. The need for separate 
manuals dedicated to protection-relevant aspects 
of the product should be assessed for 
effectiveness.

This component should also address flaw 
remediation and trusted generation. [[TBD.]]

4.21	Design Analysis

Design analysis determines whether the product meets the 
design requirements as defined in the Development Process 
Assurance section of the protection profile, including the TCB 
Property Definition and TCB Design requirements. The analysis 
is based on the producer's documentation, as defined by the 
Development Evidence requirements.

For CS3, DA-1 was assigned from the Federal Criteria. No 
refinements were made from the Federal Criteria.

 DA-1: Elementary Design Analysis

The evaluator shall determine whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development process assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for TCB property definition and 
TCB design. The evaluator shall determine whether 
the producer has documented these activities as 
defined in the development evidence requirements 
of the protection profile. The evaluator shall 
analyze the results of the producer's activities 
for completeness and consistency of design with 
respect to requirements.

LABEL-BASED PROTECTION - 1 (LP-1)

This Protection Profile has been developed to define a set of 
technical measures that can be incorporated into remote-
access, resource- and information-sharing Information 
Technology (IT) products that will be used to protect two or 
more compartments of National Security Information classified 
according to US Executive Order 12356 (EO 12356). This profile 
can also be used to protect any information that has been 
designated as sensitive information for which information 
separation and access are based on sensitivity markings 
applied to the information.

Compliant IT products will provide protection for a 
compartmented information processing environment with which 
an organization can construct an automated information system 
to enhance or optimize the organization's ability to perform 
its mission.

In LP-1 conformant systems, the TCB is based on a multi-level 
security policy model for confidentiality that requires both 
discretionary and non-discretionary access controls. In 
relation to lower levels of protection functionality, LP-1 
conformat systems have the following additional features.

a.	Access control enforcement includes a defined subset 
of subjects and objects in the ADP system. 

b.	An informal statement of the security policy model, 
data labeling, and mandatory access control over named 
subjects and objects is included.

c.	The supported labels accurately represent the 
sensitivity of objects and subjects, and are 
maintained on exported objects. 

d.	Any flaws identified by testing are removed or 
neutralized.

RATIONALE

1.	Information Protection Policy

 It is anticipated that organizations wishing to process 
compartmented-mode classified information will want to use IT 
products that are compliant with this profile in their 
automated information processing systems. These organizations 
should be able to trust the profile-compliant IT product to 
contribute to the protection of the compartmented information 
at least as much as they trust the properly cleared personnel 
who are using and managing the system.

2.	Protection Philosophy

This profile presumes an environment providing control of 
access to shared resources both (1) on the basis of attributes 
that are controlled by the ordinary users of the system and 
(2) on the basis of attributes that are controlled only by the 
system administrators.

Profile compliant IT products will minimally meet the 
following objectives:

a.	Enforce an informally defined security policy that 
describes the rules for accessing and administering 
access controls.

b.	Associate explicit sensitivity labels with a defined 
subset of the system entities. Associate explicit 
sensitivity labels with each port through which 
information may be exported from or imported to the 
system. Maintain the accuracy of the access control 
labels as information moves within the system and 
through the ports.

c.	Authenticate the claimed identity of each external 
human user of the IT product prior to establishing any 
internal entity to act on behalf of that user and 
firmly bind the authenticated user identity to the 
internal entity.

d.	Selectively keep and protect a log of all actions or 
events that could affect system security so that they 
can be accurately attributed to the known user or 
system entity responsible for causing the action or 
event.

3.	Expected Threats

The requirements for profile conforming IT products assume 
that these products are being used in an environment where 
there are multiple categories of classified data and users. A 
conforming IT product can be expected to protect the 
confidentiality of information in an environment where there 
are two or more levels of classified data and two or more 
levels of cleared users, but where malicious applications 
programs (e.g., Trojan Horses) and users are not present.

4.	Assumed Environment

4.1	Characteristics

IT products complying with the requirements set forth in this 
profile are expected to be used in an environment with the 
following characteristics:

a.	Multiple users will be accessing the operating system 
at the same time.

b.	The IT product hardware base (e.g., CPU, printers, 
terminals, etc.) is protected from unauthorized 
physical access.

c.	One or more administrators are assigned to manage the 
system in which the IT product is incorporated, 
including the security of the information it contains.

d.	A need to control user access to objects exists and is 
based on an explicit sensitivity marking associated 
with the information (e.g, Confidential, Secret or Top 
Secret) and on that user's identity and membership in 
organizations or groups.

e.	The IT product provides facilities for some or all of 
the authorized users to create programs that use the 
applications programming interface (API) and make 
those programs available to other users.

f.	The IT product is used to provide a cooperative 
environment for the users to accomplish some task or 
group of tasks.

4.2	Environment Dependencies

Secure installation and operation of a product satisfying 
these profile requirements depends on provision of a number 
of elements in the installation environment. These include:

a.	Physical security must be provided. 

b.	Cabling to other devices must be shown to be 
consistent with policy implemented by the product. For 
example, a "port" in the product is required to have 
an assigned label. No device can be connected to the 
port unless it has been established externally that 
the device is allowed to receive data with the same 
label.

c.	Personnel allowed to access data processed by the 
installed product must already be authorized for such 
access.

5.	Intended Use

Conforming IT products are useful in both general-purpose 
office automation environments with multiple data 
sensitivities and in specialized computing, network and 
mission environments. Examples of the office automation 
environment might include military headquarters and highly 
competitive procurement offices. An example of the 
specialized mission environment might be as a platform for a 
portable battlefield map and mission management application.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

I&A-2 Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

1.	The TCB shall require users to identify 
themselves to it before beginning to perform any 
other actions that the TCB is expected to mediate. 
The TCB shall be able to enforce individual 
accountability by providing the capability to 
uniquely identify each individual user. The TCB 
shall also provide the capability of associating 
this identity with all auditable actions taken by 
that individual.

2. 	The TCB shall maintain authentication data that 
includes information for verifying the identity of 
individual users (e.g., passwords) as well as 
information for determining the clearance and 
authorization of individual users. These data 
shall be used by the TCB to authenticate the 
user's identity and to ensure that the subject 
security level and authorizations of subjects 
external to the TCB that may be created to act on 
behalf of the individual user are dominated by the 
clearance and authorization of that user).

3. 	The TCB shall protect authentication data so 
that it cannot be used by any unauthorized user. 

AD-1 - Minimal Audit

1.	The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and 
protect from modification or unauthorized access 
or destruction an audit trail of accesses to the 
objects it protects. The audit data shall be 
protected by the TCB so that read access to it is 
limited to those who are authorized for audit 
data.

2.	The TCB shall be able to record the following 
types of events:

	- use of the identification and authentication 
mechanisms;

	- introduction of objects into a user's address 
space (e.g., file open, program initiation), and 
deletion of objects;

	- actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators and/or system security officers.

The TCB shall be able to record any override of 
human-readable output markings.

3.	For each recorded event, the audit record shall 
identify: date and time of the event, user, type 
of event, and success or failure of the event. For 
identification/authentication events the origin of 
request (e.g., terminal ID) shall be included in 
the audit record. For events that introduce an 
object into a user's address space and for object 
deletion events the audit record shall include the 
name and the object security level.

4.	The system administrator shall be able to 
selectively audit the actions of one or more users 
based on individual identity and/or object 
security level.

AC-2 Basic Access Control

1.	Definition of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and protect access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. Subject 
attributes shall include named individuals or 
defined groups or both. Object attributes shall 
include defined access rights (e.g., read, write, 
execute) that can be assigned to subject 
attributes. Access control attributes 
corresponding to each individual policy shall be 
identified.

Sensitivity labels associated with each subject 
and object shall be maintained by the TCB. The 
sensitivity labels shall be used as the basis for 
mandatory access control decisions.

The subjects and objects shall be assigned 
sensitivity labels that are a combination of 
hierarchical classification levels and non-
hierarchical categories, and the labels shall be 
used as the basis for mandatory access control 
decisions. The TCB shall be able to support two or 
more such security levels.

The subject and object attributes shall accurately 
reflect the sensitivity and integrity of the 
subject or object. When exported by the TCB, 
sensitivity labels shall accurately and 
unambiguously represent the internal labels and 
shall be associated with the information being 
exported.

2.	Administration of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and enforce rules for 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. The effect of 
these rules shall be that access permission to an 
object by users not already possessing access 
permission is assigned only by authorized users. 
These rules shall allow authorized users to 
specify and control sharing of objects by named 
individuals or defined groups of individuals, or 
by both, and shall provide controls to limit 
propagation of access rights. These controls shall 
be capable of including or excluding access to the 
granularity of a single user.

The rules for assignment and modification of 
access control attributes shall include those for 
attribute assignment to objects during import and 
export operations. 

Export of Labeled Information

	The TCB shall designate each communication 
channel and I/O device as either single-level or 
multilevel. Any change in this designation shall 
be done manually and shall be auditable by the 
TCB. The TCB shall maintain and be able to audit 
any change in the security level or levels 
associated with a communication channel or I/O 
device.

	1. Exportation to Multilevel Devices

	When the TCB exports an object to a multilevel 
I/O device, the sensitivity label associated with 
that object shall also be exported and shall 
reside on the same physical medium as the exported 
information and shall be in the same form (i.e., 
machine-readable or human-readable form). When the 
TCB exports or imports an object over a multilevel 
communication channel, the protocol used on that 
channel shall provide for the unambiguous pairing 
between the sensitivity labels and the associated 
information that is sent or received.

	2. Exportation to Single-Level Devices

	Single-level I/O devices and single-level 
communication channels are not required to 
maintain the sensitivity labels of the information 
they process. However, the TCB shall include a 
mechanism by which the TCB and an authorized user 
reliably communicate to designate the single 
security level of information imported or exported 
via single-level communication channels or I/O 
devices.

	3. Labeling Human-Readable Output

	The system administrator shall be able to 
specify the printable label names associated with 
exported sensitivity labels. The TCB shall mark 
the beginning and end of all human-readable, 
paged, hardcopy output (e.g., line printer output) 
with human-readable sensitivity labels that 
properly represent the sensitivity of the output. 
The TCB shall, by default, mark the top and bottom 
of each page of human-readable, paged, hardcopy 
output (e.g., line printer output) with human-
readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the overall sensitivity of the output or 
that properly represent the sensitivity of the 
information on the page. The TCB shall, by default 
and in an appropriate manner, mark other forms of 
human-readable output (e.g., maps, graphics) with 
human-readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the sensitivity of the output. Any 
override of these marking defaults shall be 
auditable by the TCB.

Import of Non-labeled Data

	In order to import non-labeled data, the TCB 
shall request and receive from an authorized user 
the security level of the data, and all such 
actions shall be auditable by the TCB.

If different rules of assignment and modification 
of access control attributes apply to different 
subjects and/or objects, the totality of these 
rules shall be shown to support the defined 
policy.

3.	Authorization of Subject References to Objects

The TCB shall define and enforce authorization 
rules for the mediation of subject references to 
objects. These rules shall be based on the access 
control attributes of subjects and objects. These 
rules shall, either by explicit user action or by 
default, provide that objects are protected from 
unauthorized access. 

The authorization rules for the mandatory access 
control policy shall include:

	The TCB shall enforce a mandatory access control 
policy over all subjects and storage objects under 
its control (e.g., processes, files, segments, 
devices). The following requirements shall hold 
for all accesses between all subjects and objects 
controlled by the TCB: A subject can read an 
object only if the hierarchical classification in 
the subject's security level is greater than or 
equal to the hierarchical classification in the 
object's security level and the non- hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level include 
all the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level. A subject can write an 
object only if the hierarchical classification in 
the subject's security level is less than or equal 
to the hierarchical classification in the object's 
security level and all the non-hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level are 
included in the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level.

The scope of the authorization rules shall include 
a defined subset of the product's subjects and 
objects and associated access control attributes. 
The coverage of authorization rules shall specify 
the types of objects and subjects to which these 
rules apply. If different rules apply to different 
subjects and objects, the totality of these rules 
shall be shown to support the defined policy. 

The authorization rules for each policy shall be 
defined separately. The TCB shall define and 
enforce the composition of policies, including the 
enforcement of the authorization rules (e.g., 
subject and object type coverage, enforcement 
precedence).

4. Subject and Object Creation and Destruction

The TCB shall control the creation and destruction 
of subjects and objects. These controls shall 
include object reuse. That is, all authorizations 
to the information contained within a storage 
object shall be revoked prior to initial 
assignment, allocation or reallocation to a 
subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage 
objects; information, including encrypted 
representations of information, produced by a 
prior subjects' actions shall be unavailable to 
any subject that obtains access to an object that 
has been released back to the system.

RM-1 Mediation of References to a Defined Subject/Object 
Subset

1. 	The TCB shall mediate all references to 
subjects, objects, resources, and services (e.g., 
TCB functions) described in the TCB 
specifications. The mediation shall ensure that 
all references are directed to the appropriate 
security-policy functions.

2.	Reference mediation shall include references to 
the defined subset of subjects, objects, and 
resources protected under the TCB security policy, 
and to their policy attributes (i.e., access 
rights, security levels).

3. 	References issued by privileged subjects shall 
be mediated in accordance with the policy 
attributes defined for those subjects.

P-1 Basic TCB Isolation

The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own 
execution that protects it from external 
interference and tampering (e.g., by reading or 
modification of its code and data structures). The 
protection of the TCB shall provide TCB isolation 
and noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions as follows:

	1. TCB Isolation requires that (1) the address 
spaces of the TCB and those of unprivileged 
subjects are separated such that users, or 
unprivileged subjects operating on their behalf, 
cannot read or modify TCB data structures or code, 
(2) the transfers between TCB and non-TCB domains 
are controlled such that arbitrary entry to or 
return from the TCB are not possible; and (3) the 
user or application parameters passed to the TCB 
by addresses are validated with respect to the TCB 
address space, and those passed by value are 
validated with respect to the values expected by 
the TCB.

	2. Noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions requires that the permission to objects 
(and/or to non-TCB data) passed as parameters to 
the TCB are validated with respect to the 
permissions required by the TCB, and references to 
TCB objects implementing TCB isolation functions 
are mediated by the TCB.

SC-1 Minimal Self Checking

Hardware and/or software features shall be 
provided that can be used to periodically validate 
the correct operation of the on-site hardware and 
firmware elements of the TCB.

ASSURANCES 

Requirements for TCB Property Definition

PD-2 Informal Property Identification

The developer shall provide informal models for 
the functional components and sub-components of 
the profile. At a minimum, an informal model of 
the access control components shall be provided.

structures and operations defining each functional 
component or sub-component, and a description of 
the model properties. The developer shall 
interpret (e.g., trace) the informal models within 
the product TCB. For each model entity, the 
developer shall: (1) identify the TCB elements and 
their TCB interfaces (if any) that implement that 
entity; (2) define the operation of these TCB 
elements, and (3) explain why the operation of 
these elements is consistent with the model 
properties. The developer's interpretation of each 
informal model, which defines the TCB properties, 
shall identify all TCB elements that do not 
correspond to any model entity and shall explain 
why these elements do not render the TCB 
properties invalid.

For the components that are not informally 
modeled, the developer shall interpret the 
functional requirements of the protection profile 
within the product TCB. For each functional 
requirement, the developer shall: (1) identify the 
TCB elements and their TCB interfaces (if any) 
that implement that requirement; (2) describe the 
operation of these TCB elements, and (3) explain 
why the operation of these elements is consistent 
with the functional requirement. The developer's 
interpretation of each functional requirement, 
which describes the TCB properties, shall identify 
all TCB elements that do not correspond to any 
functional requirement and shall explain why these 
elements do not render the TCB properties invalid.

Requirements for TCB Element Identification

ID-2: TCB Element Justification

The developer shall identify the TCB elements 
(i.e., software, hardware/firmware code and data 
structures). Each element must be unambiguously 
identified by its name, type, release, and version 
number (if any).

The developer shall justify the protection 
relevance of the identified elements (i.e., only 
elements that can affect the correct operation of 
the protection functions shall be included in the 
TCB).

Requirements for TCB Interface Definition

UG-1: Users' Guide

The developer shall provide a User Guide which 
describes all protection services provided and 
enforced by the TCB. The User Guide shall describe 
the interaction between these services and provide 
examples of their use. The User Guide may be in the 
form of a summary, chapter or manual. The User 
Guide shall specifically describe user 
responsibilities. These shall encompass any user 
responsibilities identified in the protection 
profile.

Requirements for Administrative Guidance

AG-1: Basic Administrative Guidance

The developer shall provide a Trusted Facility 
Manual intended for the product administrators 
that describes how to use the TCB security 
services (e.g., Access Control, System Entry, or 
Audit) to enforce a system security policy. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall include the 
procedures for securely configuring, starting, 
maintaining, and halting the TCB. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall explain how to analyze audit 
data generated by the TCB to identify and document 
user and administrator violations of this policy. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain the 
privileges and functions of administrators. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall describe the 
administrative interaction between security 
services.

The Trusted Facility Manual shall be distinct from 
User Guidance, and encompass any administrative 
responsibilities identified in security 
management.



Requirements for Trusted Generation

TG-1: Basic Trusted Generation

The developer shall establish and document the 
procedures that a consumer must perform to 
generate an operational TCB from the delivered 
copy of the master TCB. The consumer documentation 
shall identify any system parameters, which are 
initialized or set during system generation, that 
affect the TCB's conformance to the protection 
profile and state the acceptable ranges of values 
for those parameters.

Requirements for Evidence of TCB Protection Properties

EPP-2 Evidence of Informal Model Interpretation in the TCB

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. The developer shall also

established by the developer to satisfy the 
Operational Support and Development Environment 
requirements of the protection profile. 

Requirements for Test Analysis

TA-1: ElementaryTest Analysis

The evaluator shall assess whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for functional testing and 
whether the producer has documented these 
activities as defined in the development evidence 
requirements of the protection profile. The 
evaluator shall analyze the results of the 
producer's testing activities for completeness of 
coverage and consistency of results. The evaluator 
shall determine whether the product's protection 
properties, as described in the product 
documentation have been tested. The evaluator 
shall assess testing results to determine whether 
the product's TCB works as claimed.



Requirements for Independent Testing

T-1: Elementary Independent Testing

A tester, independent of the producer or 
evaluator, shall perform functional and elementary 
penetration testing. This testing shall be based 
on the product's user and administrative 
documentation, and on relevant known penetration 
flaws. Satisfactory completion consists of 
demonstrating that all user-visible security 
enforcing functions and security-relevant 
functions work as described in the product's user 
and administrative documentation and that no 
discrepancies exist between the documentation and 
the product. Test results of the producer shall be 
confirmed by the results of independent testing. 
The evaluator may selectively reconfirm any test 
result.

If the independent testing is performed at beta-
test sites, the producer shall supply the beta-
test plan and the test results. The evaluator 
shall review the scope and depth of beta testing 
with respect to the required protection 
functionality, and shall verify independence of 
both the test sites and the producer's and beta-
test user's test results. The evaluator shall 
confirm that the test environment of the beta-test 
site(s) adequately represents the environment 
specified in the protection profile.

Requirements for Operational Support Review

OSR-1 Elementary Operational Support Review

The evaluator shall review all documentation 
focused on the activities of product use (e.g., 
Users Manuals) and product administration 
including installation, operation, maintenance, 
and trusted recovery (e.g., Trusted Facility 
Management Manuals). This review shall assess the 
clarity of presentation, difficulty in locating 
topics of interest, ease of understanding, and 
completeness of coverage. The need for separate 
manuals dedicated to protection-relevant aspects 
of the product should be assessed for 
effectiveness.

LABEL-BASED PROTECTION - 2 (LP-2)

 This Protection Profile has been developed to define a set 
of technical measures that can be incorporated into remote-
access, resource- and information-sharing Information 
Technology (IT) products that will be used to protect up to 
three levels or more than two categories of National Security 
Information classified according to US Executive Order 12356 
(EO 12356). This profile can also be used to protect any 
information that has been designated as sensitive information 
for which information separation and access are based on 
sensitivity markings applied to the information.

Compliant IT products will provide structured protection 
for a multi-level information processing environment with 
which an organization can construct an automated information 
system to enhance or optimize the organization's ability to 
perform its mission.

In LP-2 conformant systems, the TCB is based on a clearly 
defined and documented formal security policy model for 
confidentiality that requires both discretionary and non-
discretionary access controls. Also, The TCB is relatively 
resistant to penetration. In relation to lower levels of 
protection functionality, LP-2 conformat systems have the 
following additional features.

a.	Access control enforcement is extended to all subjects 
and objects in the ADP system. 

b.	Covert storage channels are identified and handled.

c.	The TCB is modularized and carefully structured into 
protection-critical and non-protection-critical. 

d.	The TCB interface is well-defined and the TCB design 
and implementation enables it to be subjected to 
thorough testing and review. Penetration testing is 
also performed, and the TCB must be found relatively 
resistant to penetration.

e.	Authentication mechanisms cover all policy attributes 
of a user (e.g., groups, secrecy and/or integrity 
levels, roles), not just the individual identity. 

f.	Security management is enhanced by the separation of 
system administrator and operator functions. 

g.	Configuration management controls are imposed.

RATIONALE

6.	Information Protection Policy

 It is anticipated that organizations wishing to process 
either one level with three or more categories or one to three 
levels with one category of classified information will want 
to use IT products that are compliant with this profile in 
their automated information processing systems. These 
organizations should be able to trust the profile-compliant 
IT product to contribute to the protection of the classified 
information at least as much as they trust the properly 
cleared personnel who are using and managing the system.

7.	Protection Philosophy

This profile presumes a hostile environment with divided, 
aggressive users. It provides control of access to shared 
resources both (1) on the basis of attributes that are 
controlled by the ordinary users of the system and (2) on the 
basis of attributes that are controlled only by the system 
administrators.

Profile compliant IT products will minimally meet the 
following objectives:

a.	Enforce a formally defined security policy that 
describes the rules for controlling access to system 
subjects and objects. Use the access control rules to 
enforce an information flow policy that aims to 
control the use of covert storage channels.

b.	Associate explicit sensitivity labels with each 
subject and object in the system. Associate explicit 
sensitivity labels with each port through which 
information may be exported from or imported to the 
system. Maintain the accuracy of the sensitivity 
labels as information moves within the system and 
through the ports.

c.	Authenticate the claimed identity of each external 
human user of the IT product prior to establishing any 
internal entity to act on behalf of that user and 
firmly bind the authenticated user identity to the 
internal entity.

d.	Selectively keep and protect a log of all actions or 
events (including use of covert storage channels) that 
could affect system security so that they can be 
accurately attributed to the known user or system 
entity responsible for causing the action or event.

e.	Contains hardware and software mechanisms that can be 
independently evaluated to provide sufficient 
assurance that the system satisfies the previous four 
objectives.

f.	Implements the enforcement of objectives in such a 
fashion that the enforcing mechanisms are protected 
from tampering and unauthorized changes by the 
entities these mechanisms are supposed to control.

8.	Expected Threats

The requirements for profile conforming IT products assume 
that these products are being used in an environment where 
there are different levels or categories of classified data 
and users of differing clearance levels. A conforming IT 
product can be expected to protect the confidentiality of 
information in an environment where there are two levels or 
categories of classified data and two or more levels of 
cleared users and where there are collaborating, malicious 
users and software at each clearance level.

9.	Assumed Environment

9.1	Characteristics

IT products complying with the requirements set forth in 
this profile are expected to be used in an environment with 
the following characteristics:

a.	Multiple users will be accessing the operating system 
at the same time.

b.	The IT product hardware base (e.g., CPU, printers, 
terminals, etc.) is protected from unauthorized 
physical access.

c.	One or more administrators are assigned to manage the 
system in which the IT product is incorporated, 
including the security of the information it contains.

d.	A need to control user access to information exists 
and is based on an explicit sensitivity marking 
associated with the information (e.g, Secret or Top 
Secret).

e.	A need to control user access to all subjects and 
objects exists and is based on that user's identity 
and membership in organizations or groups.

f.	The IT product provides facilities for some or all of 
the authorized users to create programs that use the 
applications programming interface (API) and make 
those programs available to other users.

g.	The IT product is used to provide a cooperative 
environment for the users to accomplish some task or 
group of tasks.

9.2	Environment Dependencies

Secure installation and operation of a product satisfying 
these profile requirements depends on provision of a number 
of elements in the installation environment. These include:

a.	Physical security must be provided. 

b.	Cabling to other devices must be shown to be 
consistent with policy implemented by the product. For 
example, a "port" in the product is required to have 
an assigned label. No device can be connected to the 
port unless it has been established externally that 
the device is allowed to receive data with the same 
label.

c.	Personnel allowed to access data processed by the 
installed product must already be authorized for such 
access.

10.	Intended Use

Conforming IT products are useful in both general-purpose 
office automation environments with multiple data 
sensitivities (or "classifications") and multiple levels of 
user authorizations (or "clearances") and in specialized 
computing, network and mission environments. Examples of the 
office automation environment might include military 
headquarters and highly competitive procurement offices. 
Examples of the network environments include use as the basis 
for a multilevel secure network management center or a trusted 
guard gateway operating between two networks processing 
different levels of information. An example of the specialized 
mission environment might be as a platform for a portable 
battlefield map and mission management application.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

I&A-2 Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

1.	The TCB shall require users to identify 
themselves to it before beginning to perform any 
other actions that the TCB is expected to mediate. 
The TCB shall be able to enforce individual 
accountability by providing the capability to 
uniquely identify each individual user. The TCB 
shall also provide the capability of associating 
this identity with all auditable actions taken by 
that individual.

2. 	The TCB shall maintain authentication data that 
includes information for verifying the identity of 
individual users (e.g., passwords) as well as 
information for determining the clearance and 
authorization of individual users. These data 
shall be used by the TCB to authenticate the 
user's identity and to ensure that the subject 
security level and authorizations of subjects 
external to the TCB that may be created to act on 
behalf of the individual user are dominated by the 
clearance and authorization of that user).

3. 	The TCB shall protect authentication data so 
that it cannot be used by any unauthorized user. 

TP-1 Login Trusted Path

The TCB shall support a trusted communication path 
between itself and the user for initial 
identification and authentication. Communications 
via this path shall be initiated exclusively by a 
user.

AD-1 - Minimal Audit

1.	The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and 
protect from modification or unauthorized access 
or destruction an audit trail of accesses to the 
objects it protects. The audit data shall be 
protected by the TCB so that read access to it is 
limited to those who are authorized for audit 
data.

2.	The TCB shall be able to record the following 
types of events:

	- use of the identification and authentication 
mechanisms;

	- introduction of objects into a user's address 
space (e.g., file open, program initiation), and 
deletion of objects;

	- actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators and/or system security officers.

The TCB shall be able to record any override of 
human-readable output markings. The TCB shall also 
be able to audit the identified event that may be 
used in the exploitation of covert channels.

3.	For each recorded event, the audit record shall 
identify: date and time of the event, user, type 
of event, and success or failure of the event. For 
identification/authentication events the origin of 
request (e.g., terminal ID) shall be included in 
the audit record. For events that introduce an 
object into a user's address space and for object 
deletion events the audit record shall include the 
name and the object security level.

4.	The system administrator shall be able to 
selectively audit the actions of one or more users 
based on individual identity and/or object 
security level.

AC-3 Extended Access Control

1.	Definition of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and protect access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. Subject 
attributes shall include named individuals or 
defined groups or both. Object attributes shall 
include defined access rights (e.g., read, write, 
execute) that can be assigned to subject 
attributes. Access control attributes 
corresponding to each individual policy shall be 
identified.

Sensitivity labels associated with each subject 
and storage object that is directly or indirectly 
accessible by subjects external to the TCB shall 
be maintained by the TCB. The sensitivity labels 
shall be used as the basis for mandatory access 
control decisions.

The subjects and objects shall be assigned 
sensitivity labels that are a combination of 
hierarchical classification levels and non-
hierarchical categories, and the labels shall be 
used as the basis for mandatory access control 
decisions. The TCB shall be able to support two or 
more such security levels.

The subject and object attributes shall accurately 
reflect the sensitivity and integrity of the 
subject or object. When exported by the TCB, 
sensitivity labels shall accurately and 
unambiguously represent the internal labels and 
shall be associated with the information being 
exported.

The TCB shall immediately notify a terminal user 
of each change in the security level associated 
with that user during an interactive session. A 
terminal user shall be able to query the TCB as 
desired for a display of the subject's complete 
sensitivity label. 

The TCB shall support the assignment of minimum 
and maximum security levels to all attached 
physical devices. These security levels shall be 
used by the TCB to enforce constraints imposed by 
the physical environments in which the devices are 
located.

2.	Administration of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and enforce rules for 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. The effect of 
these rules shall be that access permission to an 
object by users not already possessing access 
permission is assigned only by authorized users. 
These rules shall allow authorized users to 
specify and control sharing of objects by named 
individuals or defined groups of individuals, or 
by both, and shall provide controls to limit 
propagation of access rights. These controls shall 
be capable of including or excluding access to the 
granularity of a single user.

The rules for assignment and modification of 
access control attributes shall include those for 
attribute assignment to objects during import and 
export operations. 

Export of Labeled Information

	The TCB shall designate each communication 
channel and I/O device as either single-level or 
multilevel. Any change in this designation shall 
be done manually and shall be auditable by the 
TCB. The TCB shall maintain and be able to audit 
any change in the security level or levels 
associated with a communication channel or I/O 
device.

	1. Exportation to Multilevel Devices

	When the TCB exports an object to a multilevel 
I/O device, the sensitivity label associated with 
that object shall also be exported and shall 
reside on the same physical medium as the exported 
information and shall be in the same form (i.e., 
machine-readable or human-readable form). When the 
TCB exports or imports an object over a multilevel 
communication channel, the protocol used on that 
channel shall provide for the unambiguous pairing 
between the sensitivity labels and the associated 
information that is sent or received.

	2. Exportation to Single-Level Devices

	Single-level I/O devices and single-level 
communication channels are not required to 
maintain the sensitivity labels of the information 
they process. However, the TCB shall include a 
mechanism by which the TCB and an authorized user 
reliably communicate to designate the single 
security level of information imported or exported 
via single-level communication channels or I/O 
devices.

	3. Labeling Human-Readable Output

	The system administrator shall be able to 
specify the printable label names associated with 
exported sensitivity labels. The TCB shall mark 
the beginning and end of all human-readable, 
paged, hardcopy output (e.g., line printer output) 
with human-readable sensitivity labels that 
properly represent the sensitivity of the output. 
The TCB shall, by default, mark the top and bottom 
of each page of human-readable, paged, hardcopy 
output (e.g., line printer output) with human-
readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the overall sensitivity of the output or 
that properly represent the sensitivity of the 
information on the page. The TCB shall, by default 
and in an appropriate manner, mark other forms of 
human-readable output (e.g., maps, graphics) with 
human-readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the sensitivity of the output. Any 
override of these marking defaults shall be 
auditable by the TCB.

Import of Non-labeled Data

	In order to import non-labeled data, the TCB 
shall request and receive from an authorized user 
the security level of the data, and all such 
actions shall be auditable by the TCB.

If different rules of assignment and modification 
of access control attributes apply to different 
subjects and/or objects, the totality of these 
rules shall be shown to support the defined 
policy.

3.	Authorization of Subject References to Objects

The TCB shall define and enforce authorization 
rules for the mediation of subject references to 
objects. These rules shall be based on the access 
control attributes of subjects and objects. These 
rules shall, either by explicit user action or by 
default, provide that objects are protected from 
unauthorized access. 

The scope of the authorization rules shall include 
all subjects, storage objects (e.g., processes, 
segments, devices) and associated access control 
attributes that are directly or indirectly 
accessible to subjects external to the TCB. The 
scope of the authorization rules shall also 
include all policy and status attributes of 
subjects and storage objects (e.g., quotas, object 
existence, size, access time, creation and 
modification time, locked/unlocked). If different 
rules apply to different subjects and objects, the 
totality of these rules shall be shown to support 
the defined policy. 

The authorization rules for the mandatory access 
control policy shall include:

	The TCB shall enforce a mandatory access control 
policy over all resources (i.e., subjects, storage 
objects, and I/O devices that are directly or 
indirectly accessible by subjects external to the 
TCB. The following requirements shall hold for all 
accesses between all subjects external to the TCB 
and all objects directly or indirectly accessible 
by these subjects: A subject can read an object 
only if the hierarchical classification in the 
subject's security level is greater than or equal 
to the hierarchical classification in the object's 
security level and the non- hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level include 
all the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level. A subject can write an 
object only if the hierarchical classification in 
the subject's security level is less than or equal 
to the hierarchical classification in the object's 
security level and all the non-hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level are 
included in the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level.

The authorization rules for each policy shall be 
defined separately. The TCB shall define and 
enforce the composition of policies, including the 
enforcement of the authorization rules (e.g., 
subject and object type coverage, enforcement 
precedence).

4. Subject and Object Creation and Destruction

The TCB shall control the creation and destruction 
of subjects and objects. These controls shall 
include object reuse. That is, all authorizations 
to the information contained within a storage 
object shall be revoked prior to initial 
assignment, allocation or reallocation to a 
subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage 
objects; information, including encrypted 
representations of information, produced by a 
prior subjects' actions shall be unavailable to 
any subject that obtains access to an object that 
has been released back to the system.

CCH-2 Storage Channel Audit and Bandwidth Limitation

1. 	The TCB and privileged applications shall 
include functions that help audit the use of 
covert storage channels. These functions shall 
enable the identification of the transmitter, 
receiver, and specific covert channels used (e.g., 
TCB and privileged application element used to 
transmit information). TCB functions that help 
limit the bandwidth and/or eliminate covert 
storage channels shall also be provided. The 
bandwidth limits for each channel shall be 
settable by system administrators.

2. 	The functions added to the TCB and privileged 
applications for storage channel auditing shall be 
identified for each channel and shall be available 
in common product configurations. If audit 
functions are not added to certain storage 
channels (e.g., hardware storage channels), 
evidence must be provided to justify why these 
channels do not represent a security threat for 
the intended use of the product. TCB and 
privileged application functions that help limit 
the bandwidth and/or eliminate covert storage 
channels shall also be available in common product 
configurations.

If channel bandwidth limitation and channel 
elimination functions are not added to certain 
storage channels (e.g., hardware storage 
channels), evidence must be provided to justify 
why these channels do not represent a security 
threat for the intended use of the product.

SM-1 Minimal Security Management

1. 	The TCB shall provide an installation mechanism 
for the setting and updating of its configuration 
parameters, and for the initialization of its 
protection-relevant data structures before any 
user or administrator policy attributes are 
defined. It shall allow the configuration of TCB 
internal databases and tables.

2. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
displaying and modifying the security policy 
parameters. 

3. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
manually displaying, modifying, or deleting user 
registration and account parameters. These 
parameters shall include unique user identifiers, 
their account, and their associated user name and 
affiliation. The TCB shall allow the manual 
enabling and disabling of user identities and/or 
accounts.

4. 	The TCB shall support separate operator and 
administrator functions. The operator functions 
shall be restricted to those necessary for 
performing routine operations. The operator 
functions shall allow the enabling and disabling 
of peripheral devices, mounting removable storage 
media, backing-up and recovering user objects; 
maintaining the TCB hardware and software elements 
(e.g., on-site testing); and starting and shutting 
down the system. [SM-3]

5. 	 The use of the protected mechanisms for system 
administration shall be limited to authorized 
administrative users.

RM-3 Mediation of References to Subject and Object 
Attributes

1. 	The TCB shall mediate all references to 
subjects, objects, resources, and services (e.g., 
TCB functions) described in the TCB 
specifications. The mediation shall ensure that 
all references are directed to the appropriate 
security-policy functions.

2. 	 Reference mediation shall include control of 
references to all subjects, objects, and resources 
protected under the TCB security policy, to their 
policy (i.e., access rights, security levels) and 
status attributes (e.g., existence, length, 
locking state).

3. 	References issued by privileged subjects shall 
be mediated in accordance with the policy 
attributes defined for those subjects.

P-2 TCB Isolation and Consistency

The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own 
execution that protects it from external 
interference and tampering (e.g., by reading or 
modification of its code and data structures). The 
protection of the TCB shall provide TCB isolation 
and noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions as follows:

	1. TCB Isolation requires that (1) the address 
spaces of the TCB and those of unprivileged 
subjects are separated such that users, or 
unprivileged subjects operating on their behalf, 
cannot read or modify TCB data structures or code, 
(2) the transfers between TCB and non-TCB domains 
are controlled such that arbitrary entry to or 
return from the TCB are not possible; and (3) the 
user or application parameters passed to the TCB 
by addresses are validated with respect to the TCB 
address space, and those passed by value are 
validated with respect to the values expected by 
the TCB.

	2. Non-circumventability of TCB isolation 
functions requires that the permission to objects 
(and/or to non-TCB data) passed as parameters to 
the TCB are validated with respect to the 
permissions required by the TCB, and references to 
TCB objects implementing TCB isolation functions 
are mediated by the TCB.

TCB protection shall also maintain the consistency 
of TCB global variables and eliminate undesirable 
dependencies of the TCB on unprivileged subject or 
user actions.

	3. Consistency of TCB global variables requires 
that consistency conditions defined over TCB 
internal variables, objects, and functions hold 
before and after any TCB invocation.

	4. Elimination of undesirable dependencies of 
the TCB on unprivileged subject actions requires 
that any TCB invocation by an unprivileged subject 
(or user) input to a TCB call may not place the TCB 
in a state such that it is unable to respond to 
communication initiated by other users.

SC-1 Minimal Self Checking

Hardware and/or software features shall be 
provided that can be used to periodically validate 
the correct operation of the on-site hardware and 
firmware elements of the TCB.

PO-2 Privilege Association with TCB Modules

1. TCB privileges needed by individual functions, 
or groups of functions, of a functional component 
shall be identified. Privileged TCB calls or 
access to privileged TCB objects, such as user and 
group registration files, password files, security 
and integrity-level definition file, role 
definition file, audit-log file shall also be 
identified. It shall be possible to associate TCB 
privileges with TCB operations performed by 
administrative users. 

2.The modules of a TCB function shall be 
associated only with the privileges necessary to 
complete their task. 

3. Support for product privilege implementation 
and association with TCB modules provided by 
lower-level mechanisms or procedures (e.g., 
operating system, processors, language) shall be 
provided.

ASSURANCES 

Requirements for TCB Property Definition

PD-3 Property Specification by Model Interpretation

The developer shall provide formal models for the 
functional components and sub-components of the 
profile. At a minimum, a formal model of the 
access control components shall be provided. The 
properties of the formal models shall be clearly 
stated. The developer shall provide an 
interpretation of the models in the DIS of the 
product's TCB. For each model entity, the 
developer shall: (1) identify the TCB elements and 
their DIS (if any) that implement that entity; (2) 
define the operation of these TCB elements, and 
(3) demonstrate, by coherent arguments, that the 
DIS of these elements is consistent with the model 
properties. The developer's interpretation of each 
formal model, which specifies the TCB properties, 
shall identify all TCB and DIS elements (if any) 
that do not correspond to any model entity and 
shall explain why these elements do not render the 
TCB properties invalid.

An informal model of reference mediation and TCB 
protection shall be provided. For the components 
that are not modeled, the developer shall 
interpret the functional requirements of the 
protection profile within the product TCB. For 
each functional requirement, the developer shall: 
(1) identify the TCB elements and their TCB 
interfaces (if any) that implement that 
requirement; (2) describe the operation of these 
TCB elements, and (3) explain why the operation of 
these elements is consistent with the functional 
requirement. The developer's interpretation of 
each functional requirement, which describes the 
TCB properties, shall include all the TCB 
elements.

Requirements for TCB Element Identification

ID-2: TCB Element Justification

The vendor shall identify the TCB elements (i.e., 
software, hardware/firmware code and data 
structures). Each element must be unambiguously 
identified by its name, type, release, and version 
number (if any).

The developer shall justify the protection 
relevance of the identified elements (i.e., only 
elements that can affect the correct operation of 
the protection functions shall be included in the 
TCB). If protection-irrelevant elements are 
included in the TCB, the developer shall provide a 
rationale for such inclusion.

Requirements for TCB Interface Definition

IF-2: Interface Descriptive Specification

The developer shall define all external (e.g., 
command, software, and I/O) administrative (i.e., 
privileged) and non-administrative interfaces to 
the TCB.

The developer shall provide and maintain a 
descriptive interface specification (DIS) of the 
TCB that completely and accurately describes the 
TCB in terms of exceptions, error messages, and 
effects. The DIS shall identify the TCB call 
conventions (e.g., parameter order, call sequence 
requirements), and exceptions signaled. The DIS 
shall also include the TCB call identifier, 
parameter types (e.g., input, output), the effect 
of the call, TCB call conventions (e.g., parameter 
order, call sequence requirements), and exceptions 
handled and signaled. It shall be shown to be an 
accurate description of the TCB interface.

The DIS shall include those components of the TCB 
that are implemented as hardware and/or firmware 
if their properties are visible at the TCB 
interface.

If the TCB consists of a kernel and privileged 
processes, the developer shall separately identify 
and define the interfaces for the kernel and each 
privileged process.

The TCB interface definition must also include all 
effects of a call including the direct visibility 
and alterability of internal TCB variables and 
functions.

Requirements for Modular Decomposition

MD-2: Module-level Decomposition

The developer shall design the TCB as a small 
number (e.g., 10 to 100) of design and 
implementation subsystems that have well-defined 
functional relationships and shared-data 
dependencies. The developer shall identify the 
specific TCB protection functions (if any) 
associated with each subsystem and the TCB 
interfaces (if any) implemented by each subsystem.

The developer shall design each subsystem as a set 
of modules. For each module, the developer shall 
describe: the role or purpose of the module, the 
set of related functions performed by the module, 
and the module interface (i.e., the set of 
invocable functions, calling conventions, 
parameters, global variables, and results). The 
developer shall identify the protection functions 
of, and describe the interfaces between, these 
modules. The developer shall choose the modules so 
that the set of functions implemented by the 
module, the module's contribution to the TCB 
protection properties, and the interface(s) to the 
module can be described concisely (e.g., the 
module shall have a single purpose). The TCB 
structuring into modules shall be based on well-
defined module relationships; for example, the 
contains relation (e.g., A is part of B) or the 
"uses" relation (e.g., A is correct only if B is 
correct). 

Requirements for TCB Structuring Support

SP-2: Support for Storage Objects

The TCB shall maintain process isolation. The TCB 
shall separate those elements that are protection-
critical from those that are not. Features in 
hardware, such as segmentation, shall be used to 
support logically distinct storage objects with 
separate access-control attributes (e.g., 
readable, writable).

Requirements for Implementation Support

IM-3: Module Correspondence Support

The developer shall maintain engineering diagrams 
and source code (as applicable) for all TCB 
elements. The diagrams and source code for each 
module of the TCB shall be identified and provided 
as configuration items.

Requirements for Developer Functional Testing

FT-3: Specification-Driven TCB Interface Testing

The developer shall test the TCB interface to show 
that all claimed protection functions work as 
stated in the TCB interface description or 
specification. The tests shall exercise the 
boundary conditions of the protection functions. 
The developer shall generate the test conditions 
and data from the Descriptive Interface 
Specification(s). The developer test procedures 
shall include the tests used to demonstrate the 
absence of all flaws discovered in previous 
versions of the TCB.

The developer shall correct all flaws discovered 
by testing and shall retest the TCB to show that 
all discovered flaws have been eliminated, no new 
flaws have been introduced, and the protection 
functions work as claimed.

Requirements for Penetration Analysis

PA-2 Flaw-Hypothesis Testing

The developer shall define the TCB configuration, 
interface, and protection functions that are 
subject to penetration testing. For each test, the 
developer shall identify the goal of the test and 
the criteria for successful penetration. The 
developer shall illustrate how, in addition to 
system reference manuals and TCB interface 
description, the DIS, source code, and hardware 
and firmware specifications are used to define 
penetration-test conditions. For each test, the 
developer shall document all test conditions, data 
(e.g., test set-up, function call parameters, and 
test outcomes), and coverage. 

The developer shall generate the test conditions 
from flaw-hypotheses derived by negating 
assertions of TCB design capabilities and by 
providing counter examples that show that these 
assertions are false. The developer shall confirm 
the flaw hypotheses by checking design and 
implementation documentation, by defining the test 
data and running test programs, or by referring to 
known classes of penetration flaws found in other 
TCBs. The refutation of any hypothesis shall be 
documented.

For each uncovered flaw, the developer shall 
define and document scenarios of flaw exploitation 
and shall identify all penetration outcomes 
resulting from that scenario. The cause of the 
flaw shall be identified and documented. 

Requirements for Covert-Channel Analysis

CCA-1 Analysis of Covert Storage Channels

1. Identification: The developer shall identify 
all sources of information used in covert-storage-
channel analysis. These sources shall include TCB 
reference manuals and DIS. The developer shall 
define the identification method used. The 
developer shall demonstrate that the chosen 
identification method is sound (e.g., it leads to 
the discovery of all covert storage channels in 
the DIS or source documentation) and repeatable 
(i.e., independent evaluators can use the method 
on the same sources of covert-storage-channel 
information and can obtain the same results.) The 
developer shall define scenarios of use for each 
covert storage channel.

2. Bandwidth Measurement or Engineering 
Estimation: The developer shall define the method 
used for covert-storage-channel bandwidth 
estimation. In measuring TCB performance for 
covert-channel-bandwidth estimation, the developer 
shall satisfy the following assumptions. The 
maximum bandwidth estimation shall be based on the 
assumptions that the storage channel is noiseless, 
that the senders and receivers are not delayed by 
the presence of other processes in the product, 
and that the sender-receiver synchronization time 
is negligible. The choice of informal estimation 
methods shall define and justify the coding method 
and, therefore, the distribution of "0s" and "1s" 
in all transmissions.

The developer shall select TCB primitives to be 
measured for bandwidth determination from real 
scenarios of covert-storage-channel use. The 
developer shall specify TCB measurement 
environment for the bandwidth measurements. This 
specification shall include: (1) the speed of the 
product functions, (2) the product configuration, 
(3) the sizes of the memory and cache components, 
and (4) the product initialization. The 
sensitivity of the measurement results to 
configuration changes shall be documented. The 
covert-storage-channel measurements shall include 
the fastest TCB function calls for altering, 
viewing, and setting up the transmission 
environment; the demonstrably fastest process 
(context) switch time shall also be included in 
the bandwidth measurements. All measurements shall 
be repeatable.

3. Covert Channel Testing: The developer shall 
test all the use of all identified covert storage 
channels to determine whether the handling 
functions work as intended.

Requirements for User Guidance

UG-1: Users' Guide

The developer shall provide a User Guide which 
describes all protection services provided and 
enforced by the TCB. The User Guide shall describe 
the interaction between these services and provide 
examples of their use. The User Guide may be in the 
form of a summary, chapter or manual. The User 
Guide shall specifically describe user 
responsibilities. These shall encompass any user 
responsibilities identified in the protection 
profile.

Requirements for Administrative Guidance

AG-2: Detailed Administrative Guidance

The developer shall provide a Trusted Facility 
Manual intended for the product administrators and 
operators that describes how to use the TCB 
security services (e.g., Access Control, System 
Entry, or Audit) to enforce a system security 
policy. The Trusted Facility Manual shall include 
the procedures for securely configuring, starting, 
maintaining, and halting the TCB. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall explain how to analyze audit 
data generated by the TCB to identify and document 
user and administrator violations of this policy. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain the 
unique security-relevant privileges and functions 
of administrators and operators. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall describe the administrative 
interaction between security services.

The Trusted Facility Manual shall identify all 
hardware, firmware, software, and data structures 
comprising the TCB. The detailed audit record 
structure for each type of audit event shall be 
described. The Trusted Facility Manual shall 
explain how configure the product to mitigate, 
eliminate, or audit covert channel 
exploitation.The Trusted Facility Manual shall 
describe the cautions about and procedures for 
using the TCB as a base for site-specific secure 
applications. The Trusted Facility Manual shall 
describe procedures for securely regenerating the 
TCB after any part is changed (e.g., due to adding 
devices or installing flaw corrections to the TCB 
software).

The Trusted Facility Manual shall be distinct from 
User Guidance, and encompass any administrative 
responsibilities identified in security 
management.

Requirements for Trusted Generation

TG-2: Trusted Generation With Fail-Safe Defaults

The developer shall establish and document the 
procedures that a consumer must perform to 
generate an operational TCB from the delivered 
copy of the master TCB. The consumer documentation 
shall identify any system parameters, which are 
initialized or set during system generation, that 
affect the TCB's conformance to the protection 
profile and state the acceptable ranges of values 
for those parameters. The product shall be 
delivered with each of these parameters set to its 
fail-safe defaults.

Requirements for Life Cycle Process

LC-2: Standardized Life Cycle Process

The developer shall develop and maintain the 
product using a well defined, standardized 
engineering process. The developer shall explain 
why the process was chosen and how the developer 
uses it to develop and maintain the product. The 
process shall incorporate a security policy that 
states the technical, physical, procedural, 
personnel, and other measures used by the 
developer to protect the product and its 
documentation. The developer shall demonstrate 
that each development process and support process 
requirement of the protection profile is satisfied 
by some part, or parts, of the developer's 
process. The developer shall identify the 
programming languages used to develop the TCB 
software and reference the definitions of those 
languages. The developer shall identify any 
implementation dependent options of the 
programming language compiler(s) used to implement 
the TCB software.

Requirements for Configuration Management

CM-2: Automated Source Code Control

The developer shall establish configuration 
control and generation procedures for developing 
and maintaining the TCB. The procedures shall be 
employed to ensure that changes to the TCB are 
consistent with the product's protection 
properties and security policy. The developer 
shall employ these procedures to track changes to 
development evidence, implementation data (e.g., 
source code and hardware diagrams), executable 
versions of the TCB, test documentation and 
procedures, identified flaws, and consumer 
documentation. The procedures shall include 
automated tools to control the software source 
code that comprises the TCB.

The configuration control procedures shall assure 
a consistent mapping among documentation and code 
associated with the current version of the TCB and 
permit the regeneration of any supported version 
of the TCB.

Requirements for Evidence of TCB Protection Properties

EPP-3 Evidence of Formal Model Interpretation in the DIS

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. This documentation shall 
describe how the TCB implements the reference 
monitor concept. The developer shall also provide 
a formal access-control model and an informal 
reference mediation and TCB protection model. The 
TCB properties, which are defined by this 
correspondence and the interpretation of these 
models within the DIS of the TCB shall be 
documented by the product developer. 

Requirements for Evidence of Product Development

EPD-3: Analysis Of The TCB External Interface

The developer shall provide TCB Design 
Specifications that include: a list of the TCB 
elements (hardware, software, and firmware 
configuration items); a list of protection 
services provided to the TCB by hardware, 
software, and firmware that is not part of the 
TCB; an explanation of the techniques and criteria 
used during the modular decomposition of the TCB; 
a description of the policy allocations, 
functions, and interactions among the major TCB 
subsystems; and module level descriptions of all 
software and hardware in the TCB.

The developer shall provide a Descriptive 
Interface Specification (DIS) that describes the 
functions, effects, exceptions and error messages 
visible at the TCB interface. The developer shall 
show that the DIS is an accurate representation of 
the TCB's external interfaces.

The developer shall provide TCB Implementation 
Data consisting of the engineering diagrams for 
all hardware included in the TCB and the source 
code used to generate the TCB software and 
firmware.

Requirements for Evidence of Functional Testing

EFT-3: Evidence of Specification-Driven Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of the 
functional testing that includes the test plan, 
the test procedures, and the results of the 
functional testing. The test, plans, procedures, 
and results shall be maintained under the same 
configuration control as the TCB software. The 
test plans shall identify the TCB specification 
used in the derivation of the test conditions, 
data, and coverage analysis. 

Requirements for Evidence of Penetration Analysis

EPA-2: Evidence of Flaw-Hypothesis Generation and Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of 
penetration testing. The penetration evidence 
shall identify all product documentation and 
development evidence on which the search for flaws 
was based. The penetration evidence shall describe 
the scenarios for exploiting each potential flaw 
in the system and the penetration test conditions, 
data (e.g., test set-up, function call parameters, 
and test outcomes), coverage, and conclusions 
derived from each scenario. The penetration 
evidence shall summarize both refuted and 
confirmed flaws hypothesis.

Requirements for Evidence of Covert Channel Analysis

ECC-1: Evidence of Covert Storage Channel Analysis and 
Handling 

The developer's documentation shall present the 
results of the covert-storage-channel analysis and 
the trade-offs involved in restricting these 
channels. All auditable events that may be used in 
the exploitation of known covert storage channels 
shall be identified. The developer shall provide 
the bandwidths of known covert-storage-channels 
whose use is not detectable by the auditing 
mechanism. The documentation of each identified 
storage channel shall consist of the variable that 
can be viewed/altered by the channel and the TCB 
interface functions that can alter or view that 
variable. The measurements of each TCB function 
call used by covert-storage channels must be 
documented and the bandwidth computation shall be 
included for each channel. The measurement 
environment should be documented as specified. 
Test documentation shall include results of 
testing the effectiveness of the methods used to 
reduce covert-storage-channel bandwidths.

Requirements for Evidence of Product Support

EPS-2: Evidence of Defined Product Support

The developer shall provide documentation that 
defines the policies, procedures, plans, and tools 
established by the developer to satisfy the 
Operational Support and Development Environment 
requirements of the protection profile.

Requirements for Test Analysis

TA-4: Comprehensive Test Analysis

The evaluator shall assess whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for functional testing and 
penetration analysis, and whether the producer has 
documented these activities as defined in the 
development evidence requirements of the 
protection profile. The evaluator shall analyze 
the results of the producer's testing activities 
for completeness of coverage and consistency of 
results, and general correctness (e.g., defect 
trend from regression testing). This analysis 
shall examine the testability of requirements, the 
adequacy of the tests to measure the required 
properties, the deviation of the actual results 
obtained from the expected results. The analysis 
shall extend to trace all defects identified, 
corrected, and retested. The analysis shall 
include an assessment of test coverage and 
completeness, and defect frequency. The results of 
testing shall be interpreted in terms that express 
product performance and protection adequacy. The 
evaluator shall determine whether the product's 
protection properties, as defined for all 
protection-relevant modules of the TCB, and all 
relevant known penetration flaws have been tested. 
The evaluator shall independently develop, test, 
and document additional flaw hypotheses. The 
evaluator shall assess testing results to 
determine whether the product's TCB works as 
claimed, that the TCB's implementation is 
consistent with the DIS, and whether there are any 
obvious ways (i.e., ways that are known, or that 
are readily apparent or easily discovered in 
product documentation) for an unauthorized user to 
bypass the policy implemented by the TCB or 
otherwise defeat the product's TCB, and whether 
all discovered TCB flaws have been corrected and 
no new TCB flaws introduced. No design flaws and 
no more than a few correctable implementation 
flaws may be found during testing and there shall 
be reasonable confidence that few remain.   The 
testing results shall show that the methods used 
to reduce covert channel bandwidths have been 
effective for all evaluated configurations. The 
evaluator shall determine whether the product is 
relatively resistant to penetrations.

Requirements for Independent Testing

IT-3: Comprehensive Independent Testing.

The evaluator shall independently perform 
functional and elementary penetration testing to 
confirm test results. This testing may be 
selective and shall be based on (1) the results of 
other independent and/or producer testing, (2) the 
TCB's DIS, (3) other product design and 
implementation documentation, (4) the product's 
user and administrative documentation, (5) 
relevant known penetration flaws, and (6) 
evaluator-developed TCB penetration flaw 
hypotheses and corresponding tests that attempt to 
exploit the hypothesized flaws. Satisfactory 
completion consists of demonstrating that all TCB 
functions work as described in the product's 
relevant documentation, that test results are 
consistent, and that no discrepancies exist 
between the documentation and the product. 
Satisfactory penetration test completion shall be 
determined by the subjective judgement (which may 
be supported algorithmically) of the evaluator. 
Test duration agreements may further constrain 
this judgement. Categorization of an actual 
penetration flaw shall be based on the 
reproducibility of that flaw. Flaws that are 
discovered, but are not reproducible shall remain 
categorized as potential penetration flaws. All 
actual penetration flaws must be corrected and 
retested. 

The evaluator shall provide a penetration test 
plan document that describes the additional 
evaluator-developed flaw hypotheses and associated 
tests. The evaluator shall execute these tests and 
shall report any discovered flaws to the producer 
as part of the testing results. At the conclusion 
of penetration testing, the evaluator shall 
provide copies of this penetration test plan and 
its test results to the producer. The producer 
shall ensure that this test plan and its test 
results are incorporated into the rest of the 
product's testing documentation and that such 
documentation is available for further analysis 
throughout the life of the product.

The evaluator shall test for covert channel 
bandwidth reductions to determine the 
effectiveness of handling method(s) in reducing 
the bandwidths of identified covert channels for 
all evaluated configurations.

If the independent testing is performed at beta-
test sites, the producer shall supply the beta-
test plan and the test results. The evaluator 
shall review the scope and depth of beta testing 
with respect to the required protection 
functionality, and shall verify independence of 
both the test sites and the producer's and beta-
test user's test results. The evaluator shall also 
confirm that the test environment of the beta-test 
site(s) adequately represents the environment 
specified in the protection profile.

Requirements for Development Environment

DER-2: Enhanced Development Environment Review 

The evaluator shall review the producer's 
development and maintenance process description 
documentation and shall conduct a random audit of 
the producer's processes   using the evidence 
generated by each process to determine the degree 
of discipline enforced upon and within the 
process, and to determine the protection 
characteristics associated with the product's 
development and maintenance. The results of this 
review shall establish, for the evaluator, the 
producer's development environment, its policies, 
and the degree of enforcement maintained during 
development execution. The results of this review 
shall also confirm the producer's general 
conformance with relevant development environment 
requirements.

Requirements for Operational Support

OSR-2 Enhanced Operational Support Review

The evaluator shall review all documentation 
focused on the activities of product use (e.g., 
Users Manuals) and product administration 
including installation, operation, maintenance, 
and trusted recovery (e.g., Trusted Facility 
Management Manuals). This review shall assess the 
clarity of presentation, difficulty in locating 
topics of interest, ease of understanding, and 
completeness of coverage. The need for separate 
manuals dedicated to protection-relevant aspects 
of the product should be assessed for 
effectiveness. The evaluator shall randomly select 
a sample of the documented protection-relevant 
features and procedures and execute them to 
determine if their descriptions are accurate and 
correct.

Requirements for Design Analysis

DA-2: Enhanced Design Analysis

The evaluator shall determine whether the producer has 
performed the activities defined in the development process 
assurance requirements of the protection profile for TCB 
property definition and TCB design. The evaluator shall 
determine whether the producer has documented these 
activities as defined in the development evidence 
requirements of the protection profile. The evaluator shall 
analyze the results of the producer's activities for 
completeness, consistency, and correctness of design with 
respect to requirements.

Requirements for Implementation Analysis

CI-1: Elementary Implementation Analysis

The evaluator shall conduct a code inspection on a 
small sample of randomly selected product code. 
The assessment shall focus on clarity of the 
coding style, adherence to coding standards, 
coding documentation, and on possible software 
defects that may be present with respect to the 
product's informal design. The inspection shall be 
performed to obtain only a sample of possible 
software defects, not to capture all such possible 
defects. The evaluator shall report all discovered 
defects to the producer; the assessment shall 
report the number of defects found per line of 
code inspected from the random sample size. Use of 
producer-provided code inspection results can 
supplement this sample inspection. All trapdoors 
built into the product for maintenance purposes 
shall be identified by the producer and shown to 
be protected by the product.

LABEL-BASED PROTECTION - 3 (LP-3)

This Protection Profile has been developed to define a set 
of technical measures that can be incorporated into remote-
access, resource- and information-sharing Information 
Technology (IT) products that will be used to protect up to 
three levels and multiple categories of National Security 
Information classified according to US Executive Order 12356 
(EO 12356). This profile can also be used to protect any 
information that has been designated as sensitive information 
for which information separation and access are based on 
sensitivity markings applied to the information. This profile 
is intended for use in environments where the presence 
potentially malicious application software (e.g., Trojan 
Horses) mandate the use of high-assurance products.

Compliant IT products will provide highly-structured, 
conceptually simple protection mechanisms for a multi-level 
information processing environment with which an organization 
can construct an automated information system to enhance or 
optimize the organization's ability to perform its mission.

In LP-3 conformant systems, the TCB is demonstrably based 
on a clearly defined and documented formal security policy 
model (i.e., the interpretation of the policy model within the 
TCB is shown to be valid). The TCB is resistant to 
penetration. In relation to lower levels of protection 
functionality, LP-3 conformat systems have the following 
additional features.

a.	The TCB must satisfy all requirements of the reference 
monitor concept (i.e., TCB protection, reference 
mediation, and TCB structuring and complexity 
minimization to enhance TCB verification; viz., 
Appendix B).

b.	Covert storage and timing channels are analyzed and 
handled.

c.	The TCB includes trusted recovery functions and a 
trusted path mechanism that includes general user 
commands, not just login commands.

d.	The audit mechanisms include alarms that signal 
accumulation of events representing potential 
security violations.

e.	Security management is enhanced by the fine-grain 
separation of system administrator and operator 
functions and by the minimization of security 
irrelevant functions of security roles. 

f.	Stringent configuration management controls are 
imposed. 

g.	The TCB must be found resistant to penetration.

RATIONALE

11.	Information Protection Policy

It is anticipated that organizations wishing to process two 
to three levels of classified information with multiple 
categories will want to use IT products that are compliant 
with this profile in their automated information processing 
systems. These organizations should be able to trust the 
profile-compliant IT product to contribute to the protection 
of the classified information at least as much as they trust 
the properly cleared personnel who are using and managing the 
system.

12.	Protection Philosophy

This profile presumes a hostile environment with divided, 
aggressive users. It provides control of access to shared 
resources both (1) on the basis of attributes that are 
controlled by the ordinary users of the system and (2) on the 
basis of attributes that are controlled only by the system 
administrators.

Profile compliant IT products will minimally meet the 
following objectives:

a.	Employ a reference validation mechanism to enforce a 
formally defined security policy that describes the 
rules for controlling access to system subjects and 
objects and use the access control rules to enforce an 
information flow policy that aims to control the use 
of covert storage and timing channels.

b.	Associate explicit sensitivity labels with each 
subject and object in the system and each port through 
which information may be exported from or imported to 
the system. Maintain the accuracy of the sensitivity 
labels as information moves within the system and 
through the ports.

c.	Authenticate the claimed identity of each external 
human user of the IT product prior to establishing any 
internal entity to act on behalf of that user and 
firmly bind the authenticated user identity to the 
internal entity.

d.	Selectively keep and protect a log of all actions or 
events (including use of covert storage channels) that 
could affect system security so that they can be 
accurately attributed to the known user or system 
entity responsible for causing the action or event. 
Also, alert the system administrator when a series of 
events indicates an imminent violation of the security 
policy.

e.	Contains hardware and software mechanisms that can be 
independently evaluated to provide sufficient 
assurance that the system satisfies the previous four 
objectives.

f.	Implements the enforcement of objectives a through d 
in such a fashion that the enforcing mechanisms are 
protected from tampering and unauthorized changes by 
the information moving entities that the mechanisms 
are supposed to control.

13.	Expected Threats

The requirements for profile conforming IT products assume 
that these products are being used in an environment where 
there are different levels and categories of classified data 
and users of differing clearance levels. A conforming IT 
product can be reasonably expected to protect the 
confidentiality of information in an environment where there 
are three levels and multiple categories of classified data, 
and two or more levels of cleared users and where there are 
collaborating, malicious users and software at each clearance 
level.

14.	Assumed Environment

14.1	Characteristics

IT products complying with the requirements set forth in 
this profile are expected to be used in an environment with 
the following characteristics:

a.	Multiple users will be accessing the operating system 
at the same time.

b.	The IT product hardware base (e.g., CPU, printers, 
terminals, etc.) is protected from unauthorized 
physical access.

c.	One or more personnel are assigned to manage the 
system in which the IT product is incorporated, 
including the security of the information it contains.

d.	A need to control user access to information exists 
and is based on an explicit sensitivity marking 
associated with the information (e.g, Secret or Top 
Secret).

e.	There is a need to control user access to information 
exists and is based on that user's identity and 
membership in organizations or groups.

f.	The IT product provides facilities for some or all of 
the authorized users to create programs that use the 
applications programming interface (API) and make 
those programs available to other users.

g.	The IT product is used to provide a cooperative 
environment for the users to accomplish some task or 
group of tasks.

14.2	Environment Dependencies

Secure installation and operation of a product satisfying 
these profile requirements depends on provision of a number 
of elements in the installation environment. These include:

a.	Physical security must be provided. For US Government 
classified operation, physical security equivalent to 
PP-2 would be required.

b.	Cabling to other devices must be shown to be 
consistent with policy implemented by the product. For 
example, a "port" in the product is required to have 
an assigned label. No device can be connected to the 
port unless it has been established externally that 
the device is allowed to receive data with the same 
label.

c.	Personnel allowed to access data processed by the 
installed product must already be authorized for such 
access.

15.	Intended Use

Conforming IT products are useful in both general-purpose 
office automation environments with multiple data 
sensitivities (or "classifications") and multiple levels of 
user authorizations (or "clearances") and in specialized 
computing, network and mission environments. Examples of the 
office automation environment might include military 
headquarters and highly competitive procurement offices. 
Examples of the network environments include use as the basis 
for a multilevel secure network management center or a trusted 
guard gateway operating between two networks processing 
different levels of information. An example of the specialized 
mission environment might be as a platform for a portable 
battlefield map and mission management application.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Requirements for Identification and Authentication

I&A-2 Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

1.	The TCB shall require users to identify 
themselves to it before beginning to perform any 
other actions that the TCB is expected to mediate. 
The TCB shall be able to enforce individual 
accountability by providing the capability to 
uniquely identify each individual user. The TCB 
shall also provide the capability of associating 
this identity with all auditable actions taken by 
that individual.

2. 	The TCB shall maintain authentication data that 
includes information for verifying the identity of 
individual users (e.g., passwords) as well as 
information for determining the clearance and 
authorization of individual users. These data 
shall be used by the TCB to authenticate the 
user's identity and to ensure that the subject 
security level and authorizations of subjects 
external to the TCB that may be created to act on 
behalf of the individual user are dominated by the 
clearance and authorization of that user).

3. 	The TCB shall protect authentication data so 
that it cannot be used by any unauthorized user. 

Requirements for Trusted Path

TP-2 Trusted User-to-TCB Communication

The TCB shall support a trusted communication path 
between itself and users for use whenever a 
positive user-to-TCB connection is required (e.g., 
login, change of policy attributes). 
Communications via this trusted path shall be 
activated exclusively by a user or the TCB and 
shall be logically isolated and unmistakably 
distinguishable from other communication paths.

Requirements for Audit

AD-1+ Minimal Audit

1.	The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and 
protect from modification or unauthorized access 
or destruction an audit trail of accesses to the 
objects it protects. The audit data shall be 
protected by the TCB so that read access to it is 
limited to those who are authorized for audit 
data.

2.	The TCB shall be able to record the following 
types of events:

	- use of the identification and authentication 
mechanisms;

	- introduction of objects into a user's address 
space (e.g., file open, program initiation), and 
deletion of objects;

	- actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators and/or system security officers.

The TCB shall be able to record any override of 
human-readable output markings. The TCB shall also 
be able to audit the identified event that may be 
used in the exploitation of covert channels.

The TCB shall contain a mechanism that is able to 
monitor the occurrence or accumulation of 
auditable events that may indicate an imminent 
violation of the product's security policy. This 
mechanism shall be able to immediately notify the 
security administrator when thresholds are 
exceeded, and, if the occurrence or accumulation 
of these security relevant events continues, the 
system shall take the least disruptive action to 
terminate the event. [AD-3]

3.	For each recorded event, the audit record shall 
identify: date and time of the event, user, type 
of event, and success or failure of the event. For 
identification/authentication events the origin of 
request (e.g., terminal ID) shall be included in 
the audit record. For events that introduce an 
object into a user's address space and for object 
deletion events the audit record shall include the 
name and the object security level.

4.	The system administrator shall be able to 
selectively audit the actions of one or more users 
based on individual identity and/or object 
security level.

Requirements for Access Control

AC-3 + Extended Access Control

1.	Definition of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and protect access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. Subject 
attributes shall include named individuals or 
defined groups or both. Object attributes shall 
include defined access rights (e.g., read, write, 
execute) that can be assigned to subject 
attributes. Access control attributes 
corresponding to each individual policy shall be 
identified.

Sensitivity labels associated with each subject 
and storage object that is directly or indirectly 
accessible by subjects external to the TCB shall 
be maintained by the TCB. The sensitivity labels 
shall be used as the basis for mandatory access 
control decisions.

The subjects and objects shall be assigned 
sensitivity labels that are a combination of 
hierarchical classification levels and non-
hierarchical categories, and the labels shall be 
used as the basis for mandatory access control 
decisions. The TCB shall be able to support two or 
more such security levels.

The subject and object attributes shall accurately 
reflect the sensitivity and integrity of the 
subject or object. When exported by the TCB, 
sensitivity labels shall accurately and 
unambiguously represent the internal labels and 
shall be associated with the information being 
exported.

The TCB shall immediately notify a terminal user 
of each change in the security level associated 
with that user during an interactive session. A 
terminal user shall be able to query the TCB as 
desired for a display of the subject's complete 
sensitivity label. 

The TCB shall support the assignment of minimum 
and maximum security levels to all attached 
physical devices. These security levels shall be 
used by the TCB to enforce constraints imposed by 
the physical environments in which the devices are 
located.

2.	Administration of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and enforce rules for 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. The effect of 
these rules shall be that access permission to an 
object by users not already possessing access 
permission is assigned only by authorized users. 
These rules shall allow authorized users to 
specify and control sharing of objects by named 
individuals or defined groups of individuals, or 
by both, and shall provide controls to limit 
propagation of access rights. (i.e., these rules 
shall define the distribution, revocation, and 
review of access control attributes). The controls 
defined by these rules shall be capable of 
specifying for each named object, a list of 
individuals and a list of groups of named 
individuals, with their respective access rights 
to that object. Furthermore, for each named 
object, it shall be possible to specify a list of 
named individuals and a list of groups of named 
individuals for which no access to the object is 
given [AC-4}. These controls shall be capable of 
including or excluding access to the granularity 
of a single user.

The rules for assignment and modification of 
access control attributes shall include those for 
attribute assignment to objects during import and 
export operations. 

Export of Labeled Information

	The TCB shall designate each communication 
channel and I/O device as either single-level or 
multilevel. Any change in this designation shall 
be done manually and shall be auditable by the 
TCB. The TCB shall maintain and be able to audit 
any change in the security level or levels 
associated with a communication channel or I/O 
device.

	1. Exportation to Multilevel Devices

	When the TCB exports an object to a multilevel 
I/O device, the sensitivity label associated with 
that object shall also be exported and shall 
reside on the same physical medium as the exported 
information and shall be in the same form (i.e., 
machine-readable or human-readable form). When the 
TCB exports or imports an object over a multilevel 
communication channel, the protocol used on that 
channel shall provide for the unambiguous pairing 
between the sensitivity labels and the associated 
information that is sent or received.

	2. Exportation to Single-Level Devices

	Single-level I/O devices and single-level 
communication channels are not required to 
maintain the sensitivity labels of the information 
they process. However, the TCB shall include a 
mechanism by which the TCB and an authorized user 
reliably communicate to designate the single 
security level of information imported or exported 
via single-level communication channels or I/O 
devices.

	3. Labeling Human-Readable Output

	The system administrator shall be able to 
specify the printable label names associated with 
exported sensitivity labels. The TCB shall mark 
the beginning and end of all human-readable, 
paged, hardcopy output (e.g., line printer output) 
with human-readable sensitivity labels that 
properly represent the sensitivity of the output. 
The TCB shall, by default, mark the top and bottom 
of each page of human-readable, paged, hardcopy 
output (e.g., line printer output) with human-
readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the overall sensitivity of the output or 
that properly represent the sensitivity of the 
information on the page. The TCB shall, by default 
and in an appropriate manner, mark other forms of 
human-readable output (e.g., maps, graphics) with 
human-readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the sensitivity of the output. Any 
override of these marking defaults shall be 
auditable by the TCB.

Import of Non-labeled Data

	In order to import non-labeled data, the TCB 
shall request and receive from an authorized user 
the security level of the data, and all such 
actions shall be auditable by the TCB.

If different rules of assignment and modification 
of access control attributes apply to different 
subjects and/or objects, the totality of these 
rules shall be shown to support the defined 
policy.

3.	Authorization of Subject References to Objects

The TCB shall define and enforce authorization 
rules for the mediation of subject references to 
objects. These rules shall be based on the access 
control attributes of subjects and objects. These 
rules shall, either by explicit user action or by 
default, provide that objects are protected from 
unauthorized access. 

The scope of the authorization rules shall include 
all subjects, storage objects (e.g., processes, 
segments, devices) and associated access control 
attributes that are directly or indirectly 
accessible to subjects external to the TCB. The 
scope of the authorization rules shall also 
include all policy and status attributes of 
subjects and storage objects (e.g., quotas, object 
existence, size, access time, creation and 
modification time, locked/unlocked). If different 
rules apply to different subjects and objects, the 
totality of these rules shall be shown to support 
the defined policy. 

The authorization rules for the mandatory access 
control policy shall include:

	The TCB shall enforce a mandatory access control 
policy over all resources (i.e., subjects, storage 
objects, and I/O devices that are directly or 
indirectly accessible by subjects external to the 
TCB. The following requirements shall hold for all 
accesses between all subjects external to the TCB 
and all objects directly or indirectly accessible 
by these subjects: A subject can read an object 
only if the hierarchical classification in the 
subject's security level is greater than or equal 
to the hierarchical classification in the object's 
security level and the non- hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level include 
all the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level. A subject can write an 
object only if the hierarchical classification in 
the subject's security level is less than or equal 
to the hierarchical classification in the object's 
security level and all the non-hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level are 
included in the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level.

The authorization rules for each policy shall be 
defined separately. The TCB shall define and 
enforce the composition of policies, including the 
enforcement of the authorization rules (e.g., 
subject and object type coverage, enforcement 
precedence).

4. Subject and Object Creation and Destruction

The TCB shall control the creation and destruction 
of subjects and objects. These controls shall 
include object reuse. That is, all authorizations 
to the information contained within a storage 
object shall be revoked prior to initial 
assignment, allocation or reallocation to a 
subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage 
objects; information, including encrypted 
representations of information, produced by a 
prior subjects' actions shall be unavailable to 
any subject that obtains access to an object that 
has been released back to the system.

Requirements for Covert Channel Handling

CCH-3 Timing Channel Audit and Bandwidth Limitation

1. 	The TCB and privileged applications shall 
include functions that help audit the use of 
covert storage channels. These functions shall 
enable the identification of the transmitter, 
receiver, and specific covert channels used (e.g., 
TCB and privileged application element used to 
transmit information). TCB functions that help 
limit the bandwidth and/or eliminate covert 
storage channels shall also be provided. The 
bandwidth limits for each channel shall be 
settable by system administrators.

2. 	The functions added to the TCB and privileged 
applications for storage channel auditing shall be 
identified for each channel and shall be available 
in common product configurations. If audit 
functions are not added to certain storage 
channels (e.g., hardware storage channels), 
evidence must be provided to justify why these 
channels do not represent a security threat for 
the intended use of the product. TCB and 
privileged application functions that help limit 
the bandwidth and/or eliminate covert storage or 
timing channels shall also be available in common 
product configurations.

If channel bandwidth limitation and channel 
elimination functions are not added to certain 
storage or timing channels (e.g., hardware 
channels), evidence must be provided to justify 
why these channels do not represent a security 
threat for the intended use of the product.

Requirements for Security Management

SM-1++ Minimal Security Management

1. 	The TCB shall provide an installation mechanism 
for the setting and updating of its configuration 
parameters, and for the initialization of its 
protection-relevant data structures before any 
user or administrator policy attributes are 
defined. It shall allow the configuration of TCB 
internal databases and tables.

2. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
displaying and modifying the security policy 
parameters. 

3. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
manually displaying, modifying, or deleting user 
registration and account parameters. These 
parameters shall include unique user identifiers, 
their account, and their associated user name and 
affiliation. The TCB shall allow the manual 
enabling and disabling of user identities and/or 
accounts.

4. 	The TCB shall support separate operator and 
administrator functions. The operator functions 
shall be restricted to those necessary for 
performing routine operations. The operator 
functions shall allow the enabling and disabling 
of peripheral devices, mounting of removable 
storage media, backing-up and recovering user 
objects; maintaining the TCB hardware and software 
elements (e.g., on-site testing); and starting and 
shutting down the system. The administrative 
functions shall support separate security 
administrator and auditor roles. The TCB shall 
enable the administrators to perform their 
functions only after taking distinct auditable 
action to assume an administrator role. Non-
security functions that can be performed in the 
security administrative role shall be limited 
strictly to those essential to performing the 
security role effectively.[SM-4]

5. 	 The use of the protected mechanisms for system 
administration shall be limited to authorized 
administrative users.

Requirements for Reference Mediation

RM-3 Mediation of References to Subject and Object 
Attributes

1. 	The TCB shall mediate all references to 
subjects, objects, resources, and services (e.g., 
TCB functions) described in the TCB 
specifications. The mediation shall ensure that 
all references are directed to the appropriate 
security-policy functions.

2. 	 Reference mediation shall include control of 
references to all subjects, objects, and resources 
protected under the TCB security policy, to their 
policy (i.e., access rights, security levels) and 
status attributes (e.g., existence, length, 
locking state).

3. 	References issued by privileged subjects shall 
be mediated in accordance with the policy 
attributes defined for those subjects.

Requirements for Logical TCB Protection

P-3 TCB Isolation and Timing Consistency

The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own 
execution that protects it from external 
interference and tampering (e.g., by reading or 
modification of its code and data structures). The 
protection of the TCB shall provide TCB isolation 
and noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions as follows:

	1. TCB Isolation requires that (1) the address 
spaces of the TCB and those of unprivileged 
subjects are separated such that users, or 
unprivileged subjects operating on their behalf, 
cannot read or modify TCB data structures or code, 
(2) the transfers between TCB and non-TCB domains 
are controlled such that arbitrary entry to or 
return from the TCB are not possible; and (3) the 
user or application parameters passed to the TCB 
by addresses are validated with respect to the TCB 
address space, and those passed by value are 
validated with respect to the values expected by 
the TCB.

	2. Non-circumventability of TCB isolation 
functions requires that the permission to objects 
(and/or to non-TCB data) passed as parameters to 
the TCB are validated with respect to the 
permissions required by the TCB, and references to 
TCB objects implementing TCB isolation functions 
are mediated by the TCB.

TCB protection shall also maintain the consistency 
of TCB global variables and eliminate undesirable 
dependencies of the TCB on unprivileged subject or 
user actions.

	3. Consistency of TCB global variables requires 
that consistency conditions defined over TCB 
internal variables, objects, and functions hold 
before and after any TCB invocation.

	4. Elimination of undesirable dependencies of 
the TCB on unprivileged subject actions requires 
that any TCB invocation by an unprivileged subject 
(or user) input to a TCB call may not place the TCB 
in a state such that it is unable to respond to 
communication initiated by other users.

Furthermore, TCB protection shall maintain the 
timing consistency of condition checks.

	5. Timing consistency of condition checks 
requires that a validation check holds at the 
instant when the TCB action depending on that 
check is performed.

Requirements for TCB Self Checking

SC-1 Minimal Self Checking

Hardware and/or software features shall be 
provided that can be used to periodically validate 
the correct operation of the on-site hardware and 
firmware elements of the TCB.

Requirements for TCB Start-Up and Recovery

TR-1 Minimal Requirements for Recovery or Start-up

Procedures and/or mechanisms shall be provided to 
assure that, after a TCB failure or other 
discontinuity, recovery without protection 
compromise is obtained.

Requirements for TCB Privileged Operation

PO-2 Privilege Association with TCB Modules

1. TCB privileges needed by individual functions, 
or groups of functions, of a functional component 
shall be identified. Privileged TCB calls or 
access to privileged TCB objects, such as user and 
group registration files, password files, security 
and integrity-level definition file, role 
definition file, audit-log file shall also be 
identified. It shall be possible to associate TCB 
privileges with TCB operations performed by 
administrative users. 

2.The modules of a TCB function shall be 
associated only with the privileges necessary to 
complete their task. 

3. Support for product privilege implementation 
and association with TCB modules provided by 
lower-level mechanisms or procedures (e.g., 
operating system, processors, language) shall be 
provided.

ASSURANCES 

Requirements for TCB Property Definition

PD-3 Property Specification by Model Interpretation

The developer shall provide formal models for the 
functional components and sub-components of the 
profile. At a minimum, a formal model of the 
access control components shall be provided. The 
properties of the formal models shall be clearly 
stated. The developer shall provide an 
interpretation of the models in the DIS of the 
product's TCB. For each model entity, the 
developer shall: (1) identify the TCB elements and 
their DIS (if any) that implement that entity; (2) 
define the operation of these TCB elements, and 
(3) demonstrate, by coherent arguments, that the 
DIS of these elements is consistent with the model 
properties. The developer's interpretation of each 
formal model, which specifies the TCB properties, 
shall identify all TCB and DIS elements (if any) 
that do not correspond to any model entity and 
shall explain why these elements do not render the 
TCB properties invalid.

An informal model of reference mediation and TCB 
protection shall be provided. For the components 
that are not modeled, the developer shall 
interpret the functional requirements of the 
protection profile within the product TCB. For 
each functional requirement, the developer shall: 
(1) identify the TCB elements and their TCB 
interfaces (if any) that implement that 
requirement; (2) describe the operation of these 
TCB elements, and (3) explain why the operation of 
these elements is consistent with the functional 
requirement. The developer's interpretation of 
each functional requirement, which describes the 
TCB properties, shall include all the TCB 
elements.

Requirements for TCB Element Identification

ID-2: TCB Element Justification

The vendor shall identify the TCB elements (i.e., 
software, hardware/firmware code and data 
structures). Each element must be unambiguously 
identified by its name, type, release, and version 
number (if any).

The developer shall justify the protection 
relevance of the identified elements (i.e., only 
elements that can affect the correct operation of 
the protection functions shall be included in the 
TCB). If protection-irrelevant elements are 
included in the TCB, the developer shall provide a 
rationale for such inclusion.

Requirements for TCB Interface Definition

IF-2: Interface Descriptive Specification

The developer shall define all external (e.g., 
command, software, and I/O) administrative (i.e., 
privileged) and non-administrative interfaces to 
the TCB.

The developer shall provide and maintain a 
descriptive interface specification (DIS) of the 
TCB that completely and accurately describes the 
TCB in terms of exceptions, error messages, and 
effects. The DIS shall identify the TCB call 
conventions (e.g., parameter order, call sequence 
requirements), and exceptions signaled. The DIS 
shall also include the TCB call identifier, 
parameter types (e.g., input, output), the effect 
of the call, TCB call conventions (e.g., parameter 
order, call sequence requirements), and exceptions 
handled and signaled. It shall be shown to be an 
accurate description of the TCB interface.

The DIS shall include those components of the TCB 
that are implemented as hardware and/or firmware 
if their properties are visible at the TCB 
interface.

If the TCB consists of a kernel and privileged 
processes, the developer shall separately identify 
and define the interfaces for the kernel and each 
privileged process.

The TCB interface definition must also include all 
effects of a call including the direct visibility 
and alterability of internal TCB variables and 
functions.

Requirements for TCB Modular Decomposition

MD-3: Module Relationship Analysis

The developer shall design the TCB as a small 
number (e.g., 10 to 100) of design and 
implementation subsystems that have well-defined 
functional relationships and shared-data 
dependencies. The developer shall identify the 
specific TCB protection properties and functions 
associated with each subsystem and the TCB 
interfaces (if any) implemented by each subsystem.

The developer shall design each subsystem as a set 
of modules. For each module, the developer shall 
describe: the role or purpose of the module, the 
set of related functions performed by the module, 
and the module interface (i.e., the set of 
invocable functions, calling conventions, 
parameters, global variables, and results). The 
developer shall identify the protection functions 
of, and describe the interfaces between, these 
modules. The developer shall choose the modules so 
that the set of functions implemented by the 
module, the module's contribution to the TCB 
protection properties, and the interface(s) to the 
module can be described concisely (e.g., the 
module shall have a single purpose).   The TCB 
structuring into modules shall be based on well-
defined module relationships; for example, the 
contains relation (e.g., A is part of B), the 
"uses" relation (e.g., A is correct only if B is 
correct). The developer shall analyze the 
correctness dependencies among these modules. This 
analysis may include, but is not restricted to, 
service and environmental dependencies.

Requirements for TCB Structuring Support

SP-3: Structured Protection Mechanisms

The TCB shall maintain process isolation. The TCB 
shall separate those elements that are protection-
critical from those that are not. Features in 
hardware, such as segmentation, shall be used to 
support logically distinct storage objects with 
separate access-control attributes (e.g., 
readable, writable). The TCB shall employ a 
complete, conceptually simple, protection 
mechanism with precisely defined semantics. This 
mechanism shall play a central role in enforcing 
the internal structuring of the TCB and the 
product.

Requirements for Design Disciplines

DD-2: Extended Disciplines for TCB Structuring

The developer shall design the product to minimize 
the complexity of the TCB. System engineering 
shall be directed towards excluding from the TCB 
modules that are not protection critical.

The TCB design shall reflect use of modern 
software engineering techniques), such as data 
hiding and abstraction (i.e., data, functional, 
and control abstractions) and well-defined 
exception-handling. The TCB design shall also 
include use of layering (including a rationale for 
each layering violation), high-level 
synchronization constructs, and multi-tasking/
multi-threading.

Requirements for TCB Implementation Support

IM-3: Module Correspondence Support

The developer shall maintain engineering diagrams 
and source code (as applicable) for all TCB 
elements. The diagrams and source code for each 
module of the TCB shall be identified and provided 
as configuration items.

Requirements for Developer Functional Testing

FT-3: Specification-Driven TCB Interface Testing

The developer shall test the TCB interface to show 
that all claimed protection functions work as 
stated in the TCB interface description or 
specification. The tests shall exercise the 
boundary conditions of the protection functions. 
The developer shall generate the test conditions 
and data from the Descriptive Interface 
Specification(s). The developer test procedures 
shall include the tests used to demonstrate the 
absence of all flaws discovered in previous 
versions of the TCB.

The developer shall correct all flaws discovered 
by testing and shall retest the TCB to show that 
all discovered flaws have been eliminated, no new 
flaws have been introduced, and the protection 
functions work as claimed.

Requirements for Penetration Analysis

PA-2 Flaw-Hypothesis Testing

The developer shall define the TCB configuration, 
interface, and protection functions that are 
subject to penetration testing. For each test, the 
developer shall identify the goal of the test and 
the criteria for successful penetration. The 
developer shall illustrate how, in addition to 
system reference manuals and TCB interface 
description, the DIS, source code, and hardware 
and firmware specifications are used to define 
penetration-test conditions. For each test, the 
developer shall document all test conditions, data 
(e.g., test set-up, function call parameters, and 
test outcomes), and coverage. 

The developer shall generate the test conditions 
from flaw-hypotheses derived by negating 
assertions of TCB design capabilities and by 
providing counter examples that show that these 
assertions are false. The developer shall confirm 
the flaw hypotheses by checking design and 
implementation documentation, by defining the test 
data and running test programs, or by referring to 
known classes of penetration flaws found in other 
TCBs. The refutation of any hypothesis shall be 
documented.

For each uncovered flaw, the developer shall 
define and document scenarios of flaw exploitation 
and shall identify all penetration outcomes 
resulting from that scenario. The cause of the 
flaw shall be identified and documented.

Requirements for Covert-Channel Analysis

CCA-2 Timing Channel Analysis

1. Identification: The developer shall identify 
all sources of information used in covert-channel 
analysis. These sources shall include TCB 
reference manuals and DIS.   The sources of 
information and methods of identification shall 
include processor specifications whenever the 
identification method includes source code and 
hardware analysis. The developer shall define the 
identification method used. The developer shall 
demonstrate that the chosen identification method 
is sound (e.g., it leads to the discovery of all 
covert channels in the DIS or source 
documentation) and repeatable (i.e., independent 
evaluators can use the method on the same sources 
of covert-channel information and can obtain the 
same results.) The developer shall define 
scenarios of use for each covert channel. The 
developer shall also define timing channel 
scenarios, and shall identify all functions that 
provide independent sources of timing (e.g., CPUs, 
I/O processors). 

 2. Bandwidth Measurement or Engineering 
Estimation: The developer shall define the method 
used for covert-channel bandwidth estimation. In 
measuring TCB performance for covert-channel-
bandwidth estimation, the developer shall satisfy 
the following assumptions. The maximum bandwidth 
estimation shall be based on the assumptions that 
the covert channel is noiseless, that the senders 
and receivers are not delayed by the presence of 
other processes in the product, and that the 
sender-receiver synchronization time is 
negligible. The choice of informal estimation 
methods shall define and justify the coding method 
and, therefore, the distribution of "0s" and "1s" 
in all transmissions.

The developer shall select TCB primitives to be 
measured for bandwidth determination from real 
scenarios of covert-channel use. The developer 
shall specify TCB measurement environment for the 
bandwidth measurements. This specification shall 
include: (1) the speed of the product functions, 
(2) the product configuration, (3) the sizes of 
the memory and cache components, and (4) the 
product initialization. The sensitivity of the 
measurement results to configuration changes shall 
be documented. The covert-channel measurements 
shall include the fastest TCB function calls for 
altering, viewing, and setting up the transmission 
environment; the demonstrably fastest process 
(context) switch time shall also be included in 
the bandwidth measurements. All measurements shall 
be repeatable.

3. Covert Channel Testing: The developer shall 
test all the use of all identified covert channels 
to determine whether the handling functions work 
as intended.

Requirements for User Guidance

UG-1: Users' Guide

The developer shall provide a User Guide which 
describes all protection services provided and 
enforced by the TCB. The User Guide shall describe 
the interaction between these services and provide 
examples of their use. The User Guide may be in the 
form of a summary, chapter or manual. The User 
Guide shall specifically describe user 
responsibilities. These shall encompass any user 
responsibilities identified in the protection 
profile.

Requirements for Administrative Guidance

AG-3: Role-Based Administrative Guidance

The developer shall provide a Trusted Facility 
Manual intended for the product administrators and 
operators that describes how to use the TCB 
security services (e.g., Access Control, System 
Entry, or Audit) to enforce a system security 
policy. The Trusted Facility Manual shall include 
the procedures for securely configuring, starting, 
maintaining, and halting the TCB. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall explain how to analyze audit 
data generated by the TCB to identify and document 
user and administrator violations of this policy. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain the 
unique security-relevant privileges and functions 
of administrators and operators. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall also explain the distinct 
security-relevant privileges and functions of the 
TCB and how they can be selectively granted to 
provide fine-grained, multi-person or multi-role 
system and application administration policies. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall describe the 
administrative interaction between security 
services.

The Trusted Facility Manual shall identify all 
hardware, firmware, software, and data structures 
comprising the TCB. The detailed audit record 
structure for each type of audit event shall be 
described. The Trusted Facility Manual shall 
explain how to configure the product to mitigate, 
eliminate, or audit covert channel exploitation. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall describe the 
cautions about and procedures for using the TCB as 
a base for site-specific secure applications. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall describe procedures 
for securely regenerating the TCB after any part 
is changed (e.g., due to adding devices or 
installing flaw corrections to the TCB software).

The Trusted Facility Manual shall be distinct from 
User Guidance, and encompass any administrative 
responsibilities identified in security 
management.

Requirements for Trusted Generation

TG-3: Trusted Generation With Secure State Review

The developer shall establish and document the 
procedures that a consumer must perform to 
generate an operational TCB from the delivered 
copy of the master TCB. The consumer documentation 
shall identify any system parameters, which are 
initialized or set during system generation, that 
affect the TCB's conformance to the protection 
profile and state the acceptable ranges of values 
for those parameters. The product shall be 
delivered with each of these parameters set to its 
fail-safe defaults. The developer shall provide 
the consumer with a capability to review the 
product security state (e.g., by providing a 
program, which could be executed after generating 
and starting the TCB, that determines the 
consistency of the protection-relevant 
parameters).

Requirements for Life Cycle Definition

LC-3: Measurable Life Cycle Process

The developer shall develop and maintain the 
product using a well defined, standardized, and 
measurable engineering process. The developer 
shall explain why the process was chosen and how 
the developer uses it to develop and maintain the 
product. The developer shall comply with the 
engineering process standard. The process shall 
incorporate a security policy that states the 
technical, physical, procedural, personnel, and 
other measures used by the developer to protect 
the product and its documentation. The developer 
shall demonstrate that each development process 
and support process requirement of the protection 
profile is satisfied by some part, or parts, of 
the developer's process. The developer shall 
identify the programming languages used to develop 
the TCB software and reference the definitions of 
those languages. The developer shall identify any 
implementation dependent options of the 
programming language compiler(s) used to implement 
the TCB software and reference the definitions of 
those languages.The developer shall describe 
coding standards followed during the 
implementation of the product and shall ensure 
that all source code complies with these 
standards.

Requirements for Configuration Management

CM-3: Comprehensive Automated Control

The developer shall establish configuration 
control and generation procedures employing 
automated tools for developing and maintaining the 
TCB. The procedures shall be employed to ensure 
that changes to the TCB are consistent with the 
product's protection properties and security 
policy. The developer shall employ these tools to 
track and control changes to development evidence, 
implementation data (e.g., source code and 
hardware diagrams), executable versions of the 
TCB, test documentation and procedures, identified 
flaws, and consumer documentation. The procedures 
shall include a formal acceptance process for 
protection-relevant changes.

The configuration control procedures shall assure 
a consistent mapping among documentation and code 
associated with the current version of the TCB and 
permit the regeneration of any supported version 
of the TCB. The developer shall provide tools for 
the generation of a new version of the TCB from 
source code. Also, tools shall be available for 
comparing a newly generated version with the 
previous TCB version to ascertain that only the 
intended changes have been made in the code that 
will actually be used as the new version of the 
TCB. 

Requirements for Evidence of TCB Protection Properties

EPP-3 Evidence of Formal Model Interpretation in the DIS

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. This documentation shall 
describe how the TCB implements the reference 
monitor concept. The developer shall also provide 
a formal access-control model and an informal 
reference mediation and TCB protection model. The 
TCB properties, which are defined by this 
correspondence and the interpretation of these 
models within the DIS of the TCB shall be 
documented by the product developer.

Requirements for Evidence of Product Development

EPD-4: Policy Consistency Of The DIS

The developer shall provide TCB Design 
Specifications that include: a list of the TCB 
elements (hardware, software, and firmware 
configuration items); a list of protection 
services provided to the TCB by hardware, 
software, and firmware that is not part of the 
TCB; an explanation of the techniques and criteria 
used during the modular decomposition of the TCB; 
a description of the policy allocations, 
functions, and interactions among the major TCB 
subsystems; and module level descriptions of all 
software and hardware in the TCB.

The developer shall provide a Descriptive 
Interface Specification (DIS) that describes the 
functions, effects, exceptions and error messages 
visible at the TCB interface and includes a 
convincing argument that the DIS is consistent 
with the formal model of the policy. The developer 
shall show that the DIS is an accurate 
representation of the TCB's external interfaces.

The developer shall provide TCB Implementation 
Data consisting of the engineering diagrams for 
all hardware included in the TCB and the source 
code used to generate the TCB software and 
firmware. The developer shall show that the TCB 
software, firmware, and hardware implement the 
documented TCB design.

Requirements for Evidence of Functional Testing

EFT-3: Evidence of Specification-Driven Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of the 
functional testing that includes the test plan, 
the test procedures, and the results of the 
functional testing. The test, plans, procedures, 
and results shall be maintained under the same 
configuration control as the TCB software. The 
test plans shall identify the TCB specification 
used in the derivation of the test conditions, 
data, and coverage analysis.

Requirements for Evidence of Penetration Analysis

EPA-2: Evidence of Flaw-Hypothesis Generation and Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of 
penetration testing. The penetration evidence 
shall identify all product documentation and 
development evidence on which the search for flaws 
was based. The penetration evidence shall describe 
the scenarios for exploiting each potential flaw 
in the system and the penetration test conditions, 
data (e.g., test set-up, function call parameters, 
and test outcomes), coverage, and conclusions 
derived from each scenario. The penetration 
evidence shall summarize both refuted and 
confirmed flaws hypothesis.

Requirements for Evidence of Covert Channel Analysis

ECC-2: Evidence of Covert Channel Analysis and Handling

The developer's documentation shall present the 
results of the covert channel analysis and the 
trade-offs involved in restricting these channels. 
All auditable events that may be used in the 
exploitation of known covert channels shall be 
identified. The developer shall provide the 
bandwidths of known covert channels whose use is 
not detectable by the auditing mechanism. The 
documentation of each identified covert channel 
shall consist of the variables, timing sources, 
and the TCB interface functions that can be used 
to transmit information. The measurements of each 
TCB function call used by covert channels must be 
documented and the bandwidth computation shall be 
included for each channel. The measurement 
environment should be documented as specified. 
Test documentation shall include results of 
testing the effectiveness of the methods used to 
reduce covert-channel bandwidths.

Requirements for Evidence of Product Support

EPS-3: Evidence of Measured Product Support

The developer shall provide documentation that 
defines, explains, and justifies the policies, 
procedures, plans, and tools established by the 
developer to satisfy the Operational Support and 
Development Environment requirements of the 
protection profile. The documentation shall also 
explain how the developer periodically evaluates 
compliance with the established procedures, 
policies, and plans.

Requirements for Test Analysis

TA-4: Comprehensive Test Analysis

The evaluator shall assess whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for functional testing and 
penetration analysis, and whether the producer has 
documented these activities as defined in the 
development evidence requirements of the 
protection profile. The evaluator shall analyze 
the results of the producer's testing activities 
for completeness of coverage and consistency of 
results, and general correctness (e.g., defect 
trend from regression testing). This analysis 
shall examine the testability of requirements, the 
adequacy of the tests to measure the required 
properties, the deviation of the actual results 
obtained from the expected results. The analysis 
shall extend to trace all defects identified, 
corrected, and retested. The analysis shall 
include an assessment of test coverage and 
completeness, and defect frequency. The results of 
testing shall be interpreted in terms that express 
product performance and protection adequacy. The 
evaluator shall determine whether the product's 
protection properties, as defined for all 
protection-relevant modules of the TCB, and all 
relevant known penetration flaws have been tested. 
The evaluator shall independently develop, test, 
and document additional flaw hypotheses. The 
evaluator shall assess testing results to 
determine whether the product's TCB works as 
claimed, that the TCB's implementation is 
consistent with the DIS, and whether there are any 
obvious ways (i.e., ways that are known, or that 
are readily apparent or easily discovered in 
product documentation) for an unauthorized user to 
bypass the policy implemented by the TCB or 
otherwise defeat the product's TCB, and whether 
all discovered TCB flaws have been corrected and 
no new TCB flaws introduced. No design flaws and 
no more than a few correctable implementation 
flaws may be found during testing and there shall 
be reasonable confidence that few remain.   The 
testing results shall show that the methods used 
to reduce covert channel bandwidths have been 
effective for all evaluated configurations. The 
evaluator shall determine whether the product is 
relatively resistant to penetrations.

Requirements for Independent Testing

IT-3: Comprehensive Independent Testing.

The evaluator shall independently perform 
functional and elementary penetration testing to 
confirm test results. This testing may be 
selective and shall be based on (1) the results of 
other independent and/or producer testing, (2) the 
TCB's DIS, (3) other product design and 
implementation documentation, (4) the product's 
user and administrative documentation, (5) 
relevant known penetration flaws, and (6) 
evaluator-developed TCB penetration flaw 
hypotheses and corresponding tests that attempt to 
exploit the hypothesized flaws. Satisfactory 
completion consists of demonstrating that all TCB 
functions work as described in the product's 
relevant documentation, that test results are 
consistent, and that no discrepancies exist 
between the documentation and the product. 
Satisfactory penetration test completion shall be 
determined by the subjective judgement (which may 
be supported algorithmically) of the evaluator. 
Test duration agreements may further constrain 
this judgement. Categorization of an actual 
penetration flaw shall be based on the 
reproducibility of that flaw. Flaws that are 
discovered, but are not reproducible shall remain 
categorized as potential penetration flaws. All 
actual penetration flaws must be corrected and 
retested. 

The evaluator shall provide a penetration test 
plan document that describes the additional 
evaluator-developed flaw hypotheses and associated 
tests. The evaluator shall execute these tests and 
shall report any discovered flaws to the producer 
as part of the testing results. At the conclusion 
of penetration testing, the evaluator shall 
provide copies of this penetration test plan and 
its test results to the producer. The producer 
shall ensure that this test plan and its test 
results are incorporated into the rest of the 
product's testing documentation and that such 
documentation is available for further analysis 
throughout the life of the product.

The evaluator shall test for covert channel 
bandwidth reductions to determine the 
effectiveness of handling method(s) in reducing 
the bandwidths of identified covert channels for 
all evaluated configurations.

If the independent testing is performed at beta-
test sites, the producer shall supply the beta-
test plan and the test results. The evaluator 
shall review the scope and depth of beta testing 
with respect to the required protection 
functionality, and shall verify independence of 
both the test sites and the producer's and beta-
test user's test results. The evaluator shall also 
confirm that the test environment of the beta-test 
site(s) adequately represents the environment 
specified in the protection profile.

Requirements for Development Environment

DER-3: Comprehensive Development Environment Review

The evaluator shall review the producer's 
development and maintenance process description 
documentation and shall conduct a complete audit 
of the producer's processes using the evidence 
generated by each process to determine the degree 
of discipline enforced upon and within the 
process, and to determine the protection 
characteristics associated with the product's 
development and maintenance. The results of this 
review shall establish, for the evaluator, the 
producer's development environment, its policies, 
and the degree of enforcement maintained during 
development execution. The review shall also 
confirm the producer's complete conformance with 
all relevant development environment requirements.

Requirements for Operational Support

OSR-3 Comprehensive Operational Support Review

The evaluator shall review all documentation 
focused on the activities of product use (e.g., 
Users Manuals) and product administration 
including installation, operation, maintenance, 
and trusted recovery (e.g., Trusted Facility 
Management manuals. This review shall assess the 
clarity of presentation, difficulty in locating 
topics of interest, ease of understanding, and 
completeness of coverage. The need for separate 
manuals dedicated to protection-relevant aspects 
of the product should be assessed for 
effectiveness. The evaluator shall execute all 
documented protection-relevant features and 
procedures to determine if their descriptions are 
accurate and correct.

Requirements for Design Analysis

DA-3: Comprehensive Design Analysis

The evaluator shall determine whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development process assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for TCB property definition and 
TCB design. The evaluator shall determine whether 
the producer has documented these activities as 
defined in the development evidence requirements 
of the protection profile. The evaluator shall 
analyze, with the help of formal methods and 
appropriate automated tools, the results of the 
producer's activities for completeness, 
consistency, and correctness of design with 
respect to requirements (e.g., validating the 
formal verification of the design).

Requirements for Implementation

CI-3: Comprehensive Implementation Analysis

The evaluator shall conduct an inspection on a 
moderate sample of randomly selected product code. 
The assessment shall focus on the clarity of the 
coding style, adherence to coding standards, 
coding documentation, and on possible software 
defects that may be present with respect to the 
product's formal design and model. The inspection 
shall be performed to obtain only a sample of 
possible software defects, not to capture all such 
possible defects. The evaluator shall report all 
discovered defects to the producer; the assessment 
shall report the number of defects found per line 
of code inspected from the random sample size. Use 
of producer-provided code inspection results can 
supplement this inspection. All trapdoors built 
into the product for maintenance purposes shall be 
identified by the producer and shown to be 
protected by the product. The producer shall 
correct all discovered defects and the corrected 
software reinspected. A rigorous analysis of the 
implementation's correspondence to the verified 
design shall be performed by the evaluator to 
validate correctness. Such analysis may be 
supported by appropriate automated tools.

LABEL-BASED PROTECTION - 4 (LP-4)

This Protection Profile has been developed to define a set 
of technical measures that can be incorporated into remote-
access, resource- and information-sharing Information 
Technology (IT) products that will be used to protect two or 
more levels of National Security Information classified 
according to US Executive Order 12356 (EO 12356). This profile 
can also be used to protect any information that has been 
designated as sensitive information for which information 
separation and access are based on sensitivity markings 
applied to the information. This profile is intended for use 
in environments where the presence potentially malicious 
application software (e.g., Trojan Horses) mandate the use of 
high-assurance products.

Compliant IT products will provide highly-structured, 
conceptually simple protection mechanisms for a multi-level 
information processing environment with which an organization 
can construct an automated information system to enhance or 
optimize the organization's ability to perform its mission. 
Formal assurance of security policy support and covert channel 
analysis must be available. Compliant IT products are 
maintained under very strict configuration management 
facilities and can only be distributed via a trusted 
distribution channel.

LP-4 compliant products are functionally equivalent to 
those satisfying profile LP3 in that no additional 
architectural features or policy requirements are added. The 
distinguishing feature of systems in this class is the 
analysis derived from formal design specifications and 
verification techniques and the resulting high degree of 
assurance that the TCB is correctly implemented. This 
assurance is developmental in nature, starting with a formal 
model of the security policy and a formal interface 
specification (FIS) of the design. Independent of the 
particular specification language or verification system 
used, there are five important criteria for profile LP-4 
design verification:

a.	A formal model of the security policy must be clearly 
identified and documented, including a mathematical 
proof that the model interpretation in the TCB is 
valid (i.e., the model interpretation is consistent 
with the model axioms) and is sufficient to support 
the security policy.

b.	A FIS must be produced that includes abstract 
definitions of the functions the TCB performs and of 
the hardware and/or firmware mechanisms that are used 
to support separate execution domains.

c.	The FIS of the TCB must be shown to be consistent with 
the model by formal techniques where possible (i.e., 
where verification tools exist) and informal ones 
otherwise.

d.	The TCB implementation (i.e., in hardware, firmware, 
and software) must be informally shown to be 
consistent with the FIS. The elements of the FIS must 
be shown, using informal techniques, to correspond to 
the elements of the TCB. The FIS must express the 
unified protection mechanism required to satisfy the 
security policy, and it is the elements of this 
protection mechanism that are mapped to the elements 
of the TCB.

e.	Formal analysis techniques must be used to identify 
and analyze covert channels. Informal techniques may 
be used to identify covert timing channels. the 
continued existence of identified covert channels in 
the system must be justified.

In keeping with the extensive design and development 
analysis of the TCB required of LP4 compliant systems, 
stringent configuration management is required and procedures 
are established for securely distributing the system to sites. 
A system security administrator is supported.

RATIONALE

16.	Information Protection Policy

 It is anticipated that organizations wishing to process 
two to three levels of classified information with multiple 
categories will want to use IT products that are compliant 
with this profile in their automated information processing 
systems. These organizations should be able to trust the 
profile-compliant IT product to contribute to the protection 
of the classified information at least as much as they trust 
the properly cleared personnel who are using and managing the 
system.

17.	Protection Philosophy

This profile presumes a hostile environment with divided, 
aggressive users. It provides control of access to shared 
resources both (1) on the basis of attributes that are 
controlled by the ordinary users of the system and (2) on the 
basis of attributes that are controlled only by the system 
administrators.

Profile compliant IT products will minimally meet the 
following objectives:

a.	Employ a reference validation mechanism to enforce a 
formally defined security policy that describes the 
rules for controlling access to system subjects and 
objects and use the access control rules to enforce an 
information flow policy that aims to control the use 
of covert storage and timing channels.

b.	Associate explicit sensitivity labels with each 
subject and object in the system and each port through 
which information may be exported from or imported to 
the system. Maintain the accuracy of the sensitivity 
labels as information moves within the system and 
through the ports.

c.	Authenticate the claimed identity of each external 
human user of the IT product prior to establishing any 
internal entity to act on behalf of that user and 
firmly bind the authenticated user identity to the 
internal entity.

d.	Selectively keep and protect a log of all actions or 
events (including use of covert storage channels) that 
could affect system security so that they can be 
accurately attributed to the known user or system 
entity responsible for causing the action or event. 
Also, alert the system administrator when a series of 
events indicates an imminent violation of the security 
policy.

e.	Contains hardware and software mechanisms that can be 
independently evaluated to provide sufficient 
assurance that the system satisfies the previous four 
objectives.

f.	Implements the enforcement of objectives a through d 
in such a fashion that the enforcing mechanisms are 
protected from tampering and unauthorized changes by 
the information moving entities that the mechanisms 
are supposed to control.

18.	Expected Threats

The requirements for profile conforming IT products assume 
that these products are being used in an environment where 
there are different levels and categories of classified data 
and users of differing clearance levels. A conforming IT 
product can be reasonably expected to protect the 
confidentiality of information in an environment where there 
are three levels and multiple categories of classified data, 
and two or more levels of cleared users and where there are 
collaborating, malicious users and software at each clearance 
level.

19.	Assumed Environment 

19.1	Characteristics

IT products complying with the requirements set forth in 
this profile are expected to be used in an environment with 
the following characteristics:

a.	Multiple users will be accessing the operating system 
at the same time.

b.	The IT product hardware base (e.g., CPU, printers, 
terminals, etc.) is protected from unauthorized 
physical access.

c.	One or more personnel are assigned to manage the 
system in which the IT product is incorporated, 
including the security of the information it contains.

d.	A need to control user access to information exists 
and is based on an explicit sensitivity marking 
associated with the information (e.g, Secret or Top 
Secret).

e.	There is a need to control user access to information 
exists and is based on that user's identity and 
membership in organizations or groups.

f.	The IT product provides facilities for some or all of 
the authorized users to create programs that use the 
applications programming interface (API) and make 
those programs available to other users.

g.	The IT product is used to provide a cooperative 
environment for the users to accomplish some task or 
group of tasks.

19.2	Environment Dependencies

Secure installation and operation of a product satisfying 
these profile requirements depends on provision of a number 
of elements in the installation environment. These include:

a.	Physical security must be provided. For US Government 
classified operation, physical security equivalent to 
PP-2 would be required.

b.	Cabling to other devices must be shown to be 
consistent with policy implemented by the product. For 
example, a "port" in the product is required to have 
an assigned label. No device can be connected to the 
port unless it has been established externally that 
the device is allowed to receive data with the same 
label.

c.	Personnel allowed to access data processed by the 
installed product must already be authorized for such 
access.

20.	Intended Use

Conforming IT products are useful in both general-purpose 
office automation environments with multiple data 
sensitivities (or "classifications") and multiple levels of 
user authorizations (or "clearances") and in specialized 
computing, network and mission environments. Examples of the 
office automation environment might include military 
headquarters and highly competitive procurement offices. 
Examples of the network environments include use as the basis 
for a multilevel secure network management center or a trusted 
guard gateway operating between two networks processing 
different levels of information. An example of the specialized 
mission environment might be as a platform for a portable 
battlefield map and mission management application.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Requirements for Identification and Authentication

I&A-2 Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

1.	The TCB shall require users to identify 
themselves to it before beginning to perform any 
other actions that the TCB is expected to mediate. 
The TCB shall be able to enforce individual 
accountability by providing the capability to 
uniquely identify each individual user. The TCB 
shall also provide the capability of associating 
this identity with all auditable actions taken by 
that individual.

2. 	The TCB shall maintain authentication data that 
includes information for verifying the identity of 
individual users (e.g., passwords) as well as 
information for determining the clearance and 
authorization of individual users. These data 
shall be used by the TCB to authenticate the 
user's identity and to ensure that the subject 
security level and authorizations of subjects 
external to the TCB that may be created to act on 
behalf of the individual user are dominated by the 
clearance and authorization of that user).

3. 	The TCB shall protect authentication data so 
that it cannot be used by any unauthorized user. 

Requirements for Trusted Path

TP-2 Trusted User-to-TCB Communication

The TCB shall support a trusted communication path 
between itself and users for use whenever a 
positive user-to-TCB connection is required (e.g., 
login, change of policy attributes). 
Communications via this trusted path shall be 
activated exclusively by a user or the TCB and 
shall be logically isolated and unmistakably 
distinguishable from other communication paths.

Requirements for Audit

AD-1+ Minimal Audit

1.	The TCB shall be able to create, maintain, and 
protect from modification or unauthorized access 
or destruction an audit trail of accesses to the 
objects it protects. The audit data shall be 
protected by the TCB so that read access to it is 
limited to those who are authorized for audit 
data.

2.	The TCB shall be able to record the following 
types of events:

	- use of the identification and authentication 
mechanisms;

	- introduction of objects into a user's address 
space (e.g., file open, program initiation), and 
deletion of objects;

	- actions taken by computer operators and system 
administrators and/or system security officers.

The TCB shall be able to record any override of 
human-readable output markings. The TCB shall also 
be able to audit the identified event that may be 
used in the exploitation of covert channels.

The TCB shall contain a mechanism that is able to 
monitor the occurrence or accumulation of 
auditable events that may indicate an imminent 
violation of the product's security policy. This 
mechanism shall be able to immediately notify the 
security administrator when thresholds are 
exceeded, and, if the occurrence or accumulation 
of these security relevant events continues, the 
system shall take the least disruptive action to 
terminate the event. [AD-3]

3.	For each recorded event, the audit record shall 
identify: date and time of the event, user, type 
of event, and success or failure of the event. For 
identification/authentication events the origin of 
request (e.g., terminal ID) shall be included in 
the audit record. For events that introduce an 
object into a user's address space and for object 
deletion events the audit record shall include the 
name and the object security level.

4.	The system administrator shall be able to 
selectively audit the actions of one or more users 
based on individual identity and/or object 
security level.

Requirements for Access Control

AC-3 + Extended Access Control

1.	Definition of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and protect access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. Subject 
attributes shall include named individuals or 
defined groups or both. Object attributes shall 
include defined access rights (e.g., read, write, 
execute) that can be assigned to subject 
attributes. Access control attributes 
corresponding to each individual policy shall be 
identified.

Sensitivity labels associated with each subject 
and storage object that is directly or indirectly 
accessible by subjects external to the TCB shall 
be maintained by the TCB. The sensitivity labels 
shall be used as the basis for mandatory access 
control decisions.

The subjects and objects shall be assigned 
sensitivity labels that are a combination of 
hierarchical classification levels and non-
hierarchical categories, and the labels shall be 
used as the basis for mandatory access control 
decisions. The TCB shall be able to support two or 
more such security levels.

The subject and object attributes shall accurately 
reflect the sensitivity and integrity of the 
subject or object. When exported by the TCB, 
sensitivity labels shall accurately and 
unambiguously represent the internal labels and 
shall be associated with the information being 
exported.

The TCB shall immediately notify a terminal user 
of each change in the security level associated 
with that user during an interactive session. A 
terminal user shall be able to query the TCB as 
desired for a display of the subject's complete 
sensitivity label. 

The TCB shall support the assignment of minimum 
and maximum security levels to all attached 
physical devices. These security levels shall be 
used by the TCB to enforce constraints imposed by 
the physical environments in which the devices are 
located.

2.	Administration of Access Control Attributes

The TCB shall define and enforce rules for 
assignment and modification of access control 
attributes for subjects and objects. The effect of 
these rules shall be that access permission to an 
object by users not already possessing access 
permission is assigned only by authorized users. 
These rules shall allow authorized users to 
specify and control sharing of objects by named 
individuals or defined groups of individuals, or 
by both, and shall provide controls to limit 
propagation of access rights. (i.e., these rules 
shall define the distribution, revocation, and 
review of access control attributes). The controls 
defined by these rules shall be capable of 
specifying for each named object, a list of 
individuals and a list of groups of named 
individuals, with their respective access rights 
to that object. Furthermore, for each named 
object, it shall be possible to specify a list of 
named individuals and a list of groups of named 
individuals for which no access to the object is 
given [AC-4}. These controls shall be capable of 
including or excluding access to the granularity 
of a single user.

The rules for assignment and modification of 
access control attributes shall include those for 
attribute assignment to objects during import and 
export operations. 

Export of Labeled Information

	The TCB shall designate each communication 
channel and I/O device as either single-level or 
multilevel. Any change in this designation shall 
be done manually and shall be auditable by the 
TCB. The TCB shall maintain and be able to audit 
any change in the security level or levels 
associated with a communication channel or I/O 
device.

	1. Exportation to Multilevel Devices

	When the TCB exports an object to a multilevel 
I/O device, the sensitivity label associated with 
that object shall also be exported and shall 
reside on the same physical medium as the exported 
information and shall be in the same form (i.e., 
machine-readable or human-readable form). When the 
TCB exports or imports an object over a multilevel 
communication channel, the protocol used on that 
channel shall provide for the unambiguous pairing 
between the sensitivity labels and the associated 
information that is sent or received.

	2. Exportation to Single-Level Devices

	Single-level I/O devices and single-level 
communication channels are not required to 
maintain the sensitivity labels of the information 
they process. However, the TCB shall include a 
mechanism by which the TCB and an authorized user 
reliably communicate to designate the single 
security level of information imported or exported 
via single-level communication channels or I/O 
devices.

	3. Labeling Human-Readable Output

	The system administrator shall be able to 
specify the printable label names associated with 
exported sensitivity labels. The TCB shall mark 
the beginning and end of all human-readable, 
paged, hardcopy output (e.g., line printer output) 
with human-readable sensitivity labels that 
properly represent the sensitivity of the output. 
The TCB shall, by default, mark the top and bottom 
of each page of human-readable, paged, hardcopy 
output (e.g., line printer output) with human-
readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the overall sensitivity of the output or 
that properly represent the sensitivity of the 
information on the page. The TCB shall, by default 
and in an appropriate manner, mark other forms of 
human-readable output (e.g., maps, graphics) with 
human-readable sensitivity labels that properly 
represent the sensitivity of the output. Any 
override of these marking defaults shall be 
auditable by the TCB.

Import of Non-labeled Data

	In order to import non-labeled data, the TCB 
shall request and receive from an authorized user 
the security level of the data, and all such 
actions shall be auditable by the TCB.

If different rules of assignment and modification 
of access control attributes apply to different 
subjects and/or objects, the totality of these 
rules shall be shown to support the defined 
policy.

3.	Authorization of Subject References to Objects

The TCB shall define and enforce authorization 
rules for the mediation of subject references to 
objects. These rules shall be based on the access 
control attributes of subjects and objects. These 
rules shall, either by explicit user action or by 
default, provide that objects are protected from 
unauthorized access. 

The scope of the authorization rules shall include 
all subjects, storage objects (e.g., processes, 
segments, devices) and associated access control 
attributes that are directly or indirectly 
accessible to subjects external to the TCB. The 
scope of the authorization rules shall also 
include all policy and status attributes of 
subjects and storage objects (e.g., quotas, object 
existence, size, access time, creation and 
modification time, locked/unlocked). If different 
rules apply to different subjects and objects, the 
totality of these rules shall be shown to support 
the defined policy. 

The authorization rules for the mandatory access 
control policy shall include:

	The TCB shall enforce a mandatory access control 
policy over all resources (i.e., subjects, storage 
objects, and I/O devices that are directly or 
indirectly accessible by subjects external to the 
TCB. The following requirements shall hold for all 
accesses between all subjects external to the TCB 
and all objects directly or indirectly accessible 
by these subjects: A subject can read an object 
only if the hierarchical classification in the 
subject's security level is greater than or equal 
to the hierarchical classification in the object's 
security level and the non- hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level include 
all the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level. A subject can write an 
object only if the hierarchical classification in 
the subject's security level is less than or equal 
to the hierarchical classification in the object's 
security level and all the non-hierarchical 
categories in the subject's security level are 
included in the non-hierarchical categories in the 
object's security level.

The authorization rules for each policy shall be 
defined separately. The TCB shall define and 
enforce the composition of policies, including the 
enforcement of the authorization rules (e.g., 
subject and object type coverage, enforcement 
precedence).

4. Subject and Object Creation and Destruction

The TCB shall control the creation and destruction 
of subjects and objects. These controls shall 
include object reuse. That is, all authorizations 
to the information contained within a storage 
object shall be revoked prior to initial 
assignment, allocation or reallocation to a 
subject from the TCB's pool of unused storage 
objects; information, including encrypted 
representations of information, produced by a 
prior subjects' actions shall be unavailable to 
any subject that obtains access to an object that 
has been released back to the system.

Requirements for Covert Channel Handling

CCH-3 Timing Channel Audit and Bandwidth Limitation

1. 	The TCB and privileged applications shall 
include functions that help audit the use of 
covert storage channels. These functions shall 
enable the identification of the transmitter, 
receiver, and specific covert channels used (e.g., 
TCB and privileged application element used to 
transmit information). TCB functions that help 
limit the bandwidth and/or eliminate covert 
storage channels shall also be provided. The 
bandwidth limits for each channel shall be 
settable by system administrators.

2. 	The functions added to the TCB and privileged 
applications for storage channel auditing shall be 
identified for each channel and shall be available 
in common product configurations. If audit 
functions are not added to certain storage 
channels (e.g., hardware storage channels), 
evidence must be provided to justify why these 
channels do not represent a security threat for 
the intended use of the product. TCB and 
privileged application functions that help limit 
the bandwidth and/or eliminate covert storage or 
timing channels shall also be available in common 
product configurations.

If channel bandwidth limitation and channel 
elimination functions are not added to certain 
storage or timing channels (e.g., hardware 
channels), evidence must be provided to justify 
why these channels do not represent a security 
threat for the intended use of the product.

Requirements for Security Management

SM-1++ Minimal Security Management

1. 	The TCB shall provide an installation mechanism 
for the setting and updating of its configuration 
parameters, and for the initialization of its 
protection-relevant data structures before any 
user or administrator policy attributes are 
defined. It shall allow the configuration of TCB 
internal databases and tables.

2. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
displaying and modifying the security policy 
parameters. 

3. 	The TCB shall provide protected mechanisms for 
manually displaying, modifying, or deleting user 
registration and account parameters. These 
parameters shall include unique user identifiers, 
their account, and their associated user name and 
affiliation. The TCB shall allow the manual 
enabling and disabling of user identities and/or 
accounts.

4. 	The TCB shall support separate operator and 
administrator functions. The operator functions 
shall be restricted to those necessary for 
performing routine operations. The operator 
functions shall allow the enabling and disabling 
of peripheral devices, mounting of removable 
storage media, backing-up and recovering user 
objects; maintaining the TCB hardware and software 
elements (e.g., on-site testing); and starting and 
shutting down the system. The administrative 
functions shall support separate security 
administrator and auditor roles. The TCB shall 
enable the administrators to perform their 
functions only after taking distinct auditable 
action to assume an administrator role. Non-
security functions that can be performed in the 
security administrative role shall be limited 
strictly to those essential to performing the 
security role effectively.[SM-4]

5. 	 The use of the protected mechanisms for system 
administration shall be limited to authorized 
administrative users.

Requirements for Reference Mediation

RM-3 Mediation of References to Subject and Object 
Attributes

1. 	The TCB shall mediate all references to 
subjects, objects, resources, and services (e.g., 
TCB functions) described in the TCB 
specifications. The mediation shall ensure that 
all references are directed to the appropriate 
security-policy functions.

2. 	 Reference mediation shall include control of 
references to all subjects, objects, and resources 
protected under the TCB security policy, to their 
policy (i.e., access rights, security levels) and 
status attributes (e.g., existence, length, 
locking state).

3. 	References issued by privileged subjects shall 
be mediated in accordance with the policy 
attributes defined for those subjects.

Requirements for Logical TCB Protection

P-3 TCB Isolation and Timing Consistency

The TCB shall maintain a domain for its own 
execution that protects it from external 
interference and tampering (e.g., by reading or 
modification of its code and data structures). The 
protection of the TCB shall provide TCB isolation 
and noncircumventability of TCB isolation 
functions as follows:

	1. TCB Isolation requires that (1) the address 
spaces of the TCB and those of unprivileged 
subjects are separated such that users, or 
unprivileged subjects operating on their behalf, 
cannot read or modify TCB data structures or code, 
(2) the transfers between TCB and non-TCB domains 
are controlled such that arbitrary entry to or 
return from the TCB are not possible; and (3) the 
user or application parameters passed to the TCB 
by addresses are validated with respect to the TCB 
address space, and those passed by value are 
validated with respect to the values expected by 
the TCB.

	2. Non-circumventability of TCB isolation 
functions requires that the permission to objects 
(and/or to non-TCB data) passed as parameters to 
the TCB are validated with respect to the 
permissions required by the TCB, and references to 
TCB objects implementing TCB isolation functions 
are mediated by the TCB.

TCB protection shall also maintain the consistency 
of TCB global variables and eliminate undesirable 
dependencies of the TCB on unprivileged subject or 
user actions.

	3. Consistency of TCB global variables requires 
that consistency conditions defined over TCB 
internal variables, objects, and functions hold 
before and after any TCB invocation.

	4. Elimination of undesirable dependencies of 
the TCB on unprivileged subject actions requires 
that any TCB invocation by an unprivileged subject 
(or user) input to a TCB call may not place the TCB 
in a state such that it is unable to respond to 
communication initiated by other users.

Furthermore, TCB protection shall maintain the 
timing consistency of condition checks.

	5. Timing consistency of condition checks 
requires that a validation check holds at the 
instant when the TCB action depending on that 
check is performed.

Requirements for TCB Self Checking

SC-1 Minimal Self Checking

Hardware and/or software features shall be 
provided that can be used to periodically validate 
the correct operation of the on-site hardware and 
firmware elements of the TCB.

Requirements for TCB Start-Up and Recovery

TR-1 Minimal Requirements for Recovery or Start-up

Procedures and/or mechanisms shall be provided to 
assure that, after a TCB failure or other 
discontinuity, recovery without protection 
compromise is obtained.

Requirements for TCB Privileged Operation

PO-2 Privilege Association with TCB Modules

1. TCB privileges needed by individual functions, 
or groups of functions, of a functional component 
shall be identified. Privileged TCB calls or 
access to privileged TCB objects, such as user and 
group registration files, password files, security 
and integrity-level definition file, role 
definition file, audit-log file shall also be 
identified. It shall be possible to associate TCB 
privileges with TCB operations performed by 
administrative users. 

2.The modules of a TCB function shall be 
associated only with the privileges necessary to 
complete their task. 

3. Support for product privilege implementation 
and association with TCB modules provided by 
lower-level mechanisms or procedures (e.g., 
operating system, processors, language) shall be 
provided.

ASSURANCES 

Requirements for TCB Property Definition

PD-4 Formal Specification of TCB Properties

The developer shall provide formal models for the 
functional components and sub-components of the 
profile. At a minimum, a formal model of the 
access control components shall be provided. The 
properties of the formal models shall be clearly 
stated. The developer shall provide a formal 
interpretation of the models in the FIS of the 
product's TCB. For each model entity, the 
developer shall: (1) identify the TCB elements and 
their FIS (if any) that implement that entity; (2) 
specify the operation of these TCB elements, and 
(3) prove that the FIS of these elements is 
consistent with the model properties. The 
developer's interpretation of each formal model, 
which specifies the TCB properties, shall identify 
all TCB and FIS elements (if any) that do not 
correspond to any model entity and shall explain 
why these elements do not render the TCB 
properties invalid.

An informal model of reference mediation and TCB 
protection shall be provided. For the components 
that are not modeled, the developer shall 
interpret the functional requirements of the 
protection profile within the product TCB. For 
each functional requirement, the developer shall: 
(1) identify the TCB elements and their TCB 
interfaces (if any) that implement that 
requirement; (2) describe the operation of these 
TCB elements, and (3) explain why the operation of 
these elements is consistent with the functional 
requirement. The developer's interpretation of 
each functional requirement, which describes the 
TCB properties, shall include all the TCB 
elements.

Requirements for TCB Element Identification

ID-2: TCB Element Justification

The vendor shall identify the TCB elements (i.e., 
software, hardware/firmware code and data 
structures). Each element must be unambiguously 
identified by its name, type, release, and version 
number (if any).

The developer shall justify the protection 
relevance of the identified elements (i.e., only 
elements that can affect the correct operation of 
the protection functions shall be included in the 
TCB). If protection-irrelevant elements are 
included in the TCB, the developer shall provide a 
rationale for such inclusion.

Requirements for TCB Interface Definition

IF-3: Formal Interface Specification

The developer shall define all external (e.g., 
command, software, and I/O) administrative (i.e., 
privileged) and non-administrative interfaces to 
the TCB.

The developer shall provide and maintain a 
descriptive interface specification (DIS) of the 
TCB that completely and accurately describes the 
TCB in terms of exceptions, error messages, and 
effects. The DIS shall identify the TCB call 
conventions (e.g., parameter order, call sequence 
requirements), and exceptions signaled. The DIS 
shall also include the TCB call identifier, 
parameter types (e.g., input, output), the effect 
of the call, TCB call conventions (e.g., parameter 
order, call sequence requirements), and exceptions 
handled and signaled. It shall be shown to be an 
accurate description of the TCB interface.

A Formal Interface Specification (FIS) of the TCB 
shall be maintained that accurately describes the 
TCB in terms of the call identifier, parameter 
types (e.g., input, output), the effect of the 
call, TCB call conventions (e.g., parameter order, 
call sequence requirements), and exceptions 
signaled. 

The DIS and FIS shall include those components of 
the TCB that are implemented as hardware and/or 
firmware if their properties are visible at the 
TCB interface.

If the TCB consists of a kernel and privileged 
processes, the developer shall separately identify 
and define the interfaces for the kernel and each 
privileged process.

The TCB interface definition must also include all 
effects of a call including the direct visibility 
and alterability of internal TCB variables and 
functions.

Requirements for TCB Modular Decomposition

MD-3: Module Relationship Analysis

The developer shall design the TCB as a small 
number (e.g., 10 to 100) of design and 
implementation subsystems that have well-defined 
functional relationships and shared-data 
dependencies. The developer shall identify the 
specific TCB protection properties and functions 
associated with each subsystem and the TCB 
interfaces (if any) implemented by each subsystem.

The developer shall design each subsystem as a set 
of modules. For each module, the developer shall 
describe: the role or purpose of the module, the 
set of related functions performed by the module, 
and the module interface (i.e., the set of 
invocable functions, calling conventions, 
parameters, global variables, and results). The 
developer shall identify the protection functions 
of, and describe the interfaces between, these 
modules. The developer shall choose the modules so 
that the set of functions implemented by the 
module, the module's contribution to the TCB 
protection properties, and the interface(s) to the 
module can be described concisely (e.g., the 
module shall have a single purpose).   The TCB 
structuring into modules shall be based on well-
defined module relationships; for example, the 
contains relation (e.g., A is part of B), the 
"uses" relation (e.g., A is correct only if B is 
correct). The developer shall analyze the 
correctness dependencies among these modules. This 
analysis may include, but is not restricted to, 
service and environmental dependencies.

Requirements for TCB Structuring Support

SP-3: Structured Protection Mechanisms

The TCB shall maintain process isolation. The TCB 
shall separate those elements that are protection-
critical from those that are not. Features in 
hardware, such as segmentation, shall be used to 
support logically distinct storage objects with 
separate access-control attributes (e.g., 
readable, writable). The TCB shall employ a 
complete, conceptually simple, protection 
mechanism with precisely defined semantics. This

the complexity of the TCB. System engineering 
shall be directed towards excluding from the TCB 
modules that are not protection critical.

The TCB design shall reflect use of modern 
software engineering techniques), such as data 
hiding and abstraction (i.e., data, functional, 
and control abstractions) and well-defined 
exception-handling. The TCB design shall also 
include use of layering (including a rationale for 
each layering violation), high-level 
synchronization constructs, and multi-tasking/
multi-threading.

that all claimed protection functions work as 
stated in the TCB interface description or 
specification. The tests shall exercise the 
boundary conditions of the protection functions. 
The developer shall generate the test conditions 
and data from the Descriptive Interface 
Specification(s). The developer test procedures 
shall include the tests used to demonstrate the 
absence of all flaws discovered in previous 
versions of the TCB.

The developer shall define the TCB configuration, 
interface, and protection functions that are 
subject to penetration testing. For each test, the 
developer shall identify the goal of the test and 
the criteria for successful penetration. The 
developer shall illustrate how, in addition to 
system reference manuals and TCB interface 
description, the DIS, source code, and hardware 
and firmware specifications are used to define

developer shall document all test conditions, data 
(e.g., test set-up, function call parameters, and 
test outcomes), and coverage. 

The developer shall generate the test conditions 
from flaw-hypotheses derived by negating 
assertions of TCB design capabilities and by 
providing counter examples that show that these 
assertions are false. The developer shall confirm 
the flaw hypotheses by checking design and 
implementation documentation, by defining the test 
data and running test programs, or by referring to 
known classes of penetration flaws found in other 
TCBs. The refutation of any hypothesis shall be

For each uncovered flaw, the developer shall 
define and document scenarios of flaw exploitation 
and shall identify all penetration outcomes

identification method includes source code and 
hardware analysis.    The developer shall define 
the identification method used. The developer 
shall define the identification method used. The 
developer shall demonstrate that the chosen 
identification method is sound (e.g., it leads to 
the discovery of all covert channels in the FIS or

identify all functions that provide independent 
sources of timing (e.g., CPUs, I/O processors). 

 2. Bandwidth Measurement or Engineering 
Estimation: The developer shall define the method 
used for covert-channel bandwidth estimation. The 
method shall be based on information theory 
methods. In measuring TCB performance for covert-
channel-bandwidth estimation, the developer shall 
satisfy the following assumptions. The maximum 
bandwidth estimation shall be based on the 
assumptions that the covert channel is noiseless, 
that the senders and receivers are not delayed by 
the presence of other processes in the product, 
and that the sender-receiver synchronization time 
is negligible. 

The developer shall select TCB primitives to be 
measured for bandwidth determination from real 
scenarios of covert channel use. The developer 
shall specify TCB measurement environment for the 
bandwidth measurements. This specification shall

(2) the product configuration, (3) the sizes of 
the memory and cache components, and (4) the 
product initialization. The sensitivity of the 
measurement results to configuration changes shall 
be documented. The covert-channel measurements 
shall include the fastest TCB function calls for 
altering, viewing, and setting up the transmission 
environment; the demonstrably fastest process 
(context) switch time shall also be included in 
the bandwidth measurements. All measurements shall 
be repeatable.

to determine whether the handling functions work 
as intended.

security services (e.g., Access Control, System 
Entry, or Audit) to enforce a system security 
policy. The Trusted Facility Manual shall include 
the procedures for securely configuring, starting, 
maintaining, and halting the TCB. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall explain how to analyze audit 
data generated by the TCB to identify and document 
user and administrator violations of this policy. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall explain the 
unique security-relevant privileges and functions 
of administrators and operators. The Trusted 
Facility Manual shall also explain the distinct 
security-relevant privileges and functions of the 
TCB and how they can be selectively granted to 
provide fine-grained, multi-person or multi-role 
system and application administration policies. 
The Trusted Facility Manual shall describe the 
administrative interaction between security 
services.

The Trusted Facility Manual shall identify all 
hardware, firmware, software, and data structures 
comprising the TCB. The detailed audit record 
structure for each type of audit event shall be 
described. The Trusted Facility Manual shall 
explain how configure the product to mitigate, 
eliminate, or audit their exploitation. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall describe the 
cautions about and procedures for using the TCB as 
a base for site-specific secure applications. The 
Trusted Facility Manual shall describe procedures 
for securely regenerating the TCB after any part 
is changed (e.g., due to adding devices or 
installing flaw corrections to the TCB software).

The Trusted Facility Manual shall be distinct from 
User Guidance, and encompass any administrative 
responsibilities identified in security 
management.

Requirements for Trusted Generation

TG-3: Trusted Generation With Secure State Review

The developer shall establish and document the 
procedures that a consumer must perform to 
generate an operational TCB from the delivered 
copy of the master TCB. The consumer documentation 
shall identify any system parameters, which are 
initialized or set during system generation, that 
affect the TCB's conformance to the protection 
profile and state the acceptable ranges of values 
for those parameters. The product shall be 
delivered with each of these parameters set to its 
fail-safe defaults. The developer shall provide 
the consumer with a capability to review the 
product security state (e.g., by providing a 
program, which could be executed after generating 
and starting the TCB, that determines the 
consistency of the protection-relevant 
parameters).

Requirements for Life Cycle Definition

LC-3: Measurable Life Cycle Process

engineering process standard. The process shall 
incorporate a security policy that states the 
technical, physical, procedural, personnel, and 
other measures used by the developer to protect 
the product and its documentation. The developer 
shall demonstrate that each development process 
and support process requirement of the protection 
profile is satisfied by some part, or parts, of 
the developer's process. The developer shall 
identify the programming languages used to develop 
the TCB software and reference the definitions of 
those languages. The developer shall identify any 
implementation dependent options of the 
programming language compiler(s) used to implement 
the TCB software and reference the definitions of 
those languages.The developer shall describe 
coding standards followed during the 
implementation of the product and shall ensure 
that all source code complies with these 
standards.

Requirements for Configuration Management

CM-4: Extended Configuration Management

The developer shall establish configuration 
control and generation procedures employing 
automated tools for developing and maintaining the 
TCB. The procedures shall be employed to ensure 
that all changes to the TCB are consistent with 
the product's protection properties and security 
policy. The developer shall employ these tools to 
track and control changes to development evidence, 
implementation data (e.g., source code and 
hardware diagrams), executable versions of the 
TCB, test documentation and procedures, identified 
flaws, and consumer documentation. The procedures 
shall include a formal acceptance process for 
protection-relevant changes.

The configuration control procedures shall assure 
a consistent mapping among documentation and code 
associated with the current version of the TCB and 
permit the regeneration of any supported version 
of the TCB. The developer shall provide tools for 
the generation of a new version of the TCB from 
source code. Also, tools shall be available for 
comparing a newly generated version with the 
previous TCB version to ascertain that only the 
intended changes have been made in the code that 
will actually be used as the new version of the 
TCB. The developer shall use a combination of 
technical, physical, and procedural safeguards to 
protect the master copy or copies of all material 
used to generate the TCB from unauthorized 
modification or destruction.

Requirements for Trusted Distribution

TD-1: TCB Modification Detection During Distribution

The developer shall establish procedures and

modifications to any TCB-related software, 
firmware, and hardware, including updates, that is 
transferred from the development environment to a 
consumer's site. 

Requirements for Evidence of TCB Protection Properties

EPP-4 Evidence of Formal Model Interpretation in the FIS

The developer shall provide documentation which 
describes the correspondence between the 
functional component requirements and the TCB 
elements and interfaces. This documentation shall 
describe how the TCB implements the reference 
monitor concept. The developer shall also provide 
a formal access-control model and an informal 
reference mediation and TCB protection model. The 
TCB properties, which are defined by this 
correspondence and the interpretation of these 
models within the DIS and FIS of the TCB shall be 
documented by the product developer.

Requirements for Evidence of Product Development

EPD-5: Policy Consistency Of The FIS

The developer shall provide a Descriptive 
Interface Specification (DIS) that describes the 
functions, effects, exceptions and error messages

convincing argument that the DIS is consistent 
with the formal model of the policy. The developer 
shall show that the DIS is an accurate 
representation of the TCB's external interfaces.

The developer shall provide a Formal Interface 
Specification (FIS) that rigorously defines the 
protection functions available at the TCB 
interface in terms of: the protection properties 
implemented by each function, the precise 
semantics for invoking each function, the effects 
of each function (i.e., returned values and effect 
on the TCB state), and the possible exceptions and 
error messages returned by each function. The FIS 
shall be accompanied by a convincing argument that 
it is consistent with the formal model of the 
product protection policy. This argument shall be 
constructed using both manual and machine-assisted 
specification and verification methods. Machine-
assisted specification and verification methods 
shall be approved by the product evaluation 
authority.

The developer shall provide TCB Design 
Specifications that include: a list of the TCB 
elements (hardware, software, and firmware 
configuration items); a list of protection 
services provided to the TCB by hardware, 
software, and firmware that is not part of the 
TCB; an explanation of the techniques and criteria 
used during the modular decomposition of the TCB; 
a description of the policy allocations, 
functions, and interactions among the major TCB 
subsystems; module level descriptions of all 
software and hardware in the TCB; and an argument 
that the design implements exactly the functions 
specified in the FIS.

The developer shall provide TCB Implementation 
Data consisting of the engineering diagrams for 
all hardware included in the TCB and the source 
code used to generate the TCB software and 
firmware. The developer shall show, through either 
manual or machine-assisted correspondence methods, 
that the TCB software, firmware, and hardware 
implement the documented TCB design.

Requirements for Evidence of Functional Testing

EFT-3: Evidence of Specification-Driven Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of the 
functional testing that includes the test plan, 
the test procedures, and the results of the 
functional testing. The test, plans, procedures, 
and results shall be maintained under the same 
configuration control as the TCB software. The 
test plans shall identify the TCB specification 
used in the derivation of the test conditions, 
data, and coverage analysis.

EPA-2: Evidence of Flaw-Hypothesis Generation and Testing

The developer shall provide evidence of 
penetration testing. The penetration evidence 
shall identify all product documentation and 
development evidence on which the search for flaws 
was based. The penetration evidence shall describe 
the scenarios for exploiting each potential flaw 
in the system and the penetration test conditions, 
data (e.g., test set-up, function call parameters, 
and test outcomes), coverage, and conclusions 
derived from each scenario. The penetration 
evidence shall summarize both refuted and 
confirmed flaws hypothesis.

Requirements for Evidence of Covert Channel Analysis

ECC-2: Evidence of Covert Channel Analysis and Handling

The developer's documentation shall present the 
results of the covert channel analysis and the 
trade-offs involved in restricting these channels. 
All auditable events that may be used in the 
exploitation of known covert channels shall be 
identified. The developer shall provide the 
bandwidths of known covert channels whose use is 
not detectable by the auditing mechanism. The 
documentation of each identified covert channel 
shall consist of the variables, timing sources, 
and the TCB interface functions that can be used 
to transmit information. The measurements of each 
TCB function call used by covert channels must be 
documented and the bandwidth computation shall be 
included for each channel. The measurement 
environment should be documented as specified. 
Test documentation shall include results of 
testing the effectiveness of the methods used to 
reduce covert-channel bandwidths.

Requirements for Evidence of Product Support

EPS-3: Evidence of Measured Product Support

The developer shall provide documentation that 
defines, explains, and justifies the policies, 
procedures, plans, and tools established by the 
developer to satisfy the Operational Support and 
Development Environment requirements of the 
protection profile. The documentation shall also 
explain how the developer periodically evaluates 
compliance with the established procedures, 
policies, and plans.

Requirements for Test Analysis

TA-5: Formal Test Analysis

The evaluator shall assess whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for functional testing and 
penetration analysis, and whether the producer has 
documented these activities as defined in the 
development evidence requirements of the 
protection profile. The evaluator shall analyze 
the results of the producer's testing activities 
for completeness of coverage and consistency of 
results, and general correctness (e.g., defect 
trend from regression testing). This analysis 
shall examine the testability of requirements, use 
of the FIS for test derivation, the adequacy of 
the tests to measure the required properties, the 
deviation of the actual results obtained from the 
expected results. The analysis shall extend to 
trace all defects identified, corrected, and 
retested. The analysis shall include an assessment 
of test coverage and completeness, and defect 
frequency. The results of testing shall be 
interpreted in terms that express product 
performance and protection adequacy. The evaluator 
shall determine whether the product's protection 
properties, as defined for the entire TCB, and all 
relevant known penetration flaws have been tested. 
The evaluator shall independently develop, test, 
and document additional flaw hypotheses. The 
evaluator shall assess testing results to 
determine whether the product's TCB works as 
claimed, that the TCB's implementation is 
consistent with the FIS, and whether there are any 
obvious ways (i.e., ways that are known, or that 
are readily apparent or easily discovered in 
product documentation) for an unauthorized user to 
bypass the policy implemented by the TCB or 
otherwise defeat the product's TCB, and whether 
all discovered TCB flaws have been corrected and 
no new TCB flaws introduced. No design flaws and 
no more than a few correctable implementation 
flaws may be found during testing and there shall 
be reasonable confidence that few remain.   If 
covert channel handling methods have been 
implemented, the testing results shall show that 
the methods used to reduce covert channel 
bandwidths have been effective for all evaluated 
configurations. The evaluator shall determine 
whether the product is completely resistant to 
penetrations.

 IT-4: Formal Independent Testing.

The evaluator shall independently perform 
functional and elementary penetration testing to 
confirm test results. This testing shall be based 
on (1) the results of producer or other 
independent testing, (2) the TCB's FIS, (3) the 
product's design and implementation documentation, 
(4) the product's user and administrative 
documentation, (5) relevant known penetration 
flaws, and (6) evaluator-developed TCB penetration 
flaw hypotheses and corresponding tests that 
attempt to exploit the hypothesized flaws. 
Satisfactory completion consists of demonstrating 
that all TCB functions work as described in the 
product's relevant documentation, that the TCB 
functions are consistent with the FIS, that test 
results are consistent, and that no discrepancies 
exist between the documentation and the product. 
Satisfactory penetration test completion shall be 
determined by the subjective judgement of the 
evaluator (which may be supported 
algorithmically). Test duration agreements may 
further constrain this judgement. Categorization 
of an actual penetration flaw shall be based on 
the reproducibility of that flaw. Flaws that are 
discovered, but are not reproducible shall remain 
categorized as potential penetration flaws. All 
actual penetration flaws must be corrected and 
retested. 

The evaluator shall provide a penetration test 
plan document that describes the additional 
evaluator-developed flaw hypotheses and associated 
tests. The evaluator shall execute these tests and 
shall report any discovered flaws to the producer 
as part of the testing results. At the conclusion 
of penetration testing, the evaluator shall 
provide copies of this penetration test plan and 
its test results to the producer. The producer 
shall ensure that this test plan and its test 
results are incorporated into the rest of the 
product's testing documentation and that such 
documentation is available for further analysis 
throughout the life of the product.

The evaluator shall test for covert channel 
bandwidth reductions to determine the 
effectiveness of handling method(s) in reducing 
the bandwidths of identified covert channels.

Requirements for Development Environment

DER-3: Comprehensive Development Environment Review

The evaluator shall review the producer's 
development and maintenance process description 
documentation and shall conduct a complete audit 
of the producer's processes using the evidence 
generated by each process to determine the degree 
of discipline enforced upon and within the 
process, and to determine the protection 
characteristics associated with the product's 
development and maintenance. The results of this 
review shall establish, for the evaluator, the 
producer's development environment, its policies, 
and the degree of enforcement maintained during 
development execution. The review shall also 
confirm the producer's complete conformance with 
all relevant development environment requirements.

Requirements for Operational Support

OSR-3 Comprehensive Operational Support Review

The evaluator shall review all documentation 
focused on the activities of product use (e.g., 
Users Manuals) and product administration 
including installation, operation, maintenance, 
and trusted recovery (e.g., Trusted Facility 
Management manuals. This review shall assess the 
clarity of presentation, difficulty in locating 
topics of interest, ease of understanding, and 
completeness of coverage. The need for separate 
manuals dedicated to protection-relevant aspects 
of the product should be assessed for 
effectiveness. The evaluator shall execute all 
documented protection-relevant features and 
procedures to determine if their descriptions are 
accurate and correct.

Requirements for Design Analysis

DA-3: Comprehensive Design Analysis

The evaluator shall determine whether the producer 
has performed the activities defined in the 
development process assurance requirements of the 
protection profile for TCB property definition and 
TCB design. The evaluator shall determine whether 
the producer has documented these activities as 
defined in the development evidence requirements 
of the protection profile. The evaluator shall 
analyze, with the help of formal methods and 
appropriate automated tools, the results of the 
producer's activities for completeness, 
consistency, and correctness of design with 
respect to requirements (e.g., validating the 
formal verification of the design).

Requirements for Implementation

CI-3: Comprehensive Implementation Analysis

The evaluator shall conduct an inspection on a 
moderate sample of randomly selected product code. 
The assessment shall focus on the clarity of the 
coding style, adherence to coding standards, 
coding documentation, and on possible software 
defects that may be present with respect to the 
product's formal design and model. The inspection 
shall be performed to obtain only a sample of 
possible software defects, not to capture all such 
possible defects. The evaluator shall report all 
discovered defects to the producer; the assessment 
shall report the number of defects found per line 
of code inspected from the random sample size. Use 
of producer-provided code inspection results can 
supplement this inspection. All trapdoors built 
into the product for maintenance purposes shall be 
identified by the producer and shown to be 
protected by the product. The producer shall 
correct all discovered defects and the corrected 
software reinspected. A rigorous analysis of the 
implementation's correspondence to the verified 
design shall be performed by the evaluator to 
validate correctness. Such analysis may be 
supported by appropriate automated tools.
