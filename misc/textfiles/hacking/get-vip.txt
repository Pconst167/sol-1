.Introduction
GET-VIP means Getting_Very_Important_Persons_from_Unix-Passwd-Files.
You know the problem as a real internet hacker. You get loads of passwd files.
You have got so many accounts, and most are only crappy users, students and
so one. Okay, you can use many of those accounts to make tracing your hacks
more difficult. But you don't need them - so why crack them?
Interesting users - that's what a real hacker is searching for - and this is
the utility to help you.

.Whats new?
-> Go to the end of this document and look at the history <-

.What are VIPs on the Internet?
A VIP is someone with an greater access level to a system than the normal
user. VIPs are doctors and professors who may have their researchfiles
online. VIPs are persons, who have access to more servers than their home-
server, those are people with the great .rlogin files.
And these are the people with interesting files and messages.

.What does GET-VIP
GET-VIP examine those passwd files and write the VIPs into an output file.
from 2000 accounts this will be 20-50. You see it? You can now concentrate
on hacking these accounts, you save time and time and time and time and ...

.The Commandline Options
To get a onlinehelp, just type get-vip, or get-vip -?, or get-vip ? and so on.

Syntax  : GET-VIP.EXE <passwdfile>
Options : [<outputfile>] [G:<groupfile>] [-Gn] [-{n/N}n}]/[-O] [-C] [-S] [-R]

Parameters :
<passwdfile>  This is the passwd-file you want to examine for VIPs


Optional Parameters :
<outputfile>   Output file. If not specified, it`s vip.out

G:<groupfile>  The Groupfile found in /etc, named group. get-vip scans it
               and adds users with interesting groups into the VIP class.
               You must not have this file to run get-vip, but it's better
               for you if you have it ;-)  VERY GOOD if you do that !

-G<numbers>    Groupnumbers you wish to include the users from.
               Seperate character is , f.e. -G0,1,2,3 but can use any
               character you want to seperate them EXCEPT space and numbers
               (obviously). Every good hacker should use this possibility
               and not rely on the scanning of the group file from get-vip.
               A human mind can decide better, which group is interesting.
               You CAN put both options together, -G and G:<file> but if you
               use the -G option, why should you do that?

-{N/n}<number> The numbers of users you wish to have in your output file
               First get-vip gets all interesting groups and names and logins
               relating accounts out of the passwd file. After that, the
               specifies number of users will be added. Because a passwd file
               is unsorted, the first/oldest users of a system are on top.
               One possibility, the accounts aren't used anymore, or these
               are accounts from profs, administrators, doctors, system or
               high qualified students. If not specified, 100 users will be
               added with the SOFT option.
               `N` means it`s STRICT, there will only be as much users added
               from top of the passwd file until the number is equal the
               whole users in the output file. If there are already more VIPs
               than the specified number, than no users will be added, and NO
               VIPs will be deleted to fit the list!
               'n' means it`s SOFT, there will always be the specified number
               of users added.
               Get-vip makes sure, that no account is more than one time in
               the output list. The number specified must be between 0 and
               5000 <-- think of that.

-O             Turn Options n/N OFF, no extra accounts are copied! If you
               don't supply this option, then always 100 accounts are copied.
               If you only want do break those identified accounts, use this
               option.

-S             Only choosen accounts with shells are copied to the outputfile.
               Very good, cause often admin accounts point to run-only
               programs. So don't bother with them.

-C             Convert the output file to the DOS Textformat with carriage
               return and linefeed.

-R             This copies ALL valid accounts from the passwd file. This means
               it cancels ALL other options, it DOESN'T generate a vip file !
               it does so to something like a slim trimmer to the file. Only
               the -S option can be used together with this option to generate
               a new passwd file with only the valid accounts which've got a
               shell.

Options mentioned with the `-` sign : you may also use a `/` ...

Examples : (all these examples are valid!)
GET-VIP passwd.ffm passwd.go G:group -n250 -C -O
GET-VIP hidden.out crack.it -g1,3:4;145 -N50 -S
GET-VIP a b /G:group.txt /g27+1
GET-VIP passwd

I recommend : (you must get the /etc/group file for that, if not then just
               leave the G: option away ... )
GET-VIP passwd passwd.vip G:group -O -S

For the following keywords will be searched in the geco & login field :
WHEEL, DAEMO, UUC, STAFF, WWW, NEWS, PROF, DR, DOC, OPERAT, HACK, CRACK,
ANALY, WISSENSCH, SEARCH, SCIENCE, ADM, BIN, ROOT, SYS, UNIX, INUX, MANAG
It's not casesensitive, for the term "DR" there are also special checks.
As you can see, a user named "radman" in the login field will be VIP cause
there's "ADM" in the name. So check your vip file to make it smaller.



.Conclusion
That's something to help you. Get this and be happy with it.
It is not a great software, which no one can produce - but nobody has done
it before.

Real hackers rely on their brain, not their machines.

.History
Version 1.0· released   24 April 95
        1st public release
Version 1.1· released    1 July  95 (i've got many private projects so no time)
        -S Shell Option added    (<- very important!)
        -N updated to 5000 accounts (from 4000)
        Accounts with groupnumber or accountnumber 0 are automatically added
        Now supports password-aging
        removed two small bug ...
Version 1.2Ê released   1 August 95
        -R Option added (useful!) something like a passwd slim trimmer
        added an option display for -S
        fixed a very small bug (nah not a bug just cosmetics) ;)
Version 1.2thc released   1 October 95
        I hadn't got the time to program more on that project, 'cause i've got
        3 others at the moment, but the work will be continued!
        I only did a small bug fix and some output cosmetics.
        This is so to say a re-release because the groups LORE & DTI joined
        together to the group THC -> The Hacker's Choice    which will be
        the best HP release group until the end of '95 ... with programs
        for every computer type like the fastest Unix Passwd cracker for
        the amiga, Dictionary generators, BB Dialers, Login Hackers etc.
        So look out for that on all the Dist. Sites mentioned in the
        THC.NFO file.



.Future
If there is the demand for it i'll put in these options :
 - extract users with data in their login/geco field via an external control
   file. So you could decide for which accounts to look for.
 - Full Trim Option, deletes all daty in Geco, shell, path field. that will
   cut the size by 2 of the passwd file. Passwd cracker will be a slight faster
 - Amiga Version ?
So tell me if ya want these features, or if you want any others ...


Have PHUN!
