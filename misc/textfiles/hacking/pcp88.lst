                            PCP List v1.1 - 8/31/88

 Introduction:

     What is PCP?  PCP stands for PC Pursuit.  This is an online service which
  for a nominal fee allows you to call almost anywhere in the continential US.
  The main restriction is that you must call via data, i.e. a modem.  What you
  must do is call the node nearest you and then follow the instructions in the
  next section.

  Instructions:

        When you connect with the TeleNet node type "@<CR>" (<CR> stands for
  Carriage Return).  Hit return until you get the prompt "@".  This is the
  telenet prompt.  At the telenet prompt you may do one of the following:

        1> Hang-Up.  Simply type "HANG<CR>"

        2> Connect with an outdial.

        3> Disconnect with an outdial.  Simply type "D<CR>"

        4> Use the various set commands.  (This will be covered in the
           next issue of PCP list)

  Connecting with an Outdial:

        At the "@" prompt type the following:

                C D/XXXXX/YY,PCPZZZZZ

        XXXXX = Outdial Specifier (PCP on the lisings)
        YY = Baud Rate
        ZZZZZ = Your PCP User Number

        You will then be prompted for you password.  If the password is
        correct you will be given one of the following:

       D/XXXXX,YY BUSY 00 00  (The Outdial is busy)
                      (^^ ^^ these vary)

       D/XXXXX,YY CONNECTED   (You are connected to the Outdial)

       D/XXXXX,YY NOT OPERATING 00 00  (The Outdial is under repair)

  Once connected to an Outdial you must type: "ATZ<CR>" "<Control-E><CR>"

  You should then get the "*" prompt from here you can do 5 things:

        1> Dial.  Simply type "D,NNNNNNN<CR>"  (NNNNNNN = Phone Number)

        2> Re-Dial. Simply type "R<CR>".  You will be prompted for # of
           redials.

        3> Return to the TeleNet Prompt.  Simple type "@<CR>"

        4> Get a menu. Simply type "?<CR>".

        5> Set parameters.  Type "O<CR>".
           (If you know how to use these, please leave me mail on one
            of the boards listed at the end.)

                 That's it!!  Hope this helps all of you out!!
