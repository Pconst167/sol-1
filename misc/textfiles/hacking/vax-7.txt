        ===================

           Occasionally  you will run across a BIG directory.  This  will
        hopefully  not  happen until you read more on VAX  on  my  WHAT'S
        HACKING sub boards, but if it does, this list will hopefully help
        you avoid making too big a mistake or wasting a lot of time.
