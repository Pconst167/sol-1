WHAT IS KEYTRAP ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
KEYTRAP is a very effective keyboard key logger that will log
keyboard scancodes to a logfile for later conversion to ASCII
characters. Keytrap installs as a TSR, remaining in memory
untill the computer is turned off. Keytrap will NOT work while
you are in windows.

CONVERT will convert the keyboard scancodes captured by Keytrap
to their respective keyboard (ASCII) characters. Convert is now
written in C. Source code is included.


NOTES
~~~~~
Both programs were coded so any modifications to the source codes
could EASILY be made. Both programs are HIGHLY configureable. They
can be easily changed to fit almost ANY dos application you need.
The TSR (Keytrap) is VERY powerful, it will capture keys during
almost anything you run. There are very few ways to defeat it.

Keytrap uses interrupts 9 and 21. Keytraps interrupt 9 ISR is checked
via the interrupt 21 ISR and replaced if need be. You can easily add
many more 9 ISR's if a program decides to take full control of the
9 ISR more then twice, which is VERY unlikely. Very few programs take
full control of ISR 9.

Keytrap will not display ANY messages. Check the logfile and 
the size of the logfile if your not sure Keytrap is working. 

Keytrap will only make the logfile hidden if the logfile is
actually created by Keytrap or the maximum size of the logfile
is reached or exceeded. If you specify a file that already
exists then Keytrap will not change that files attributes and 
will append all scancode data to the end of the file.
 
Keytrap will not crash if the logfile gets deleted while Keytrap
is in memory. It will just keep looking for the logfile so it can
write its buffer. A buffer write is not forced untill the buffer
reaches 400 bytes. It will then try to write its buffer during 
the next interrupt 21 call.
