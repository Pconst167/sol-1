A. NOTES
========
	This FAQ deals primarily with defeating security programs for
the Macintosh, but there is a lot of room for expansion. If you have
any hacks for Mac security programs, ideas for extending the scope of
the FAQ or any other feedback, send mail to the faq-maintainer, AX1P
at: an149689@anon.penet.fi. Right now I am interested in steering the FAQ
towards defeating password protection for various compression programs and
defeating copy protection so send in those submissions. I also would
like to thank Bubba "Anderson" Sanchez, III esq. for writing the entire
article on bypassing HD driver protection. And thank you to everyone
who submitted their hacks and encouragement.

COMMON SENSE DISCLAIMER:
I can not held responsible for any damage that might occur from
experimenting with the techniques herein. Some may be completely wrong,
others may only work on certain macs and particular versions of
software. If you screw something up, it's your ass. Run like hell and/or 
play computer illiterate. I do not support breaking laws of any
race, creed or short-sightedness... 


B. WHAT ARE THE GENERAL TECHNIQUES FOR BYPASSING MAC SECURITY MEASURES?
=======================================================================
*** Disable System Extensions by holding down the Shift-key during
    start-up. This is one of the easiest techniques but you would be
    surprised how often it works! On Classics, try booting up off the
    ROM disk by holding down Command-Option-x-o during boot-up.
*** Find the Finder. On some "secured" systems, you can gain access to
    locked folders if you now the name of an unlocked file within. For
    example, here is a FoolProof hack:
	1) Search for the word 'finder'(a file we know is in the locked system
	   folder).
	2) The locked file opens to display the Finder file. From
	   here, you can now move the FoolProof Preferences and
	   Extensions out of the system folder.
	3) Reboot.
*** Break into the debugger by hitting the programmer's switch or the
    Command-Power key combo. Then type 'G FINDER', or 'G F'. You can
    also get to the debugger by holding down the control-command-power
    key combo and restarting.
*** Crash the system! In some older security programs, you can get to the
    finder by repeatedly opening applications until all the RAM is consumed.
    Older versions of At Ease will open a dialogue box that asks if you
    would like to quit At Ease to free up RAM. Click yes! 
*** Boot from a floppy. Even if your sysadmin has floppy startup
    disabled, you should be able to force it by holding down the
    command-option-shift-delete key combo to boot the floppy. This key
    combo won't let the internal hard drive mount 
*** Plug an external hard drive into the SCSI port. Even if your
    sysadmin has disabled floppy access and starting up without extensions
you
    can copy any programs on the drive if you know any of the passwords.
*** Social engineering is almost too obvious (and cliche) to mention,
    but it seems to work. Remember to act computer stupid and/or get
    really pissy.


C. WHAT DO I DO AFTER I GET TO THE FINDER?
==========================================
	So you have finally found the finder...now what? Now you can
run any programs you want, but why not make things easier on yourself
for your next trip to the finder. If you know that your sysadmin keeps
logs:
	1) Copy the system folder to the hard drive.
	2) Rename the original system folder.
	3) Reboot without At Ease.
	4) When you are done, put the real system folder back and
	   delete the second one.

If you aren't concerned about logs, just move the At Ease Preferences
out of the System Folder:Extensions folder and reboot. Remember to put
them back when you are done. The logs have been bypassed but you really
don't care to be rebooting over and over while the lab monitor glares
at you. It would be much better to have the system supervisor's
password so you can switch back and forth between At Ease and the
finder at will. The easiest way is to install a keygrabber, which is a
system extension that logs and captures all the keystrokes on the
computer. Oasis is a good keygrabber for the mac that can be found on
the internet or alt.2600. Unfortunately it has no documentation. To
use it:
	1) Get into the Finder and copy Oasis into the folder:
	   	System Folder:Extensions
	2) Wait a few days. 
	3) Look for the logfiles in:
 		System Folder:Preferences:~Temporary Folder.

Another keygrabber that is easier to find is MacLifeInsurance. You will have
to weed through several hundred pages of inane poetry, reports and e-mail
to Grandma but eventually one will have the password. If there are large 
number of users, you may be able to add your own account and password
with the supervisor's password. Use your discretion. And look for
those keygrabbers on local boards and ftp sites.


D. HOW DO I BYPASS HARD DISK DRIVER PROTECTION (for example: FileGuard's
   Volume Protection)? 
========================================================================
	Hard disk protection lies in a hard disk's driver code, at a
very low level on the disk. This protection is provided by most third
party hard disk formatting software or elaborate security
software(like FileGuard). Here's a quick guide to permanently removing
this protection:
	1) Get a high density disk. Install some startup software for
	   the machine in question. Install some disk formatting software that
	   lets you install new drivers (like Gold Triangle; maybe
	   even 'Apple HD SC Setup').
	2) Reboot machine. Quickly insert the floppy disk and then
	   hold down command-option-shift-delete. This prevents the
	   SCSI Bus from trying to mount the internal hard disk.
	3) When the finder loads, run disk formatting software. If you
	   want to trash the contents of the hard disk, just re-format
	   the disk. If you want to get at the contents, install a new
	   driver over the old driver (consult your software manual).

	If you need to diasable additional security at the hard disk,
	go to 4). Else, go to 5).

	4) Reboot machine; boot from floppy again. This time, let the
	   hard disk mount. If all went well, no password will be prompted for
	   here. When finder loads, remove the security inits/cdevs/programs.
	5) Reboot machine; boot from hard disk. No password should be
	   prompted for, and life should go on as usual.

NOTE: This process will probably cause the hard disk to crash severely
in the future!!! Only do this if there is something you really need on
the disk. After you copy the needed files to a different place, you
should REFORMAT THE HARD DISK.

This has been tested with FileGuard protection using Golden Triangler.
The tester backed up the source code he was working on, and then continued
using the machine(llsi). The machine crashed within an hour.


E. MISCELLANEOUS HACKS AND INFO
===============================
Q: HOW DO I COPY A READ-ONLY FILE?
A: Many utilities allow you to copy read-only files, including
StuffIt, Compact Pro, etc.

Q: HOW DO I ACCESS THE CHOOSER WHEN IT IS PROTECTED ON FOOLPROOF?
A: First try the default password 'foolproof'; Yes, some sysadmins are
that dumb. If it doesn't work, try this:
   1) Make a copy of the chooser.
   2) Use ResEdit or another resource editor to change the creator
      code from 'dfil chzr' 'dfil keyc'.
   3) The default password is reset to 'foolproof'.
   4) Swap the original chooser with the modified copy. Remember to
      cover your tracks and replace the original chooser when you are done.
NOTE: Make sure you work on copies when using ResEdit, especially when
you are using someone else's computer.

Q: HOW DO I DEFEAT FILEGUARD'S ENCRYPTION?
A: 1) Use FileGuard to encrypt or copyguard a file with the password
      'test', for example.
   2) Use ResEdit to copy the resource 'high' from that file.
   3) Paste it into the file that contains the unknown password.
   4) Save changes and quit.
   5) Decrypt the modified file with FileGuard using the password
      'test'.

Q: WHERE CAN I GET THE LATEST VERSION OF MACPGP AND THE SOURCE CODE?
A: Telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and login as 'getpgp'. You will have to
answer four short questions to get the name of the file it is in(the
name changes every half hour). Then ftp there and go to the specified
directory. The current version is MACPGP2.6.2. You should also get the
README files as the interface barely follows the Macintosh Interface
Guidelines.

Q: HOW DO I SET A NULL PASSWORD FOR AT EASE(not all versions)?
A: 1) Open the file System Folder:At Ease:At Ease Preferences with
      MSWord or any other text editor.
   2) Look for the string "MFDR\     ]".
   3) Delete everything between "\" and "]".
   4) Save the changes and you have a null password.
Now you can go to At Ease Setup and change the password to whatever
you want!

Q: WHAT DO I DO IF I FORGET THE ADMINISTRATOR'S PASSWORD[in At Ease]?
A: <excerpt from the At Ease for Workgroups 2.0.1 update help files>

"IF YOU FORGET THE ADMINISTRATOR'S PASSWORD

If you forget the At Ease administrator's password, follow the
directions below instead of those in the manual. If your startup disk
is locked, you'll first need to run the Unlock application on the AT
Ease 2.0 Utilities disk to unlock the start-up disk. Consult the
manual for information about the Unlock application.

1. Start up your computer from another startup disk.
[...BS...]
2. Open the System Folder of your usual startup disk.
3. Open the At Ease Items folder inside your System Folder.
4. Drag the At Ease Preferences file into the trash.
5. Hold down the Option key while you choose Empty Trash from the
   Special menu.
6. Restart from your usual startup disk.
7. Open the At Ease Setup for Workgroups aplication.

If you are using an AppleShare server volume as the At Ease disk, your
setups may not appear until you reset the At Ease disk to this server
volume.

8. Reconnect to the server volume and use the At Ease Disk command to
reselect the volume.

Make sure you use the information on the server instead of replacing
it with the information on the startup disk.

9. Add a new password and clue.
10. Make sure the following options set correctly:
    * Allow Remote Administration checkbox
    * Lock Startup Volume checkbox
11. Turn At Ease back on.
12. Quit At Ease Setup for Workgroups."

>> Where do you get the Unlock application? Beats the hell out of me.


F. RELATED ANONYMOUS FTP SITES
==============================
	There seems to be a serious lack of accessible FTP sites that
carry Macintosh hacking utensils, etc. I have hardly found any that I
can post. If you have a site to add to this list or you are interested
in creating a Mac Hack FTP site, please contact an149689@anon.penet.fi

* SITE: net-dist.mit.edu
* PATH: ?
* FILES: MacPGP2.6, MacPGP2.6 source code 
To get the path, you must telnet to net-dist.mit.edu and login as
'getpgp'. You will have to answer four short questions to get the name
of the directory it is in(the name changes every half hour). You
should get the README file as the interface barely follows the
Macintosh Interface Guidelines.

* SITE: ftp.netcom.com
* PATH: /pub/bradleym
* FILES: MacRedBox, VirtualQuarter, ...
Not much in the way of a Mac ftp site but it has four or five phreak
utilities.

* SITE: sekurity.com
* PATH: /pub/incoming
* FILES: unknown
Sometimes they have mac stuff. They used to have Oasis... Just look
for the familiar .hqx or .sit suffixes.
