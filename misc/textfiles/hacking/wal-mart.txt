			HACKING THE WAL-MART ARMORGUARD
			COMPUTER PROTECTION SYSTEM.

	***NOTE***
	To use this, you must have a system disk (i.e. a disk that has been
formatted using [format a: /s]) in 3.5" format under Windows 95, because that
is what they sell all of their computers with.

	***NOTE***
	In this file, instructions to be input into the computer are surrounded
by [ and ].  Keys are surrounded by < and >.  So if I say "hit [<CTRL>-<F1>] I
mean to hold down the control button and hit F1.

	The armorguard is a program that prevents you from writing to the
directories, changing the attributes of files, and deleting files.  It 
basically prevents you from doing anything cool.

	The first thing to do is to go into Wal-Mart.  Now, go to the 
computer section and turn off the screen saver.  Shut down as many apps as
you can with the [<CTRL>-<ALT>-<DEL>] and then choosing a program and 
hitting enter.  You cannot simply do this to the ArmorGuard program.  

	The next thing to do is to go to the DOS PROMPT.  Most Wal-Marts
take the mouse ball out of all of the display mice to make it harder to 
control the system.  If you are adept at putting your finger inside the mouse
and controlling it that way, fine.  Otherwise, just hit [<CTRL>-<ALT>-<ESC>].
This activates the start menu.  Select "Programs", hit enter, then go down to 
near the bottom of the "Programs" menu and select "MS-DOS PROMPT".  Hit enter.

	Now you are in a DOS window and in the C:\Windows directory.  Hit
[cd..] and then hit [fdisk /mbr], which restores the master boot record, 
preventing the password prompt from coming up when you reset the computer.

	Now just hit [<CTRL>-<ALT>-<DEL>] twice (once gets you to task manager,
twice reboots) and wait.  When you see

Starting Windows 95...
	
	on the screen, hit [<F8>] really fast just once, then choose "Verify
each step" (or something to that effect), usually choice number 4.  It will 
give you an A: prompt and say "Please give the path of your command interpreter, 
i.e. C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND.COM".  At this point, put the system disk you have 
made in the drive and hit [A:\COMMAND.COM].  Say "Yes" to everything except
the following:

	Log this bootup? (Bootlog.txt)? (y/n)
	C:\armguard.exe? (y/n)
		(***OR ANYTHING ELSE STARTING WITH "C:\ARM", LIKE "C:\ARMOR",
			for instance.)

	If you have done this right, ARMGUARD SHOULDN'T COME UP AT ALL.  If
it does, hit "command prompt only" instead of "Verify each step" and then
specify C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT and C:\CONFIG.SYS if it asks for the configuration
and the startup file.  (IN THE OPPOSITE ORDER.  CONFIG.SYS IS THE CONFIG FILE,
AUTOEXEC.BAT IS THE STARTUP FILE.)  Then immediately hit [<F4>] and it will
give you step-by-step confirmation for each item.  See above for the ones
to say no to.  Then you want to hit 

[C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND\EDIT.COM C:\WINDOWS\WIN.INI]

and the DOS edit program will come up.  Choose "Search" and hit "Find" and 
then tell it to find ARM and make sure it's NOT on match whole word only.
Delete any line with ARM in it that looks like a part of ArmorGuard.  This 
should prevent it from coming up on Windows.

*******IF NONE OF THIS WORKS, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE READ-ONLY AND ARCHIVE
ATTRIBUTES OFF OF THE WIN.INI, SYSTEM.INI, AUTOEXEC.BAT, AND CONFIG.SYS FILES
BY HITTING [ATTRIB -A -R (c:\WHATEVERFILE.YOUWANTTODOTHISTO)]

*******I'D ALSO RECOMMEND EDITING THE AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE TO PREVENT ARMGUARD
FROM EVER COMING UP AGAIN.

	****************THINGS TO DO AFTER HACKING ARMORGUARD***********

Hmmm....
USE YOUR IMAGINATION!

Think of this:  Hit "shut down in MS-DOS mode" or start up in MS-DOS mode,
put your boot disk in drive a: and hit the following commands

[A:]
[FORMAT C:]

and then confirm this.  You have just started the permanent erasing of 
EVERYTHING on the hard drive.  You can also do some other cool stuff with 
it too, just basically IF YOU WOULD DO IT TO SOMEONE YOU HATE, DO IT TO
WAL-MART.  Personally, I'd think that INSTEAD OF ERASING THE HARD DRIVE, I'D
WRITE A VIRUS AND PUT IT ON THE COMPUTER.  THAT WOULD REALLY BE MORE FUN. 
JUST STORE IT ON A FLOPPY AND COPY IT.
