LOGON PROCEDURE
---------------
 
  FIRST CALL A TELENET ACCESS PORT... ONE OF THE FOLLOWING WILL DO...
 
1-800-424-9494
1-313-996-5995
1-313-964-2988
1-313-235-8517
 
YOU WILL NEED TO BE SET UP FOR "NO ECHO". CALL UP THE TELENET ACCESS NUMBER AND YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS...
 
 
TELENET
 
313 19A
 
TERMINAL=
 
 
  WHEN YOU SEE THE "TERMINAL=" PROMPT YOU MAY TYPE "D1", "A2" OR JUST <CR>. THE SYSTEM WILL THEN RESPOND WITH...
 
 
@
 
  YOU WILL NEED TO TYPE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING "C 313 160" OR "C 312 160". THIS WILL PRINT DOUBLE CHARACTERS SINCE YOU ARE SET UP FOR NO ECHO... YOUR SCREEN WILL THEN LOOK LIKE THIS...
 
 
TELENET
 
313 19A
 
TERMINAL=AA22
 
@CC  331133  116600
 
 
 
313 160 CONNECTED
 
 
PASSWORD
XXXXXXXXXXX
IIIIIIIIIII
HHHHHHHHHHH
 
 
  IF YOU OPERATE WITHOUT LINEFEEDS THE LAST THREE LINES WILL PRINT OVER EACH OTHER... ON A PRINTER THIS FORMS AN ALMOST SOLID BLOCK.
 
 
PASSWORDS
---------
 
  EVEN THOUGH THE PASSWORD "MASK" IS 12 CHARACTERS LONG THE ACTUAL PASSSWORDS ARE ONLY 9 CHARACTERS LONG... THE FORMAT IS LIKE THIS...
 
N,LNNNNNN
 
WHERE N IS A NUMERICAL DIGIT AND L IS ALPHABETICAL... MOST PASSWORDS ARE CONFIGURED LIKE THIS...
 
9,XNNNNNN
 
THOUGH THE STORE MANAGERS WILL BE
 
8,XNNNNNN
 
THIS NARROWS THE PASSWORD DOWN TO SIX NUMARICAL DIGITS (1,000,000 POSSIBLITIES) THE REAL SECRET TO GETTING THE PASSWORD HACKED WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER.
 
 
 
AT THIS POINT WHETHER YOUR PASSWORD WAS GOOD OR NOT YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS...
 
 
PORT = $X25G00 #VC03    ON AT 00:00 CT,  00 FEB 1986
USERID:  ? 
 
 
 
USERID
------
 
  THE USER ID FORMAT IS EASILY FIGURED... MOST USER ID'S WILL BE
 
MS<4 DIGIT STORE NUMBER><2 DIGIT USER NUMBER>
 
THE USER NUMBERS TEND TO START AT 01 AND GO UP TOWARD 99 HOWEVER YOU WONT FIND 99... THERE WILL ONLY BE A FEW AT THE BEGINING... THE STORE MANAGERS USER ID WILL BEGIN "MM" INSTEAD OF "MS" AND SHOULD BE 
 
MM<4DIGIT STORE NUMBER>01
 
TO GET THE STORE NUMBER JUST CALL A MCDONALDS AND ASK THEM. ONE VALID STORE (IN DETROIT) IS 7025. THE MANAGERS ID IS THUS---
 
MM702501
 
ANOTHER LIKELY ID WOULD BE 
 
MS702501
 
AND SO ON...
 
 
 
TRASHING MCDONALDS
------------------
 
  MCDONALDS MANAGERS EACH NIGHT CALL UP THE SYSTEM AND REPORT ON SALES, PAY STOCK ETC. THE TERMINAL USED IS A TI SILENT 700 THERMAL PRINTER AND IT IS THE DOT MATRIX PATTERN OF THIS PARTICULAR PRINTER THAT FINALLY GAVE ME THE KEY TO HACK MCDONALDS. THE MANGER WHEN DONE WITH THE SYSTEM USUALLY JUST THROWS THE COMPUTER PRINTOUT WITH THE LOG IN IN THE TRASH... IF YOU GO THROUGH THE MCDONALDS DUMPSTER YOU CAN GET THESE SHEETS AND THEY WILL GIVE YOU THE KEY TO HACK THE SYSTEM. THE SHEET WILL HAVE THE 12 CHARACTR "BLOTT OUT" WHICH CAN BE DECIPHERED BECAUSE IT LEAVES 4 DOTS IN THE MATRIX EMPTY... WHEN THE USER TYPES THEIR PASSWORD OVER THE "BLOT OUT" THEY PVHTz9ORE MORE OF THESE 4 TINY DOTS WITH THE NEW CHARACTER. THE FOLLOWING IS A DOT MATRIX DECODER.
---------------------------------------

---------------------------------------
 
THIS DECODER WILL ALLOW YOU TO DECODE THE PASSWORD WITHIN JUST A FEW POSSIBLITIES MAKING THE PASSWORD EASY TO HACK OUT. THE SYSTEM WILL ALLOW YOU THREE ATTEMPTS PER CALL.
