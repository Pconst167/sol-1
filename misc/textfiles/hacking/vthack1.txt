
			   The VT Hacker
 			 by The Mad Hermit

	Welcome to the first installment of the hackers' corner.  In this
"electronic magazine", I will be speaking out on various issues relating to
computers, telephones, and other technological devices that have uses their
creators didn't intend them to have.  First, I would like to point out a
disclaimer.  The information given here will NOT compromise the security of any
institution.  It is NOT being distributed with the intent that it will be used
for illegal activities.  I (and everyone else here) hereby take NO
responsibility if some mentally deranged person gets bad ideas from this and
does something dispicable.  The information in this column will be just that:
freely available items of interest that have been collected from different
sources.  Any nasty ideas coming from knowledge of this information are the
fault of the person(s) who read(s) it.

	Now that I've gotten rid of that load, I'll tell you about the format
I'd like to try to follow.  Typically, I will have feature articles to start
things off.  After the feature, I intend to have news articles of interest to
all computer owners, followed by reader mail as space permits.  This time, I
have a crash course on the Tech (and other) library's VTLS system including
some of the more esoteric functions available.  These articles will more often
be written by me, but submissions are always welcome and WILL BE READ by me.
In future issues, I will talk about hacking on LocalNet, VMS/CMS, Unix/Ultrix,
BitNet, Pick, GTE's TeleNet, and a Hewlett Packard system on which your high
school might still keep grades and records.

	I would like to extend a call to all phreakers and hackers to send in
stuff about microcomputers, local BBS's, and bizarre phone #s also.  
	
	And Now..............VTLS - Virginia Tech's Library Search Service

	FIRST - the basic commands:
		A/ = Author Search
		B/ = Boolean Word search (Inaccessable)
		C/ = Call Letter Search
		/C = Return to last item screen (slash cmd)
		CA = Catalog listing screen (Local cmd)
		H/ = Holdings listing
		H = Holdings screen (Local cmd)
		HELP = Local help for current screen
		/HELP = General help screen
		L/ = Videodisk operation (Inaccessable)
		M/ = Call Letter Search
		MARC = Data file of the book or magazine (Local cmd)
		NS = Next Screen (local cmd)
		P/ = Professor Reserve listing
		PS = Previous Screen (local cmd)
		Q/ = Course ID reserve listing
		S = Special Book Status (local cmd)
		S/ = Subject Search
		SHOW = returns user to item list screen (Local cmd)
		T/ = Title Search
		/T = Show Date and Time (slash cmd)
		W/ = Word Search (Inaccessable)
		X/ = Videodisk operation (Inaccessable)

	The two slash commands, C and T, are interesting because they aren't
exactly in the normal input format.  The /C command is especially powerful
because although PS no longer returns you to the last screen after you type
/HELP, /C always will.  Note that four commands aren't implemented in this
version of VTLS.  Not being one to miss a chance for social engineering,
I asked various librarians some questions and managed to piece together a
rough outline of what is going on.  Word search (and its boolean couterpart)
and videodisk services were a part of VTLS when it was first conceived, and the
code that ran them was part of the original system.  If, however, these
commands were accessed by someone without the proper hook-ups, the terminal
crashed.  As a result, these features were removed.  Another problem
encountered was the fact that the terminals could send control sequences
(holding down the control key while hitting another key) that messed with the
system.  These have been rendered harmless.  Some control sequences are:


		CTRL-G = Beep
		CTRL-H = Backspace
		CTRL-I = Who knows (just beeps)?
		CTRL-J = Linefeed only
		CTRL-M = Return and Linefeed
		CTRL-P = Space
		CTRL-X = Prints "!!!" and then return
		CTRL-Y = Break key (this used to cause trouble)
		CTRL-1 = Displays special characters & turns off scrolling
		CTRL-2 = Turns off effects of CTRL-1
		CTRL-4 = Turns KeyBeep On/Off
		CTRL-6 = Slow Cursor Flash
		CTRL-7 = Fast Cursor Flash
		CTRL-8 = Fastest Cursor Flash
		CTRL-9 = Turns Cursor into an Underline
		CTRL-0 = Screen Blowup (alternates between "U" and "*")
		CTRL-Home = Clears Screen

		Novice vs. Advanced Searches on VTLS
	Normally the user operates in novice mode, but enterprising people
have discovered some advanced features including many more help screens than at
first imagined.  Simply type "?" and then <return> to get the Novice User's
menu.  Though only 7 choices are displayed, there is more than meets the eye.
Info about any of the advanced services can be obtained by typing in the
following command structure : "# ?".  The pound sign (#) represents the number
of the service you wish to get advanced help on.  What follows is a list of
currently known numbers and what they mean:

		1 = Author
		2 = Subject
		3 = Title
		4 = Call Number
		5 = ISSN Search
		6 = LSSN Search
		7 = ISBN Search
		8 = Word Search
		9 = Boolean Word Search
		10 = Professor Reserve
		11 = Course ID Reserve
		100 to 110 = Reserve Module Numbers (unused)

	The Reserve Module is another one of those things that has been
discontinued.  There also seems to have been an Acquisitions module, that the
main offices on the Sixth Floor might have used, but I don't know the numbers
for it.

	Announcing a 1-800 scan!  This phreaker pastime is being resurrected
around campus by several interested parties.  Pick an exchange (i.e. 1-800-XXX)
and dial as many numbers as you can, recording the ones that are answered or
return weird noises.  The numbers in each exchange go from 1-800-XXX-0000 to
1-800-XXX-9999.  This activity is PERFECTLY LEGAL, but the fone company has
been known to get suspicious of calling patterns where numbers in sequence are
dialed.  If this happens,  tell them that you aren't harrassing anyone or
frauding the fone company.  It's free, & informative.  To get you started, here
are some I have collected (if they don't work anymore, please tell me):
