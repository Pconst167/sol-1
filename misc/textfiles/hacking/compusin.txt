Hopefully I can help you about hacking CompuServe ID numbers and
Passwords...
Here are some helpful tips for all of you hackers out there:

     1) The two ID formats are
        a) xxxxx,xxx
        b) xxxxx,xxxx
     2) ALL ID numbers begin with '7'
     3) the second number is from '0-7'

     4) The password consists of two different words, in no way 
        related
        a) examples
           1) dog-school    2) ditch*scholar    3) penis/house
           4) phone?ashes
     5) keep in mind that the two words are always seperated
        by the ' * - ? / ' symbols
     6) I have noticed that:
        a) the first word of the password is 5 letters long
        b) the second word is 7 letters long

If you have any questions, findings, comments, or trades of 
any kind to make...
