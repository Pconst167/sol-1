MOD.book.FIVE: Who are they and where did they come from?
-------------

        Well, it's time again for another journal.  It's now the
        middle of summer 1991.  Lately we've heard a few good stories
        out of the mouths of people we don't even know.  There have
        even been a few funny occurances in the past few weeks.

        1) There are rumours that Phiber Optik was wasting his life
        away and not using his talents wisely.  Well, the truth of
        the matter is, he has been a speaker in many public debates
        and conferences on hacking in general and computer security.
        He is also working as a programmer/developer for a computer
        firm in NYC.  Also, he is working closely with the EFF (which
        recently have set up their own system for their organization).

        2) COMSEC is formed.  The *new* LOD (whose only member
        consists of Erik Bloodaxe) goes into the computer security
        business.  Nothing to date is documented on their services and
        we have yet to see what the hell they can provide.  EBA for
        one is an original member and he knows close to nothing
        (except for the things that he asked Phiber Optik to tell
        him).  Not to mention these guys are hardly corporate and have
        NO experience in the business end of computer security; which
        explains why they got caught misrepresenting themselves as
        Landmark Graphics to other well-established computer security
        firms.  Also, they have bragged about narking on a few members
        of MOD in their jealous rage.  This we can prove through
        insiders.

        MOD was never a textfile "how-to" group.  It was always based
        on a brotherhood type deal and everything done is secretive
        and has a purpose behind it.  LOD on the other hand, never
        made sense to any of us anymore.  It was good at first, when
        all the original (knowledgable) members were active, but
        lately it's become to be known as a group of guys with
        very sparce telecom knowledge riding on a name that once
        actually stood for something.

        Even Phiber Optik questioned whether LOD meant Legion of Doom
        or Lump of Doo-doo (on Gyrotechnic's private bbs).  He stood
        firm against all the other members on the system until finally
        they were dumbfounded and speechless.  Well, the board died.
        Now, PO and the rest of the MOD bunch take to them like a
        swatter to flies.  Give it up fellas.. it'll never work.

        3) Renegade Hacker (a NYC local) thinks he's cool.  He gets
        raided, starts talking, and when confronted by MOD, hides
        behind mommy.  Then he says he hates MOD (which is funny since
        he was sweating MOD's nuts since the day he first got a modem;
        those who were at the 2600 know what I mean..) The fact
        remains he is a real loser out to make a name for himself by
        trying to inspire those who have less contact with the better
        hackers in the community.

        NASTY (his group) = BIG Joke.
        (they write files..the National Enquirer of the h/p world)

        *Rent-A-Gay Hacker changed his phone #.. please note the new
        one in the database.*

        4) Lord Micro gets Xenix and creates what will be modnet 2.
        (The Wing is the administrator of #1 in PA)  Crazy Eddie
        plans to put up a bbs (open forum) in the 2600 Magazine
        format (like OSUNY, Central Office, The Toll Center).
        NO illegal shit...just theoretical discussion..what real
        hackers are made of.

        5) Vinny (The Technician) is "outed".  He is an admitted
        homosexual. I'm telling you.. watch out for these SSWC
        guys..they're a little funny, ya know?

        6) Mind Rape, or something like that, of NSA is a new pest.
        Gimme a break.  When will they ever learn?  Infiniti was
        another one, but I guess he's kept quiet..which is good.
        Let's just hope he doesn't ask Mind Dweeb for help.  Add
        Purple "no-show" Mustard (codez kid..see MOD/database for more
        info) to this catagory.  Also, there's another guy using
        Acid's handle in 216.  Wasn't home when we called twice.


Special thanks to Jack Hitt and Paul Tough of Harper's Magazine.
Great guys, good writers/editors..  damn that stuff was fun.

Hello to State Police Officer Donald Delaney.  Not such a bad guy,
just that he IS a cop and he DID bust some of us.  But he also got
those guys pirating cellular service in Queens, which really was a
major bust.  Nice tie.
