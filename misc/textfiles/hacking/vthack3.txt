
     Well, it's time for yet another installment in Virginia Tech
hacking.  Yes, it's....   VTHACK #3!!!!  Brought to you by the
Mad Hermit and crew.  This time, we're going to focus on the OTHER
big network on campus: LocalNet.  LocalNet (L-Net) has been around
for a much longer period of time, and as such has quite a few more
caves and back alleys to explore.  Its main purpose is to connect
the faculty and grad students directly to mainframes, and thus
much of what is found when poking around are login prompts.  An
aggrivating factor that has been added to this is the inclusion of
"Port Servers" (PS's).  You know when you've hit a PS when L-Net
tells you you've connected, but no key that you press has any
effect.  The purpose of a PS is to act as a deterrent to hackers.
It also might have the additional function of baud rate detection,
but though it sounds logical, we haven't found out for sure.  We
must admit that it does protect.  The best way to keep system
crashers away is not to tell them what they've found through simple
redialing.  This is a lot like keeping party crashers away by 
saying that there's a party going on at a certain place, but not
telling them who's invited or who's giving the bash.  Effective for
the dim-witted, impatient, and amateur party crashers, but not for
others. 
     PS's sit and stare out at you until you start sending it
characters.  If the first few aren't the specific ones it's looking
for, it will continue to gobble up everything else until you give
up and hang up.  Typical PS "codes" are easy-to-remember sequences
like 'ZZ' or 'ASDF', and they then pass you on to the main login
prompt.  These "codes" aren't like passwords, since the added
access they give you isn't worth beans unless you've got a line on
where to go from the login prompt.  However, we here feel that
information like that is in fact "restricted" in that you are
gaining unauthorized additional access to systems.  As such, we've
decided to leave the fun of figuring them out to those interested
in such weekend diversiions.
     Before we give you what you're probably waiting for: neato
numbers to call on L-Net, we'd like to explain stuff.  First, this
isn't a complete list, nor could it really be.  L-Net addresses are
in Hexidecimal and range from 0000 to FFFF.  That's 65536 different
possibilities.  We only went through ten thousand of these, and are
only listing those that got any response.  Second, L-Net addresses 
may connect to any number of ports, but we haven't seen any more
than 4 or 5.  Thus, the total possible connections assuming an
average of 2 ports per connection and an average of about 15
connections per thousand addresses comes to just under 2000.  
Assuming this is correct (very doubtful), finding where these are
is quite a task.  Third, and on the positive side, some connections
open up large worlds of access.  These unpassworded gateways are 
known as servers, and typically are DECservers.  The biggest and
most notorious is listed at 0358 and can handle a max of 128 users.
You can use these servers to connect to multiple computers at once,
and have extensive help files telling you what to do.  Fourth, and
also on the plus side, L-Net doesn't kick you off.  Ever.  Multiple
redialing is the name of the game, and listed below is a Red Ryder
script that works under version 9.4 that dials consecutive integers
at a rate of about 40 a minute.  Fifth and finally, bum connections
don't just leave you in the cold.  Hitting CONTROL-A twice pops you
immediately into local mode, where a STATUS tells you where you are
connected, and a "DONE X" will disconnect you from session number
X.  Calling, by the way, is done by typing "CALL XXXX[,P]" where
XXXX is the hex address, and P is the optional port number, which
is seperated by a comma.

Notes:
------
1) Node[20], popularly known as the Node Router, went out of
services shortly after VTHacker #2 was distributed.  Apologies
are NOT extended to those who assumed that the list in VTHack2
was gospel.  Things change all the time, and those things that
are especially good tend to go away.  Apparently, number 40062
was used by CNS's chief diagnostician as a way to test the VA
Council of Higher Education's access to the Net and L-Net.
Poking around there was terminated, but our scan of L-Net turned
up another way in...

2) If you wondered why the Node Router was labelled "20" (really,
what happened to the other 19?), then this might clear things up.
The following connections were observed:
     Node   What
     ----   ----
      0    Passworded
      1    L-Net
      3    the Net
      5    Passworded
      6    Passworded
      9    Dead End
     10    Dead End
     12    L-Net
     20    Restricted (*)

*) This did connect you to a really screwed up L-Net port, which
continually spewed out garbage and error messages, but we think
our poking around in it got it shut off, due to the incredible
quickness with which it was restricted (we were still on-line!)

3) Ah, what a joy it is to explore, and find a pristine cavern
laden with sweet delight, and a menu to boot!  Well, what I'm
talking about is BAMBI and THUMPR, two side-by-side DECServers.
Calling the listed numbers with port 0 gets you BAMBI, and using
port 1 gets you THUMPR.  In our experience, nobody has ever been
dumped for staying on too long, and though the computers you can
connect to aren't all that interesting (all Mechanical Engineering)
the services and privileges allowed to ordinary users is about
as generous as possible.  The listings that follow are vebatim
text sent by the servers, and we think that you'll be able to
figure out what's going on.

LOGGING INTO THE DECSERVER
To login to the DECserver you may be required by your server manager to enter a login password.  If you are not required to do so, go on to the next screen.  If you are, here are the steps to take to log in.
 
1  Press <RETURN> twice; a number sign (#) appears along with an audible "beep".
 
2  Enter the login password.  (You get the password from your server manager.)
   For example, to log in with the password A1B2C3...
 
       <RETURN> <RETURN>    enter <RETURN> twice
 
       # A1B2C3             type the password (which is not echoed)
 
3  If you make a mistake, the  prompt reappears (and the "beep")  to let you try again.  You have several chances to enter the correct password.
 
4  If you use a dial-in modem, you have 60 seconds to respond to  the  #  prompt with the correct password.  If you don't,  the server disconnects your modem.

If you do not need to enter a login password, press <RETURN> twice to  log  into
your DECserver.
 
When you log in, an introductory line of text appears...

USING ONLINE HELP
Online help is documentation about DECserver commands that is
stored  in  server memory.  You can see this documentation
interactively on your terminal while you are using the DECserver. The HELP command gives you access to online help.  You
can use it in two ways:
 
You can type HELP at the Local> prompt...
 
      Local> HELP
 
This generates a succession of HELP "frames", "menus", and prompts.
Frames are made  up of the information that can fit on one or more
terminal screens.  Menus are lists of topics you can choose from.
 
Alternatively, you can specify topics and subtopics  when  you
enter the HELP command.  For example...
 
      Local> HELP SET PORT
 
This command produces online documentation that describes the SET
PORT command.

 
SOME DEFINITIONS
The primary function of the DECserver is to allow you to connect  to  "services" offered  on  your  network.  A service can be a computer system that you can use just as though your terminal were attached directly to the system, or it can  be a function offered by such a system. In addition,  services  can  be  set-up  to
allow access to printers,  dial-out  modems,  personal  computers  and  terminal switches. To connect to a service, you only need to know the service name.

A "service node" is a computer system or server that offers services.

A "session" is a connection to a service.  You can have one or more simultaneous sessions  with  one  service,  or more than one service.  The connection you are using at any one time is called your "current  session". Your other sessions are inactive, but can be resumed by using server commands or session switches.
 
"Service mode" is your environment  when  you  interact  with  a  service.   For example,  if the service is a computer system, your environment is the same as a terminal directly wired to the system.  You can all use  the  system's  commands and resources.
 
"Local mode" is your environment when you  interact  with  the  DECserver  using commands entered at the Local> prompt.

 
CONNECTING TO A SERVICE
Use the local mode SHOW SERVICES command to display a list of services you  can use.
 
      Local> SHOW SERVICES
 
To connect to a service  (establish  a  session  with  the  service)  enter  the DECserver  CONNECT  command with the name of the service you want.  For example, for a service called SALES, enter the following command:
 
      Local> CONNECT SALES
 
This  command  places you  in  service  mode  in  an  active  session  with  the service SALES.


RETURNING TO LOCAL MODE FROM A SERVICE SESSION
To return to local mode without ending your session, press <BREAK> or press your local  switch  character.   Both  these  characters  are,  in  effect, DECserver commands that instruct the server to go back to local mode.
 
The <BREAK> character must be set up to permit this (by default it is), and  the local switch character must be defined (by default it is not).
 
Use the HELP command for more details on setting up the  <BREAK> character  and local switch character.
 
                                      NOTE
 
   Some modems interprets the <BREAK> character as a command to end
   your  dial-in connection.  If you are using one of these modems,
   do not use <BREAK> to return to local mode.

Your session, now inactive, is still your current  session  because
it is the session your were using most recently.


RESUMING YOUR SERVICE SESSION FROM LOCAL MODE
To resume your current session (and service mode) while your are in local  mode, enter the DECserver RESUME command.
 
      Local> RESUME

You go back to where you left off when before returning to local mode.


DISCONNECTING FROM A SERVICE
To end your current  session  while  in  service  mode,  use  the  command  that terminates  whatever  process  you  are using.  For example, you can terminate a session on a VAX/VMS system by typing the VMS  LOGOUT  command.   Refer  to  the documentation for the service node that offers the service.

To end your current session while in local mode, enter the DECserver  DISCONNECT command.
 
      Local> DISCONNECT

You  cannot  resume  a  service  session  after  you  end  the  connection  with DISCONNECT.


CONNECTING TO A SECOND SERVICE
The DECserver allows you to have several sessions at one time, to the same or to different services. To connect to a second (or subsequent) service, simply enter another CONNECT command from local mode, specifying the name of the service. For example, to connect to the service PRODUCTION, enter the following command:
 
      Local> CONNECT PRODUCTION

To resume one of your non-current sessions, use the FORWARDS command  to  switch to your next session,  or the BACKWARDS  command  to  switch  to  your  previous session.  Alternatively,  you can use the RESUME command and specify the session
number.  You can find this number from the SHOW SESSIONS display:
 
      Local> RESUME SESSION 2
 
To disconnect a particular session,  use the DISCONNECT command  and specify the session number. For example:

      Local> DISCONNECT SESSION 1
 
LOGGING OUT OF THE DECSERVER
To logout from the DECserver, enter  the  DECserver  LOGOUT  command  (in  local mode).

      Local> LOGOUT

LOGOUT disconnects all sessions.  A  DECserver  message  appears  verifying  the logout.


The next batch of stuff comes from DECServer 500:

And what about the other 55 thousand L-Net addresses we didn't try?
Hey, why don't YOU try them, and then share the news...?  We're 
already moving on to brighter futures in hacking, so stay tuned on
your local BBS or pass-the-disk network for: VTHacker #4 - Viruses,
reader response, Telenet, and more updates on previous info...
