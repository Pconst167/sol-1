             Newbie Tips: (Changing to / Hidden Directories) 1.1
             ===================================================
I've only done this with Unix, emacs, & ftp (not ncftp), but I know it's
probably doable in the same/different way on other systems like VMS, NeXT, 
etc. I assume you know what ascii, vt codes, etc are so just skim through
this, & maybe it'll help you out if you're caught on something. This isn't
a complete guide or anything.. it's just a few basic things that might be
useful if you don't already know them. There'll probably be a few people 
who won't like this getting around to every new person on the 'net (there's
enough competition out there for sitez as it is), but it's nothing anyone
shouldn't already now a bit about (If I gave out a new site list with
each file or something THEN I could see some ChAos happening! :-) 
Enjoy..

Changing to a directory with spaces, tabs, or anything really wierd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All you do is use quotes, ie. cd incoming/"..<sp>"/"^Z<tab>"/"<alt 30>"
To change to a dir with an      space--------^  tab---^ ascii seq--^
'Ascii sequence',   simply
hold  down  the  Alt key &
hit    the     appropriate 
numers.
*Note: this may be tricky if your term prog, or machine uses ALT keys
       for LOCAL actions.
____________________________________________________________________________
Figuring out what a hidden directory actually IS (you KNOW it's there, 
but don't know what to type to change to it)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I do is redirect it to a file, then look at the file with emacs! In
ftp type 'ls -al <filename>'.. this saves the directory listing to a file.
Then either shell, exit, or use another process & look at the file with
emacs. Emacs will actually show you the "^H^A" chars. You can even
distinguish the spaces from tabs.. if you move the cursor accross the 
directory name & it 'jumps' accross a bit.. it's a tab! I'm pretty sure
emacs can saftly display those nasty VT-wrecking control codes (^E^N ?).
____________________________________________________________________________
How to change to directories with tricky chars like '^Z','^C', etc..  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While at the prompt in the shell, type 'stty -a'. This gives you the
'mapping' of the few special control chars. All you do is remap 'suspend'
from ^Z to something else (say ^K): type 'stty susp ^K'. Now ^K is the
suspend char, NOT ^Z.. you can now type ^Z while in ftp without it 
getting thrown into the background! The same goes for ^C, ^R, etc..
 
 'stty susp ^K'
            ^^-- when you type this, use the char '^' and the char 'K'..
                 you don't really type the actual control code when you
                 'remap' them from the shell prompt. 
____________________________________________________________________________
Making directories, files with Color 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pretty much like changing to them. I.e. mkdir "^[[7mHello^[[0m" will make
a directory in 'reverse video' (it'll look like junk if your NOT using  
some kind of VT-100 term) but remember the actual dir is the escape
codes, not JUST 'hello'. Unix is interesting, because filenames can be 
pretty much any length, and have any kind of characters in them.. even 
Line Feeds!.
____________________________________________________________________________
Handling " characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quote char's can't be specified in quotes obviously. Like in Tcsh, the '\'
char can be used to prefix unusual chars instead of using quotes. The '\' 
method can be handy if the quote method doesn't work.. ie: 
to change to: <sp><tab>.^L              type: cd \<sp>\<tab>.\^L
to change to: "mydir<sp>^Hi             type: cd \"mydir\<sp>\^Hi
etc..
 
I know this is sort of brief but it should give you a general idea of what 
to look for and what to expect on when your poking around sitez. HaveFun!
