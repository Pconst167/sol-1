<H1>Hacking Textfiles: UNIX </H1>
<P>
The UNIX operating system has gone through many different and interesting
incarnations since it was invented in the early 70's, but one thing is clear:
It's a real fun system for a hacker to play with. Once you get past the
initial halting steps of learning what you can do with it, UNIX provides
many avenues of exploration, and many opportunities to get it to do things
that the owners of the machine didn't expect you (as a user) to be able
to do.
<P>
What's interesting about technical files like those below is that the
authors will often give you a basic set of skills with UNIX before
immediately delving into the arcana and weirdness necessary to do the
trickery they're attempting. It must have made for a mighty odd way
to learn about an operating system for a young person on a BBS. Maybe
it was even the better way.
