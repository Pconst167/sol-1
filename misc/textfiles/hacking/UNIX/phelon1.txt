   brings you another text phile and another bad ascii signature.
ok this file will be about.. hmm.. let's see. how about unix.  
ok.  well today we will talk about unices for the beginner, and then
just as a side topic, one of my faves of all time, the tacobell unix.
;)  anyways if you are a beginner at unix then you should rtfm but i guess 
since this is supposed to be the fm that you should read on. 
(riiiight??) on the other hand, if you're more experienced with unix,
check out the files "PHELON2.UNX" and "PHELON3.UNX" for more advanced 
unix hacking techniques.


ok .. let's start out with some defaults to help you out:

(root access - never seen any where the root pw was not changed.)
root
cron
adm
admin
sysadmin
sysadm
checkfsys
checkssys
umountfsys
makefsys
lpadmin


 - those are just a few with "root" access.. here are some more logins 
 that may or may not have root privileges.

bin
daemon
lp
uucp
sysdiag
tech
diag
... and on and on and on... but this isn't a defaults list so we won't go
on and on and on.  Find the phile "phelon.pws" written by yours truly
for the biggest default list around.


        but once you're in...

OK, say you managed to get your bumbling butt to a $ prompt or even 
better (and even more unlikely - heheh) a # prompt then here is what you do.

TO START OUT:

get the passwd file

turn on your term program's capture 
<start>
$ypcat passwd
<whole bunch of passwd shit should scroll down the screen>
once it's done turn off the capture and save the buffered file. or whatever.
if THAT didn't work, then type 
<start>
$sz passwd
<download starts>
this is even more unlikely to work... but it does work surprisingly often.
        ok now assuming you have the passwd file you go get a lame cracking
program like crack or crackerjack and run it over the passwd file with a 
zillion wordlists, and of course, data from the GECOS fields.  More advanced  
hacking comes later, for now get the accts and be happy until you reach
the next section in this file concerning this.

        BUT WAIT A MINUTE!  I never got in!

ok say that the system you are trying to crack is super tight and is
harder than a sonofabitch to get into.  my first advice would be to leave 
it alone.  however, if not then continue to the advanced section and try
out the techniques described there.


        OK here we go with more intermediate hacking..

ok say you want to find out all you can about a certain system.  the first
thing you should do is 'telnet <hostname> 79'.. this will telnet you to
port 79 of the target un*x.  Basically what this will do is show you who
is logged on and a bunch of info about them.  (oh, i should mention that
a *lot* of systems have this little feature blocked..;).. but if you know the
name of someone on the system you can still finger them remotely by using
"finger user@host".. pretty elementary shit.  OK another telnet port you
should know about and use actively is 25.  this will show you the version
of everyone's fave prog, sendmail! heheh.. look for a good file written
by i forget who bearing the title of sendmail.. this file has lots
of good exploits for the beginning to intermediate unix hacker. :)


**HEY!  I TRIED USING A PASSWD CRACKING PROG, BUT NOTHING WORKS!  THE 
GECOS FIELDS ARE JUST FILLED WITH AN "X" or "*" WHERE THE ENCRYPTED PASSWD IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE!!!

well calm down.. this is something called passwd shadowing, and to overcome
it you will need either a program like unshad.c, shadowpw.c, etc etc., that
will deshadow the passwd file so you can crack it or whatever.  or you
can write one for yourself...

oh yeah, i almost forgot.  here are some basic commands in unix..

        ls - lists directory.  often used arguments are -al (all) and 
        -alF (all + hidden.)
        sz - send zmodem
        rz - receive zmodem. up a trojan horse. ;)
        chmod - change file permissions. 
        chown - change file ownership
        finger - finger a user
        fortune - your fortune. heheheh
        telnet - telnet
        gopher - gopher
        lynx - lynx (unix's shitty version of a web browser.)
        irc - irc 
        setenv (BSD, SysV) change environment variables such as your
        IRCNAME, etc.
        declare -x (Linux) pretty much the same as setenv but for linux
        more < <filename> best way of reading a file (unless it's the passwd
        file in which case it doesn't show you the whole thing.)
        ftp - ftp
        lp - print
        cu - dialout
        makefile - compile a prog
        su - use it to try to hax root. <g>
        setuid - set your user id shell
        rm - delete a file
        cd - change directory
        rmdir - remove a dir
        mkdir - make a directory
        mv - move or rename a file
        vi - vi txt editor
        trn/tin/slrn - news readers
        elm - text editor
        emacs - text editor

oh and that other thing.. the tacobell unices.

TACO BELL is a funny place to hack.  i mean come on.. taco bell.  the 
security *always* sux!  so anyways...
1) find the store #.  this is accomplished by kalling your local taco hell
and saying:
"I am Joe Schmoe the taco bell hoe and i need to speak to your manager."
then when u are talking to the manager:
"yeah, i need to know your store #"
then they will say some shit or other and usually they will be cooperative.
ONCE you have the store #, what you do is dial THIS #:
*1.800.sos.taco*
now once you dial this # u will be presented with a series of automated
voice questions, etc, etc, bullshit yada yada so on and so forth.  just keep
pressing whatever sounds relevant (like 1, for computer stuph) until you get
a voice.  ONCE you have the voice:
sucker: "yes, can i help you?"
you: "yes, my name is bill clinton, and i'm the social engineer for the local
branch of taco bell.  we were having problems connecting to our computer, and
were wondering whether what # we were supposed to dial."
sucker: "ok, hangon a second.  what is your store #?"
<this is where you give the sucker the store # you obtained from dialing
up your local store.>
sucker: "ok, that's <NPA>, right?  the number is XXX-XXXX"
you: "ok, thanks a lot!"
sucker: "is that all the information you needed?!"
you: "yeah, turns out we were dialing the wrong number. oops. heh."
sucker: "heheh yeah that is kind of funny."
you: "sure is.  well thanks for the information, and tell your wife she 
gives great head.  bye."
<click>

(for the people out there who hang on #hack, some of that stuff you 
quite obviously wouldn't, and shouldn't, really say. <g>) 

NOW you dialup the number the sucker gave you...
once you are connected you will see the usual taco bell bullshit.
you can login with either:

        tacobell/ no password
        rgm/rollout

and then once you're in just phuxor around or have a truckload of beans
shipped to your enemy's house or whatever you feel like doing.  

for all the ppl in 612 here is the taco bell dialup for that ac:
888-5411
--------------------------

well anyway that's about it .. this was a lame text phile written in 
the middle of a class in skool (no joking i am supposed to be typing up
some shit about the civil war.  heheh) so catch me on irc (i'll probably
be banned from all the channels..heh) look for phelon and remember...

        "paranoia is a state of perfect awareness"

check for these other fine files written by the phelon 
PHELON2.UNX (intermediate unix hacking), PHELON3.UNX (advanced unix hacking),
PHELON.VMS, PHELON.CBI, PHELON.DEF (system75/definity), PHELON.PWS


        
        Error 23 - 612-869-2119 - sysop Bandon - looks like a normal
        gamer board, all the kewl stuff is hidden deep in the heart
        of the hard drive.. prove yourself for access to the secret areas!

        
  phuck all warez d00dz and k)dez kidz and fedz and the lamers on #hack.
        
 thanks and hellos to deadfall, unslider, and bandon - these guys are truly 
 elite and have helped me out a ton.
 also hello to mara and spyder.. <g>, and everyone else who i 
 would have remembered if i really gave a fuck about them one way or 
 another...hehehe j/k, and that's REALLY the end of this fine text, cuz 
 the bell is ringing.  adios...
