NFS TRICKS

Although NFS was originally was  wretten for UNIX systems,  rating from Macs,  PC's, and IBM main frames.  These versions allow for flexible file-sharing.  It's when the files with the text and graphicseside on a UNIX system.  Then the screen shots are saved by way of NFS, in files back on the UNIX host.

If you use a bunch of different computers,  NFS is often used to hook them all up together becaues it runs a much wider viriety of computers then does any other   file-sharing system.

NFS is based on a pair of standard inernet communication protocols called UDP/IP.  If your machine uses NFS,  therefore,  you can use NFS files that are easily found on the inernet.

If your computer and the one that the files live are connected by fast enough network,  you can use files many miles away just as if they were local.  Remote network links are considerably slower than local networks are, (most of the time 100 times slower) which means that you can get the impresion of a very slow disk.

For use as a regular file storage,  slow remote NFS is worthless to browse and retrieve files from an archive,  however NFS can be okay.  Systems which have large file archives allow anyone to access their disks by way of NFS.  Because public archive systems can have hundreds of directories and thousands of files,  mounting a remote systems disk by way of NFS lets you use familiar directory and file commands to look at them.  

It will take a while to list directories,  read files and so on,  but it would take a lot less time then if you used FTP (the standard remote-file program) if you find a file or group of files copy them to a disk if you plan on using them much.

Some UNIX systems, if it's configured correctly, mount remote NFS systems automatically,  however,  many do not.
