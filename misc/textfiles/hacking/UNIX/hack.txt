I'm very tired of people (so called 'hackers) asking me to teach them to
hack, or how to hack web sites...Well there is. There are, in fact, literally
hundreds of ways to do this. I'll discuss a few in this text to get you started.
Everyone must start somewhere and somehow, and hacking web servers and ftp servers
is yet one of the easiest ways. I really hope that you have _*SOME*_ basic knowledge,
of how web servers work and how to use some form of UNiX... 
I'll  explain that  stuff anyway for those of you who _*don't*_ know.  If you do, then
skip this lame part =c)



Part 1: The _*simple*_ UNiX commands 101

 If you have _*NO*_ clue whatsoever of what any of what that chart 'represents', here's yet more 
help for you...

On the right (in the above chart, CD, COPY DEL, DiR, HELP, and MOVE, are ALL MicroSoft, DOS commands.
What are MicroSoft DOS commands? Doh, commands you enter in a MicroSoft DOS Prompt!  Just try one, shell to DOS
(open a MicroSoft DOS prompt), if you don't know how just restart in DOS (Win95 users).   Win3.x users, just exit 
windows.  Once you are in DOS, type some of the above commands, in the chart, on the right =c).  On the left are
UNiX/LiNUX commands, that do they equivalent, of, the commands on the right...I hope this explains it enough...


        To find out who is in a system, simply type: WHO. To get information
about a specific user on the system type FINGER username (username = the name you 
fingering). By taking advantage of those basic UNiX commands, you can learn all you
need to know about the system you are currently 'in' (using).

Part 2: Cracking the passwords 101

        On UNiX systems the file that contains the passwords for all the users
on the system is located in the /etc dir (directory). The filename is passwd. 
So alltogether you need to access ~/etc/passwd.  All of the accounts in the
passwd file have _*ENCRYPTED*_ passwords. These passwords cannot be, in any way,
'decrypted'. However, there are programs that can be used to obtain passwords from
the file. I reccomed using 'Cracker Jack', or my favorite, John The Ripper...These 
prgramms use wordlists (a BiG LiST of words), then compares the encrypted forms
of the words in the list to the encrypted passwords in the passwd file and it
notifies you when it finds a match (NOT allways 100% of the time...).  John The Ripper,
or Cracker Jack, can be found at: www.hack3rs.com.

Part 3: Finding Password Files 101
Obviously, a systim adimin isn't just going to give out a passwd file to you.
You have to have a way to retrieve the /etc/passwd file without logging into the
system. There are two ways that this can sometimes be accomplished. Most of the time
the etc/passwd file isn't hidden from the public, in there ftp. To get the passwd 
file this way try using an FTP client to access the site _*ANONiMOUSLY*_ then check
the /etc directory to see if access to the passwd file is non accessable. If it is
not restricted then download the file and run John The Ripper, or Cracker Jack, or any 
other cracking programms on it. In some systems there is a file called PHF, located in 
the /cgi-bin directory. If there is then you are in luck. PHF allows users to gain
_*REMOTE-ACCESS*_ to files, even etc/passwd via the 'net. To try this method
goto your web browser and type in the following addy (URL (Address)):
http://the.site.url/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd
Make sure you change http://the.site.url to http://whatever the address of the page 
you're trying to hack... 


If all else fails, _*FiND*_ a way to get that file!  If you are stuck with a 'x' 
or '*' (in most cases you _*ARE*_), that means the file is shadowed.  There is 
_*NO*_ way to actually 'Unshadow', although, I've seen programms, that claim to 
do it...You may want to visit www.lorsomer.com, www.r0ot.org, or www.hack3rs.com... You have
to have some C programming knowledge, because you have to compile the programm using a compiler.
There are allways backups of passwd though!  Experiment a little, try etc/shadow
or something.

Part 4: Loggin on to _*YOUR*_ new personnal shell!

If you succeded in the password getting proccess, run your telnet client and
telent (Windows95's default telnet client can be ran by: clicking the start button,
then run, and then type telnet, hit enter.) to the server that you cracked the passwords for, such
as www.hack3rs.com (in Windows95's telnet client click conect, then remote server, or go to
MicroSoft DOS, and type: telnet address.goes.here).  When you connect, you will be prompted,
for both a username, then password. Just type in the information you got after cracking 
the passwd file.  Once in you can do whatever you want...I strongly do not recommend spreading
virii, or causing havoc...
          -Knowledge is _*POWER*_, and Information is _*STRENGTH*_-

Part 5: Newbies...

     Cracking is not hacking, so just remember that...If you are seriously into 
becoming a hacker,  check out your local library, or bookstoor, and pick up programming
books...HTML, C, JAVA, anything...Don't buy 'hacking books' they don't help much,
they just tell you about hacks, and social engineering...Check out www.hack3rs.com 
for newbie texts, and other rescources for the H/P Underground Comunity...
