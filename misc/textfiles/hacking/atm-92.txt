 NOTE: There has been a few files written about how to 'RIP OFF' ATM's of 
some sort but this file will not contain technical shit on the card tracks
or a xxxyyyooo17ss type of format. This text will tell you how to rip off
ATM's with out all of that technical stuff that you can't really use because
most of the stuff are too hard. So I give you methods on how you can defeat
ATM's with things you may or may not need to pay a-lot for! This file is
real unlike a file I came accross that a user uploaded on Blitzkreig called
KRAD#1 which I feel was written by 10year olds. That file is totally SHIT!
Now there was a-lot of Valid writers on the subject of ATM's but I feel
they were on the subject of PINs & PANs which is very hard to do right.

NOTE II: ATM theift is a Federal Crime and the Government doesn't like
         there funds fucked with. The author does not, DOES NOT bare 
         responsiblity for the misuse of the information, if you are
         able to commit any of the crimes listed then your able to be
         responsible for your own damn actions! Dont tell'em I made you 
         do it!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 I. CON JOBS

  New York City (My Home!) is the leader in ATM con jobs. Altogether, about
2,000 Citibank users were victimized by ATm con artist in one years time
for a tune of $495,000!!So I'm going to spread some light on what and how
these cons are pulled off.

Method 1: THE "DEFECTIVE ATM" CON


  A con method popular with Citibank ATMs netted one con artist $92,000-
with the unwitting assitance of his 374 victims. The scheme works in 
lobbies with more than one ATM, and a service phone. The well dressed and
articulate con man poses as a legit user and stands between two ATMs,
pretending to be talking to the bank service personnel over the service 
phone. After a user inserts his card into the ATMs card reader slot he
tells his that the machine is not working. The user withdraws his card
leaving the ATM activated. THe con man then observes theuser  enterring his
PIN into the adjecent ATM. Then, still holding the phone, the con man
enters the users PIN into the first ATM. In make-believe conversation with
the bank, the con man acts like he is receiving instructions from the bank.
To complete the theft he talks the user (major social engineering!) into
entering his card into the first ATM again to "test" or "clear" the ATM. He
claims that bank personnel think that the user's card "locked up" or
"jammed" the ATM and or that ATM may have made the users card defective,
and the insertion of it is required to "unlock" or "unjam" the ATM and/or
to verify that the user's card is still vaild. After the users leaves, the
con manenters into the keypad and withdraws the maximum daily amount from
the users account.
  This only works on Citibank ATMs cause they don't take the users card,
but once the card is slipped in the ATM is activated.

Method 2. PHONE PIN-EXTRACTION SCAMS
  Another popular con is for the con man to call up an ATM user whose card
he's found or stolen. He identifies himself as a police officer, and 
obtains the PIN from the user by stating that it is required by law to
verify the card owner. This works really well if you can bullshit them
good like act like you have to do something and tell them to call you
right back (on a loop!) and have a friend answer as the police
station! 
  
Method 3. THE BANK DICK CON
  A subject was recently was recently convicted in N.Y. and Boston of
defrauding ATM accounts of $150,000. He dubed over 300 ATM users into 
believing he was a bank security officer who needed assistance in the
apprehending of a dishonest bank employee. The users were convinced to
leave their bank cards under the locked door of the bank. The con man
would then "fish" the cards out. The next morning the con man would 
have someone make a phone call to the card holder saying that they have
caught the employee and dective "hacker" would like to thank you to.
But since the employee did come is contact with there card the bank is 
going to give them a new PIN # after the get the  old one! Then the con
man's helper would say come pick up your new card and we will tell you
your new PIN #.

II. Physical Methods

 Some folks just dont like to outsmart a system or person. They prefer the
more physical approach by either breaking or removing the ATM. The 
hazards are obvious-several built-in silent alarms,heavy stainless steel
safe like construction, the amount of commotion and noise that results
from their efforts, hard to dispose of evidence, etc. Those who have the 
most success with physical methods, plan and execute their operation as if
it were commando mission.
 The methods described below can also be used on night depositories,
payphones, dollar changers, candy machines, parking meters,etc. Physical
attacks must be completed within 10 minutes as ATMs abound with vibration,
heat and proximity detectors, and most are silent.
 To defeat any internal alarm mechanism,refer to the phone tapping approach
(described in detail later) that hooks-up both the ATM and main computer
to a programmed micro. So while Hood one is ripping-off or -up the ATM, the
micro is whispering sweet nothings to the main computer. NOTE that not all
ATM alarms transmit thru the ATM como lines, particulary with thru-the-wall
ATMs. To minimize the noise and commotion, heavy blankets(used by movers)
can be drapped over the ATM.

Method 1. SUPER COLD GASES
 Liquid nitrogen can be used. It is simply poured onto or into the offending
part of the ATM and when it hits 100 degrees or so, a sledge or a ballpeen
hammer is smartyl slammedin to. THe metal SHOULD shatter like glass. Then
one just simply reaches in and examines the untold riches stored inside.
Super-cooled gases can also wreck havoc on electronics, cameras and films,
and bullet-proof glass, and can be purchased from suppliers of medical and
chemical supplies.

Method 2. WATER & ICE
 We have also herd that pouring warm water into an isolated ATM on a very
cold night is effective. When water freezes, it expands with a terrific
force, and will shatter or tear apart anything made by man. The water is 
poured or pumped in thru the card slot or cash dispenser. It is heavily 
mixed with wood shavings or fiberglass to stop-up any drainage hole in the 
ATM. Leaks can also be plugged up with window putty or bubble gum.

Method 3. MORE FREEZE METHODS
 ATMs use ACE locks (the ones found on most vending machines, the circle
type lock) Freon works on these locks. Somw outlaws empty a can of freon
into an ATM lock, pound a screwdriver into the key way, and wrench the lock
out. And motor-driven ACE lock pick will vibrate pins into the right
positions withine a few minutes. The ACE lock picks can be aquired from
STEVE ARNOLDS GUN ROOM call (503)726-6360 for a free catalog they have
a-lot of cool stuff!

Method 4. ACETYLENE & DRILLS
 ATMs are notorisly vulnerable to attacks using acetylene torches. With most
ATMs no more than 5 minutes are required for the entire job! And most ATMs
can be drilled out in under 15 minutes, using carbide bits and high rpm
drills (check on my SAFECRACKING text to see more about drilling.).

Method 4. SHAPED CHARGES
 Placing shaped charges on each support and detonating them all at the same
time liberates the ATM. You can firgue this out by yourself.You can also
check most BBS's to find out how to make explosives but I wouldn't recommed
it, since most of the expolsive files I've seen are inaccurate and leaves
out MAJOR measurements and cautions! Your best best is to use black powder
that you can get form almost all gun stores.

Method 5. BLOCKING THE DISPENSER
 Some ATMs use money drawers. The ATM outlaw screws or epoxies the drawer
solidly shut, at the onset of a busy three-day holiday. At the end of each
night he returns and he removes the money by unscrewing or with a hammer &
chisel, shatter the epoxy bond.

III. ELECTRONIC & COMPUTER SCAMS
 Scarcely a week goes by that I don't hear about one scheme or another
successfully used by phreaks & hackers to penetrate large systems to access
data banks and to perform various manipulations. 
 Although we have only been able to verify one or two of the methods that
we will discribe, numerous cases have arisen in recent years in which an
ATM was defrauded with no evidence of a hardware or software bug to account
for the robbery.
 The outlaw can use several approaches. One is to use wiretapping. Another 
is to obtain the secrets of the cipher, or hardware or software defeats to 
the system and proceed accordingly. Another one that works with banks is to
set up phony debit accounts and program the computer to beleive that the
debit accounts are full of money. Then when a three day weekend comes around
proceed with friend to deplete all of these debit accounts by making various
rounds to ATMs.
 Electronic frauds of ATMs require an excellent technical understanding of
phone and-or computers all of which you can obtain from worthy underground
news letters such as TAP, and 2600, etc. OR from a H/P BBS.
 "Tapping" or "wiretapping" consists of the unauthorized electronic
monitering of a signal (voice or digital) transmitted over a phone or
computer (commo) circuit. A "tap" is the monitoring device that does this.
Athough a tap is usually placed somewhere on a phoneline or junction box,
it may be placed inside of a phone, modem or computer.
 With the advent of isolated stand-alone ATMs (with vulnerable phone lines,
including POS terminals) and computer technology. The phone circuits that 
connect ATMs to their host computer (located in the banks data processing
center) can be tapped anywhere between the two.
 An "invasive tap" is one in which a hard electronic connection is made
between the tap and the commo circuit. A "non-invasive" tap is one in which
an induction loop or antenna is used to pick up the EMI generated by the
signal, and there is no physical connection between the commo circuit and
the line.
 A "passive tap" is one in which the tap simply tramits to a recorder or 
directly records the tapped signal and in no way interfers with it. An
"active tap" is one in which the tap ALSO interferes (changes,adds to or
deletes) the tapped signal in some way. Active taps are more sophisted. A
typical ATM active tap is one that records a signal, the later plays it
back over the line.
 Be sure to look for my text "HIGH TECH TOYS" it lists were to get things
that are VERY hard to get or things that you may need a license to obtain
without those hassles all you need will be money!

Method 1. PASSIVE TAPS
 All tapped ATM transactions are recorded over a period of time (but not
interfered with). Once the serial protocal and MA codes are understood,
the transmitted data is decrypted (if encrypted) using known entry data
to the ATM. Note that some systems use a MA code that is complex and 
very difficult to crack.
 Messages to and from the ATMs host computers are composed of various
fields. One field identifies the transaction type, one the PIN, one the
PAN, one  the amount, one the approval code, one the transaction number
and perhaps other fields. In most systems, either nothing is encrypted 
or only the PIN field. In others, the entire message is encrypted.
 The ATM/host circuit is monitored over a period of time to deterive
PINs,PANs and other entry data of other ATM users based upon (decrypted)
transmitted data. Phony debit cards are then made to defraud ATM 
accounts with known PINs and PANs.

Method 2. ACTIVE TAPS
 Active tapping is one method of spoofing. The c4ritical part of the host
computer's message are the approval and amounts fields. The critical parts
of the ATMs transmission are the continuous transmission it makes to the 
host computer when NO one is using it to indicate that it is OK, and the
PIN and amount fields. Booth good and bad cards and good and bad PINs are
entered at various times and days to differentiate between the various 
massage components. Various quiescent periods is also recorded.
 Once the message structures are understood, a computer is then substituted
to act as both the host computer and the ATM. That is, a computer is then
connected between the ATM and the host computer. This computer acts like
the host computer to the ATM, and like the ATM to the host computer.
 An accomplice uses the ATM to go thru the motions of making legitimate
transactions. If his procedures are correct, the ATM communicates, with 
the host computer for permission to discharge the money. Several methods:
 
(A) The phreaker changes the approval field in the hosts message to OK
the transaction regardless of its real decision. The phreaker may interdict
the message regardless of iits real decision. The phreaker may interdict
the message from the ATM to tell the host that the ATM is inactive while it
interdicts the host message to tell the ATM to disburse the cash. Since the
ATM is no longer connected to the host computer, and the host computer 
believes that it is talking to an unused ATM (or one engaged in balance 
inquiry transaction), no monies will be deducted from any debit account, no 
denials will be made based upon daily maximum limits, and no alarm will be
sounded due to suspicious behavior. Even if the ATM sounds an alarm, the
host computer wont hear it as long as the phreaker is whispering sweet
nothings into its ear. Also by using this method, as long as the PIN & PAN
check digits are legitimate ones based upon the ATMs preliminary and cursory
checks, the PINs and PANs themselves can be phony because the host won't
be there to verify legitimacies! That is no legal PINs and PANs need be known
nor the algorithm for encrypting PINs.
 
 (B) The ATMs message is replaced by a previously recorded legitimate 
transaction message played back by the phreaker. The cash is despense as
before. The play back method won't work if the encryption or MA process
embed a transaction, clock or random code into the message, making all
messages unique.

 (C) The phreaker/hacker changes the PIN field in the ATMs message to a
legitimate PIN of a fat-cat like DONALD TRUMPs account. The phreaker/hacker
then withdraws someone else's money.

 (D) The phreaker/hacker changes the amount field in the ATMs message to a
much lower one, and then changes the amount field in the host's message
back to the higher amount (debit transactions- the opposite changes are made
for credit transactions). Sooo the phreaker can withdraw $200 from his
account with only $10 actually debited from it by the host. He can then make
many withdrawals before the host cuts him off for exceeding the daily max.

Method 3. TEMPEST IV
 A thin induction pick-up coil, consisting of many turns of one thickness
of #28 or thinner enamel wire sandwiched between two self-adhesive labels,
no larger than a debit card, can be inserted at least part way inside the
card slot of most ATMs. This coil is then used to "listen in" on the
electrical activity inside of the ATM to try to determine which signals
control the release of money. Using this same coil as a  transmitter
anteenna, these signals are then transmitted ti the realse logic to activate
it.
 It is believed that a thin coil about the size of a dime can be maneuvered
quite a ways inside most ATMs for sensing purpose, and that small metal 
hooks have also been fed into ATMs to obtain direct hookups to logic and
power circuits.
 It is believe that some outlaws have obtained ATM cards. They then machined
out the inside of the cards, except the magnetic strip. They then place flat
coils inside the machined out area. They then monitor the coils during 
legitimate transactions. They can also use the coils to transmit desired
signals. This is kind of the method used in TERMINATOR 2.

IV. BOGUS CARD, GETTING PINs

 Almost all credit cards now come with either a hologram or an embedded chip
("Smart Card"), and are thus nearly impossible to counterfeit to date.
However, since most debit cards are not optically read by ATMs, they are
much easier to counterfeit. To counterfeit a card the following is needed:
     (1) A card embosser, which can be readily obtained from commercial 
sources (see "Embossing Equipment and Supplies" or similar in the Yellow
Pages) without question asked. A used, serviceable embosser ran use $210 +
shipping & handling. (2) A magnetic stripe decoder/encoder (skimmer), which
can be purchased from the same company as the embossing equipment or just
look in the back of Computer Magazines. (3) PIN checkers are not known to be
available to the general public. However, if one were stolen, the user could
guess at card PINs by trial-and-error effort based upon the knowledge of how
PINs are derived. (4) PANs,PINs and ciphers, which can be obtained from a 
number of ways usually involving theft. About 50% of ATM users write their
PINs either on their debit card or somewhere in there wallet or purse. And
most user-chosen PINs are easily guessed. The encrypted PINs can be directly
lifted or read from the magnetic stripe, and the encryption scheme determined
by comparing the encryption with the known PIN # of a dozen or so cards.

that there is more on the subject that I have left out either because I dont
want to put it or because my staff: The High-Tech Hoods did get or know the
