                  BITNET USAGE GUIDELINES
 
 
The BITNET Usage Guidelines have  been  established  by  the
BITNET Board of Trustees to remind  users  of  the  intended
purpose of BITNET, Inc., and to offer some solutions to avoid
abuse.  While BITNET  has proven an extremely useful network
for scholarly research and  communication,  it  is  not  and
should not be considered a secure network, and should not be
relied on for transmission of confidential or sensitive data.
 
 
o   All  use  of  BITNET must be consistent with its goal to
    facilitate the exchange of non-commercial information in
    support of the educational  and  research  interests  of
    Class  A  and  B members.
 
o   All transmissions from Class D and E members to Class D
    and E members are prohibited  except to the extent they
    relate to conference  or  committee  activity sponsored
    by a Class A, B, or C member.
 
o   Large files sent over BITNET may cause traffic problems.
    A  large file will reach its destination, but will do so
    at the expense of  many  other  users.  Therefore,  file
    transmissions   are  limited  to  300,000  bytes  (3,750
    eighty-character records) regardless of the time of day.
    Files exceeding this limit may be divided into a  number
    of smaller files of 300,000 bytes or less, and transmit-
    ted at appropriate intervals.
 
o   Since  interactive  messages  take  precedence  over all
    other transmissions,  extensive  use  of  messaging  can
    block  the  flow  of BITNET traffic. Therefore, applica-
    tions which make extensive use of interactive  messaging
    capability,  such  as BITNET-based PVM software, are re-
    stricted to research use for designated computer  center
    staff.
 
o   Proprietary software may not be sent over BITNET.
 
o   Random  mailings  (junk mail), casual contacts ("Who are
    you?"  messages), and job solicitations are discouraged.
 
 
Guidelines may change as the need arises. All members of the
BITNET  community  are responsible  for  seeing  that  these
constraints  and  courtesies  are upheld.  Abuses  should  be
reported  to  local user services.
