Policy for Responsible Computing Use at the University of Delaware

In support of its mission of teaching, research, and public service,
the University of Delaware provides access to computing and information
resources for students, faculty, and staff, within institutional
priorities and financial capabilities.

All members of the University community who use the University's
computing and information resources must act responsibly.  Every user
is responsible for the integrity of these resources.  All users of
University-owned or University-leased computing systems must respect
the rights of other computing users, respect the integrity of the
physical facilities and controls, and respect all pertinent license and
contractual agreements.  It is the policy of the University of Delaware
that all members of its community act in accordance with these
responsibilities, relevant laws and contractual obligations, and the
highest standard of ethics.

Access to the University's computing facilities is a privilege granted
to University students, faculty, and staff.  Access to University
information resources may be granted by the owners of that information
based on the owner's judgement of the following factors: relevant laws
and contractual obligations, the requestor's need to know, the
information's sensitivity, and the risk of damage to or loss by the
University.

The University reserves the right to limit, restrict, or extend
computing privileges and access to its information resources.  Data
owners--whether departments, units, faculty, students, or staff--may
allow individuals other than University faculty, staff, and students
access to information for which they are responsible, so long as such
access does not violate any license or contractual agreement;
University policy; or any federal, state, county, or local law or
ordinance.

Computing facilities and accounts are owned by the University and are
to be used for the University-related activities for which they are
assigned.  University computing resources are not to be used for
commercial purposes or non-University-related activities without
written authorization from the University.   In these cases, the
University will require payment of appropriate fees.  This policy
applies equally to all University-owned or University-leased
computers.

Users and system administrators must all guard against abuses that
disrupt or threaten the viability of all systems, including those at
the University and those on networks to which the University's systems
are connected.  Access to information resources without proper
authorization from the data owner, unauthorized use of University
computing facilities, and intentional corruption or misuse of
information resources are direct violations of the University's
standards for conduct as outlined in the University of Delaware Policy
Manual, the Personnel Policies and Procedures for Professional and
Salaried Staff, the Faculty Handbook, and the Official Student Handbook
and may also be considered civil or criminal offenses.

The University of Delaware treats access and use violations of
computing facilities, equipment, software, information resources,
networks, or privileges seriously.  Disciplinary action resulting from
such abuse may include the loss of computing privileges and other
sanctions including non-reappointment, discharge, dismissal, and legal
action--including prosecution under Title 11, $931-$939 of the Delaware
Code, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, or other appropriate
laws.
