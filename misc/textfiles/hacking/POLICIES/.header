<H1>Computer Usage Policies at Universities and Institutions</H1>
<P>
These policy statements came to textfiles.com off a hacking CD purchased
online; whoever had the idea to save this, thank you. They give great 
insight into how different universities dealt with hundreds of incoming 
students, each more computer-savvy than the previous class, who were
twisting and bending the computer networks to their whim. You can almost
tell on a school-by-school basis what horrifying event had happened,
from the administrators' point of view, and what they were trying to
account for.
