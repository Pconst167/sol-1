Following is a policy statement a policy statment appearing in the Univerity's
Student Handbook, as well as a copy of our standard agreement form which is
used by students, faculty and staff yearly (yes, faculty, too!) in order to
have a VAX account and/or use the Computer Center facilities, including all
satellite locations.  It is deliberately written to appear as the legal
document it is, in order to impress on the signers that what they are signing
is to be taken seriously, and that it is important to us.  We often tell them
to be sure to read the agreement, and we often ask them also if they
understand it, and its significance.  We feel this is particularly important
because of the statement on ownership of the machines and their files, and
the University's right to protect itself, when necessary, by inspection of
files.  The policy and agreement form were also approved by University
counsel before being implemented.
 
I have used this statement and agreement, in this or similar forms, for about
eight years at Colgate, and several years at Tulane before that, and although
I have received several threats of lawsuits from students and faculty, et al,
after consultation with attorneys the individuals involved chose not to
further challenge the policy.

                              COLGATE UNIVERSITY
                           ACADEMIC COMPUTER CENTER
 
 
                   AGREEMENT FOR USE OF COMPUTING FACILITIES
 
 
                                                 Date: _____________________
 
 
    I hereby acknowledge that permission is granted to me by Colgate
University for academic, non-commercial use of the computing and communica-
tions facilities and services of the University's Academic Computer Center,
including its VAX computer system, associated peripherals and files, telephone
and network access, and its microcomputers, according to the terms described
here.
 
    I further acknowledge that permission is granted for use, at the Colgate
Computer Center and its satellite areas, of diskettes containing licensed
software according to the regulations set forth here by Colgate for the use of
such diskettes.  I understand that use of such software is governed by the
terms of licensing agreements between the University and the software
licensors, and I agree to abide by the terms of those agreements.  I expressly
acknowledge that these software programs are proprietary and may therefore be
subject to  copyright or patent restrictions as defined in the license
agreements.  I agree not to copy, disclose, transfer, or remove from the
designated user area, any of the microcomputer software issued to me by the
Computer Center, including programs, applications, databases, and code.  I
agree not to use Colgate University equipment or software to violate the terms
of any software license agreement, the limits of use described in the 1989-91
Colgate Student Handbook standards of conduct (pg. 92), or applicable Federal
or New York state laws and regulations pertaining to copyright violations.
 
    I accept full responsibility for the return to the Center, at the
termination of each microcomputer work session, any licensed software disk-
ettes issued to me by the Computer Center.  For failing to return diskettes,
I will be subject to a fine of $10 per day for a maximum of seven days, at
which time I will be subject to a charge equal to the replacement cost of the
missing software, but not less than $70.  Further, I understand that illegal
copies of proprietary software in use on Colgate equipment will be subject to
the immediate confiscation of such copies and the referral of such incidents
to the Judiciary Board.
 
    I also agree not to use Colgate's computer systems, including any of its
communication facilities and services, in any way which deliberately
diminishes or interferes with the use of those systems by others, or which is
intended to do same.  I acknowledge the right of the management of the
Academic Computer Center to remove immediately any files intended for any such
misuse.  I further acknowledge the right of Colgate University, and its
designated staff, to inspect, when necessary as a function of responsible
system management, all disk files stored on the Center's computing facilities.
 
    I understand that upon violation of the terms of this agreement, the
Computer Center retains the right to deny future computing privileges at all
Computer Center facilities.  I understand that I may also be subject to
further disciplinary action by the Judiciary Board, as well as legal action
by the owners and licensors of proprietary software for violation of copyright
laws and license agreements.

User Accounts:  Students wishing to use the VAX or University-licensed
microcomputer software must fill out an account application form at the
Computer Center.  The form contains a statement on the limits on computer use
which must be read and signed by the prospective user.  Applicants will be
required to display a current Colgate identification card.
 
Limits on Use:  There are no time limits or charges (except for the use of
laser printers) for student use of the Colgate computing facilities.  There
are, however, limits on the amount of disk space available for student
directories on the VAX.  VAX users are encouraged to maintain only active,
frequently used files on disk.  A tape utility program is available for the
user to store all other files on personally-owned reels of magnetic tape.  The
same utility program permits the user quickly and easily to restore needed
tape files back to user disk space.  The University Bookstore maintains
supplies of magnetic tape, as well as other computing supplies such as disk-
ettes, printer ribbons, and continuous-form paper.
 
      While extensive efforts are being made to keep the computer facilities
at Colgate open and accessible, there must be reasonable limits on the types
of activity which can be permitted if numerous users are to coexist as
computing equals.  Improper activities, for example, would include the
intentional damaging of computing equipment, facilities, or software; the
unauthorized use, deletion or alteration of VAX accounts or files belonging to
other users; using the VAX, or access to any internal or external network
service, to harass or intimidate individuals or interfering with their
reasonable and normal use of the system; creating personal copies of licensed,
proprietary software; or deliberately altering system files or operating
system software in any way that would prevent or interfere with the intended
use of the computer system by others.  The Computer Center will suspend all
computing privileges of any individual who persists in engaging in any of
these improper computing activities; serious cases will be referred to the
Judiciary Board, and, where violations of state or federal law are involved,
to the proper civil authorities.
 
      Ownership of the contents of all disk file storage on the VAX-11/780 is
retained by Colgate University, which asserts the right to access and inspect
all user files when necessary for the management of the system.
 
      Users of microcomputers may not make personal copies of proprietary
microcomputer software supplied by the Computer Center.  Program diskettes may
be checked out for use only in the Center or satellite locations and may not
be removed from those areas.  A fine of $10 per day up to the replacement cost
of the program or $70, whichever is larger, will be charged against anyone
removing diskettes from the Center or satellite area.  Unlicensed copies of
proprietary software are subject to immediate confiscation and complaints
against the user of the illegal copies will be brought before the Judiciary
Board.
