 PREFACE:
  
   TELENET IS A HUGE NETWORK WHICH LETS
More [Y,n,=]? 
                
 YOU ENTER ANOTHER COMPUTER VIA 
 TELENET'S AND COSTS A LITTLE EXTRA TO
 THOSE WHO LOG-ON TO THEIR OWN
 CONNECTION AND ACCOUNT (BUT OF COURSE
 WE SHALL IGNORE THAT). 


 ===========  
 - HACKING - 
 ===========

   FIRST DIAL YOUR LOCAL TELENET DIAL 
 UP - HERE ARE JUST A FEW:
    
        BUFFALO      (716) 847-0600
        CHICAGO      (312) 938-0500
        DETROIT      (313) 964-5538
                           964-2989
        MANHATTAN    (212) 736-0099
                           947-9600
                           785-2540
        ROCHESTER    (716) 454-3430
                           454-1020
More [Y,n,=]? 
                
        WASH. DC     (202) 347-1400
                     (703) 435-3333
        WHITE PLAINS (914) 328-9199

   IF YOUR AREA IS NOT LISTED CONTACT
 YOUR LOCAL PHRACKER (PHREAKER /
 HACKER) AND ASK HIM IF HE HAS A LOCAL
 DIAL-UP FOR YOUR AREA.

   ONCE YOU LOG ON <RETURN> AND IT WILL
 ASK YOU FOR A TERMINAL IDENTIFER. YOU
 CAN TYPE D1 IF YOU ARE USING A
 PERSONAL COMPUTER OR JUST HIT RETURN.
   THEIR ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPUTER
 SYSTEMS CONNECTED TO TELENET, ALL YOU
 NEED TO DO IS TYPE THEIR CONNECTION
 NUMBER. 
   THE FORMAT IS: C NPAXX OR C NPAXXX
 WHERE: 
  C IS AN ABREVATION FOR 'CONNECTION'.
  NPA IS THE AREA CODE OF THE COMPUTER
      SYSTEM YOU WISH TO FIND.
  XX OR XXX IS ANY 2, AND SOMETIMES 3
More [Y,n,=]? 
                
            DIGITS.
  
   SO TO SEARCH FOR A COMPUTER IN 202
 YOU WOULD HACK FROM 20201 UP TO 20299
 AND 202001 TO 202999.


 =============
 - RESPONSES -
 =============

   ONCE YOU DIAL THE CONNECTION NUMBER
 OF WHAT YOU HOPE IS A COMPUTER SYSTEM
 YOU WILL MOST LIKELY GET ONE OF THE
 FOLLOWING RESPONSES (WE WILL USE 
 21211 AS AN EXAMPLE):

  "?" 
      - YOU HAVE TYPED IN SOMETHING 
        WRONG (SEE FORMAT).
  
  "212 11 ILLEGAL ADDRESS"
      - THERE IS NO COMPUTER SYSTEM AT
More [Y,n,=]? 
                
        212 11 (TRY ANOTHER).
  
  "212 11 CONNECTED"
      - YOU ARE NOW CONNECTED TO THE
        SYSTEM AT 212 11 AND SHOULD
        PROCEED.

  "212 11 NOT RESPONDING"
      - THERE IS A COMPUTER SYSTEM AT
        212 11 BUT IT IS NOT WORKING
        NOW (TRY LATER).

  "212 11 NOT REACHABLE FROM..."
      - THERE IS A COMPUTER SYSTEM AT
        212 11 BUT IT CAN NOT BE
        REACHED BY THIS TELENET DIAL-UP
        (TRY A DIFFRENT DIAL-UP).

  "212 11 DOES NOT ACCEPT COLLECT 
   CALLS" 
                  AND 
  "212 11 DOES NOT ACCEPT COLLECT
   CALLS. PLEASE ESTABLISH A PAID
More [Y,n,=]? 
                
   CALLER ACCOUNT"
      -IN MOST CASES THE COMPUTER
       SYSTEM WILL ACCEPT COLLECT CALLS
       FROM WHOMEVER CALLS THEM, BUT A
       FEW REQUIRE YOU TO ESTABLISH A
       SPECIFIC LOG ON WITH TELENET
       FIRST TO PLACE A PAID CALL TO
       A GIVEN CONNECTION.


 ============
 - COMMANDS -
 ============

   HERE IS A SHORT SUMMARY OF TELENET
 COMMANDS.

 COMMAND        EFFECT
 -------        ------
 FULL         - SETS NET TO FULL DUPLEX
                (NO ECHO).

                (ECHO).
More [Y,n,=]?

                STILL ATTACHED.

                STILL ATTACHED.

 ============
 - COMMENTS - 
 ============

   TELENET IS A RATHER SAFE NETWORK TO 
 HACK OFF OF BECAUSE THE LOCATIONS 
 USUALLY CAN NOT TRACE YOU AND IF THEY
 DO, CAN PROBALLY NOT TRACE YOU THRU
 TELENET. ALSO IF A COMPUTER SYSTEM IS
 FAR AWAY AND YOU WISH TO LOG ON TO IT
 THERE IS NO EXTRA COST OTHER THAN THE
 COST TO CALL TELENET.
