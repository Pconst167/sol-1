Accessing Telecom Australia`s AUSTPAC service.

AUSTPAC is a great way to connect to major companies. This is how it works:
You call AUSTPAC for 20cents, then you can make up to 5 connect tries 
before it cuts you off. When you dial a number in the format ?xxxxxxxxx
you will be connected at the service providers cost, ie. if it is a company
in the US, the company will pay the bill!! This is great as most companies
allow you to attempt to log on 3 times, but with AUSTPAC you can go through
15 password attempts per call. Some of the systems even have limitless
attempts, they pay for the american call and you sit there all night going
through password libraries!!!

Phone Numbers:
 01921 - v21, 300baud
 01922 - v22, 1200baud
 01923 - v23, 1200/75baud
 01924 - v22bis, 2400baud
(not sure about 9600, 19200 baud but who can afford them!!??)

The only problem with the service is that it acts as a centre point and while
you connect to it at 2400baud it actually connects to the service at 9600
or 19200 baud depending on the service. This unfortunately can cut you off
if you are receiving text so it is best to press [SPACE] or something similar
every few minutes so you don`t get an inactivity log off. When receiving
files this is a pain and you USUALLY get cut off so make sure if downloading
you are Batch-Downloading.

There are thousands and thousands of services on AUSTPAC. Pick up a list from
your local HackBBS or write your own simple comms program to go through a
big list, 5 per call, 4c a try, so this works out to around $4.00 to check
almost 100 NUA`s. 

An NUA is the name of the number to a service provider specified with 
?xxxxxxxxx. It is sometimes the case where you also need to provide an NUI
after the initial NUA in the same format ?xxxxxxxxx to connect.

A complete list of error codes is listed below:
