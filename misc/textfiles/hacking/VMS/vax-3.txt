        VAX VMS COMMANDS:
        ================

           Once  you  get your "$" prompt, you will be able  to  type  in
        hundreds of commands of course.  I will go over a few basic  ones
        here:

        @                -  Execute procedure.  When you want to run  any
                            DCL  batch or *.COM;* file, you must  include
                            this "@" before the filename.
                            EX: @LOGIN.COM;3

        ACCOUNTING       -  This will run the accounting program.  If you
                            log  out of a system and you see charges  put
                            on  your account for the amount of  time  you
                            are on, the system is using account.  Actual-
                            ly every system uses accounting somewhat, but
                            it  can be made virtually invisible.  If  you
                            are  desperate,  or you are  having  troubles
                            with the system operators of the VAX  (SYSOPS
                            from  now  on), you can use this  program  to
                            your advantage.

        CREATE           -  This will create just about anything.  If you
                            have a  program that you have written on your
                            PC's Pascal interpreter, you can Ascii upload
                            the file to the VAX using the CREATE command.
                            EX: CREATE program.pas;1

        CREATE/DIR       -  This will simply create a SUB directory for
                            you.  I will explain how to get around a  VAX
                            in a minute.  See the SET command.
                            EX: CREATE/DIR NameOfDir

        DELETE           -  Just used to delete a file or  EMPTY,  UNPRO-
                            TECTED  DIRECTORY.   To delete a  file,  just
                            type  "DEL filename.ext;x."  To delete a  sub
                            directory,  first delete all of the files  in
                            the  directory:  "DEL/LOG *.*;*"   Next,  you
                            will    need   to   SET   PROTECTION:    "SET
                            PROTECTION=OWNER:D dirname.DIR"  Next, delete
                            the directory: "DEL dirname.DIR"
                            EX: DEL DAVID.TXT;4

        DIRECTORY        -  This will show you  what files are  contained
                            in  the current directory.   Adding  "/BRIEF"
                            will  give  you a short  listing  and  adding
                            "/FULL" will give you a full listing  includ-
                            ing  security information on each file.   You
                            can  shorten the command to DIR and  you  may
                            use wildcards.  The "*" means anything of any
                            length.  The "%" means anything one character
                            length.
                            EX: DIR/FULL DAVID-%%.*;%

        EDIT             -  This command will  bring up the editor.  Some
                            VAX  systems use a type of editor similar  to
                            MS-DOS/PC-DOS's  EDLIN.   HOWEVER,  some  VAX
                            systems  use EDT/EVE editing which is a  full
                            screen  editor (usually).  With this  editor,
                            you  can do a lot quickly, but only  if  your
                            terminal will support cursor control.  VT-100
                            is very clumsy.  Try getting VT-220 when you
                            use the EDT/EVE editor.
