changes to dmc.com.]

           The Info-VAX Monthly Posting
           ----------------------------
           PART 4 -- How to find software.
           (Coordinated by Dick Munroe, written by many others)

(Part 1 is an introduction to Info-VAX.  Part 2 is Beginner Common Questions.
Part 3 is Advanced Common Questions.)

This is NOT an introduction to navigation on the Internet.  Nor is it intended
to supplant other official "how to find ..." FAQs.  It is intended to be a
collection of pointers to commonly used/requested VMS software.  Whenever
possible the pointers will be to the "official" support site.  Pointers to
widely known software archives will be included here from time to time.

In general, all of the software discussed here either has been or soon will be
available from DECUS either as a seperate package or on the DECUS CDROMs.  If
all else fails, you can always get things through your local DECUS librarian or
[shudder] buy your own copy.

I'm also soliciting reviews of any of the software discussed in here from users.

Thanks,

Dick Munroe

,ANONYMOUS-UUCP

Some sites provide anonymous uucp access to VMSNET.SOURCES and a variety
of other software.

        Make sure that your chat script sets parity to zero or you won't
        make it past the DECServer.  U*x boxes should try "" P_ZERO as
        the first two tokens of their chat scripts if they have trouble
        getting in.

        Further information can be gotten by transfering:

                ~/listings/README.

        Which describes the contents of the archives and how to transfer
        things.  Briefly, you have access to the latest DECUS L&T CDROM,
        VMSNET.SOURCE, COMP.SOURCES.*, COMP.BINARIES.MAC, and any other
        software in use at dmc.com (some GNU products, MX, DECUS UUCP,
        etc.)  If you would like other things archived, send
        suggestions/requests to postmaster@dmc.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
,BBS

The only public domain VAX based BBS that I know of is available from:

	MAILSERV@ualr.edu
or
	MAILSERV%ualr.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu

Start by sending a message to the mailserv with the body of the message being:

HELP
INDEX

And go from there.  A copy of this BBS has been posted to VMSNET.SOURCES, so it
should also be available from an archive site near you.

At least one person (Roger Smith, SMITH@biosci.arizona.edu) has reported that
MAILSERV@ualr.edu has bounced messages recently.

There is at least one commercially developed BBS available (I'm not an owner or
user of this software, I just know about it).  Contact OMTOOL in Salem, New
Hampshire, USA for details.

If anybody knows of other commercial or public domain BBSs for VMS, please
contact me so I can update this listing.

Dick Munroe

I got a pointer to another commercial BBS.  The following message is from one of
the developers.  The product name is Huddle and is available from Innovative
Software in Denver, Col.  As before, I'm not a user or a principal in the
company, just an interested bystander.

>From: Jay Whitney <jw@innovative.com>
>Subject: Your Huddle request
>
>Huddle is a commercial electronic conferencing and bulletin board system for
>VMS.  Its primary catch point is ease of use.  Huddle offers three different
>user interfaces; two are command-based, with an intuitive command set based on
>VMS MAIL (of those two, one is screen oriented, and one is not), the third is a
>panel-oriented, user-extendable menu a-la Lotus 1-2-3 and MS-word.
>
>Huddle also features hierarchical conferencing.  A conference can support any
>number of subconferences, where the aggregate structure can be managed as a
>single unit.  Maintenance is very simple.  Once a maintenance policy has been
>defined, implementation of the maintenance policy is 100% automated.  Access
>control is very similar to standard VMS mechanisms.
>
>Huddle also offers built-in bidirectional Bitnet/Internet mailing list
>integration, file upload and download, a file transfer area, and a system news
>facility.

,CMU-OpenVMS-IP

>The End of an Era...

>
>What happens now?
>
>CMU has made an arrangement with Tektronix to remove their name from

>This version is nearly identical to the CMU-TEK 6.6-5 kit, so

>
>The installation savesets for CMU-OpenVMS/IP will be stored on

>contain a CMU-OpenVMS/IP V6.3 kit for those users who are still
>using VMS V4.4 through V4.7.  Instructions on how best to retrieve
>and install the software are available there in README.CMUIP.  In
>addition, these kits will also be placed in the DECUS Library and
>available for distribution after January 1, 1993.  You can contact

>
>"Support" for the product will continue on a volunteer-based system

[Ed. note: I have found copies of the release available via FTP on
csus.edu in the following directories:

        /pub/cmuip/contrib      - User contributions to CMUIP.
        /pub/cmuip/vms-v4       - The version of CMUIP know to work
                                  against VMS V4
        /pub/cmuip/vms-v5       - Ditto for V5 and higher.

The mailing list is gatewayed to

        vmsnet.networks.tcp-ip.cmu-tek

for those of you who prefer news group interaction.  There appears to be
much more traffic there now and as near as I can tell, better support. 
Anyway, more people are responding faster.

I received official confirmation of csus.edu as a mirror site in a later
message, below.]

>Since we are quite fond of the former CMU/Tek package, still rely on it
>for some of our machines, and need to keep a copy around anyway, we have

>PLEASE NOTE that we are doing this as a convenience to the network community -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
,FTPMAIL

Many sites are not directly connected to the internet.  Yet much of the software
or information we want access to is not available from mail servers.  In the
United States (there may be other sites, but I've never had reason to access
them) I have found the FTPMAIL service of DEC Western Research Labs to be
invaluable.  To get information, send a message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with a
message body consisting of the single line:

help

ftpmail and other mechanisms are discussed periodically in the news.answers
newsgroup.

Good Luck,

Dick Munroe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
,GCC
,GNUSOFT

The official FTP site for all GNU software is prep.ai.mit.edu.  They even have
the basics there for GCC.  For those of you interested in G++ (the GNU C++
compiler) for VMS you should try FTP from mango.rsmas.miami.edu.  They keep
current copies of G++ and G++lib in VMS installable form available.  I have also
found a mail based file server, MRCServ@mtroyal.ab.ca which also keeps current
copies of G++ and G++lib in VMS installable form.

Good Luck,

,NEWS

[Ed. Note -- This was cribbed from the news.software.anu-news FAQ.  There
is an beta version of ANU News, 6.1b* that is available as well.  I don't know
if it is available from these sites as well, but I believe it is.  6.1a4 is
packaged as part of the UUCP 2.0 release, so if you're getting that, you don't
need to get a copy unless you want to get the documentation/sources, or the
latest versions.

RZSZ.TLB is, I believe, also available from most of the VMS software archives
(cerritos.edu carries it).  I checked to see if there were other copies of
ZMODEM around.

UUNET has [at least] the following, most of which SHOULD be in source form:

The protocol documentation is in:

In addition, the VAX Software list (see SOFTWARE-LIST, above) mentions the
following:

SZ Shell        SZ Shell gives the Z-Modem program SZ a host of new features
                including wildcards and various others.  Both SZ and RZ are
                provided in the archive.
                Availability:   F47

F47     AB20.LARC.NASA.GOV

and

ZMODEM          File transfer between Vax and Unix/PC/Amiga computers.
                Availability:   S14, F15

S14     MRCserv@Janus.MtRoyal.AB.CA
F15     WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL

F = FTP
S = Mail Server

That's all I could find with a quick look.
