        TYPE             -  Shows the contents of a file by sending it to
                            the terminal.
                            EX: TYPE DAVID.TXT;3
        THE SET COMMAND:
        ===============

           The  SET command is one of the most widely used and  versatile
        commands on the VMS 5 series DCL.

        SET FILE/PROTECTION:
        ===================

           I suppose the most frequent use of SET involved the PROTECTION
        option.  These protections, known as SOGW or UIC protections, can
        be  put  on any file or directory that you have WRITE  &  EXECUTE
        privileges on.  Setting the protection involves allowing  differ-
        ent users on the VAX to read, write, execute, or delete your file
        or  directory.   The FILE /PROTECTION option of SET  is  used  to
        accomplish this.  An example is:

        SET FILE/PROTECTION=OWNER:E david.exe;4

        If  you  typed  this  command in the DCL  for  a  program  called
        DAVID.EXE;4  (4 is the version number), then the owner (or  crea-
        tor)  of  the  file can do nothing to the file  but  execute  it.
        However, in another example:

        SET FILE/PROTECTION=OWNER:RWED david.exe;4

        you  are  going  to be able to "R"ead,  "W"rite,  "E"xecute,  and
        "D"elete  the  program.  The same applies to a  directory.   Just
        substitute  the  directory  name for the  filename  above.   When
        creating a directory, the SET  is set so that you may not  delete
        it.   As  discussed  previously, you will have to  issue  a  "SET
        PROTECTION  OWNER:D  dirname.dir;1" and  "DEL  dirname.dir;1"  to
        delete the directory.

           Other than the owner, UIC file protection can be placed on any
        of the following:

        WORLD - Any user on the system.
        GROUP - Any user in your group.
        OWNER - Only your account or matching UIC.
        SYSTEM - Anyone that has SYSPRV privileges or the octal UIC
                 groups.

        SET TERMINAL:
        ============

           This  is  VERY important to all of us who call  into  the  VAX
        system.  If you have a VT100 (not just ANSI), you can use:

        SET TERMINAL/DEVICE_TYPE=VT100

           Additional terminal settings are possible, for example:

        SET TERMINAL/WIDTH=80 - Sets width to 80 columns
        SET TERMINAL/ADVANCED_VIDEO = Sets 124 X 24 lines
        SET TERMINAL/ANSI_CRT = ANSI escape sequences
        SET TERMINAL/AUTOBAUD = Possibly gets higher baud rate
        SET TERMINAL/BROADCAST = Enable messages from SEND, MAIL & PHONE
        SET TERMINAL/DEVICE_TYPE=VT220 - Sets terminal type to VT220
        SET TERMINAL/ECHO = Enables echoing from DCL command line
        SET TERMINAL/FULLDUP = Enables full duplex
        SET TERMINAL/HANGUP = Causes account to log off if no carrier
        SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE - Shows device_type of terminal
        SET TERMINAL/PAGE=43 - Sets display length to 43 lines
        SET TERMINAL/TYPE_AHEAD = Sets type ahead function on
        SET TERMINAL/UNKNOWN - Used for ASCII device types
        SET TERMINAL/WRAP = Used to set wrap around feature

        All  of  the above denoted with a "=" rather than a  "-"  can  be
        changed  to  the opposite setting by placing a "NO"  directly  in
        front of the qualifiers.  EX: SET TERMINAL/NOECHO
