     Part 1: Using Command Procedures.
             ----- ------- ----------
     You  can  use  command procedures to automate  sequences  of 
commands that you use quite often.  For example,  if you  always 
se  the  DIRECTORY command after you move to  a  Sub-Directory 
here  work  files  are  kept,  you can write  a  simple  command 
procedure to issue the SET DEFAULT and DIRECTORY commands for you.  
he following example, GO_DIR.COM, contains two commands:
$ Set Default [perry.accounts]
$ directory
Instead of using each command alone,  you can execute  GO_DIR.COM 
with the @ command:
$ @Go_Dir

his  command tells the DCL command interpreter to read the  file 
O_DIR.COM and executes the commands in the file.   So the command 
nterpreter  sets  your  default  directory  to[PERRY.ACCOUNTS]  and 
sues the DIRECTORY command.

ote: DCL means Digital Command Language. (sorry)


Formatting Command Procedures 
---------- ------- ----------
    Use  the  DCL command CREATE to create and format a  command 
rocedure.   When you name the command procedure,  use the default 
ile type COM.  If you use this default, you don't have to use the 
ile type when you execute the procedure with the @ command.
Command  procedures  contain DCL commands that you want  the  DCL 
command  intepreter  to execute and data lines that are  used  by 
hese commands.  Commands must begin with a dollar sign.  You can 
tart the command string just  after the dollar sign.
Data lines do not start with a dollar sign.  Data lines are  used 
as  input  data for commands.   Data lines are used by  the  most 
ecently issued command.

he  following  examle shows command and data lines in a  command 
rocedure.
$ mail
SEND
HOMAS
Y MEMO
id you get my memo?

 Show users thomas
The first line is a command and must start with a "$".   The next 
ines  are data lines that are used by the mail  function;  these 
lines must not start with "$".
Using Multiple Lines for One Command
----- -------- ----- --- --- -------

    If  you are writing a command that includes many  qualifers, 
ou  can make the command procedure more readable by listing  the 
ualifers on seperate lines rather than running them  together.  To 
o this, use the hyphen as a continuation character.  Don't start 
he continued line with "$". For example:
$ print test.out -
          /after=18:00 -
         /copies=10 -
         /queue=lpb0:


xecuting Command Procedures
-------- ------- ----------
    You can execute command procedures in two modes: interactive 
nd  batch.   In  interactive mode,  the commands in the  command 
rocedure are executing as if you were typing them.   You  cannot 
xecute  any other commands from your computer.   In batch  mode, 
he   system  creates  a  seprate  process  to  run  the  command 
procedure.   After  you use a batch job you  can continue to  use 
e system while it executes.

xecuting Command Procedures Interactively
-------- ------- ---------- -------------
     To  execute a command procedure interactively,  type the "@" 
command followed by the file specifications.   If you don't enter 
e entire command specification, the system will use the current 
disk, directory, and file default. 
Changing Command Levels
-------- ------- ------
     A  command  level  is the DCL level  from  which  you  issue 
commands.   When  you log in and type commands at your  Computer, 
u  are issuing commands at your level zero.   If you execute  a 
procedure,  the commands in the procedure are executed at command 
evel  1.   When the procedure ends and the DCL prompt is on your 
creen, you are back at levil zero.
A System Login File
- ------ ----- ----
     If  a system login file exists,  it is executed  before  the 
personal  file.   When  the system login file  ends,  control  is 
assed to the personal login file.  System and group login files 
low  a  system manager to make sure certian files are  executed 
when a person logs in.
To make a system login file, you have to have a managers account, 
you use the name SYS$SYLOGIN to make the login file.

Personal Login Files
------- ----- -----
     
    After  executing a system or group login  file,  the  system 
xecutes  a  personal login file.   Use a personal login file  to 
execute  commands  that  you  want to  that  you  want  to  issue 
verytime you login.  Name the login command procedure LOGIN.COM 
d put it in the default login directory.

Defineing Parameters or Qualifers
--------- ---------- -- ---------
     You  can  create  a command procedure  that  specifies  only 
parameters and(or)  qualifers and then use the command  procedure 
thin a DCL command string.   This type of command procedure  is 
useful  when there is a set of parimeters or qualifiers that  you 
requently use with one or more particular commands.   To execute 
he command string where you would normally use the qualifiers or 
arameters.
For  example:  You could create a command procedure that contains 
these qualifiers.                 
/DEBUG/SYMBOL_TABLE/MAP/FULL/CROSS_REFERENCE

o  use this command procedure,  execute it on the  command  line 
here you would otherwise place qualifiers.   For example, if you 
ame  the  command  procedure  DEFLINK.COM,  you  would  use  the 
ollowing   command  line  to  link  to  an  object  module  name 
YNAPSE.OBJ with the qualifiers that you specified in the  command 
rocedure:
$ LINK SYNAPSE@DEFLINK

he  next  example shows a command procedure named PARM.COM  that 
contains parameters:
HAP1, CHAP2
To execute the procedure, use it in a command string in place of a 
parameter name: 
$ DIRECTORY @PARAM



s  the others in this set are completed,  they should stay in  a 
oup.
