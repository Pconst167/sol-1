<H1>Hacking Textfiles: VAX and VMS </H1>
<P>
The Operating System and Machine Family created by Digital has its own
interesting legion of fans and stadium of haters.  It's weird, it's old iron,
and some people swear it's amazingly stable. Regardless, it garnered a lot of
interest from hackers for decades, and files that implore the community to
check out these grand and fascinating machines were sprinkled quite liberally
on BBSes.
<P>
Most of the big names of hacking in the 1980's had at least one VAX or VMS
file to offer. Also, many people wrote humor files about VAXes; those are
in the <A HREF="/humor/COMPUTER">Computer Humor</A> section.
