TUTORIAL HELP

LOGGING INTO THE DECSERVER
==============================
To login to the DECserver you may be required by your server manager to enter  a
login password.  If you are not required to do so, go on to the next screen.  If
you are, here are the steps to take to log in.

1  Press <RETURN> twice; a number sign (#) appears along with an audible "beep".

2  Enter the  login  password.  (You get the password from your server manager.)
   For example, to log in with the password A1B2C3...

       <RETURN> <RETURN>            enter <RETURN> twice

       # A1B2C3                     type the password (which is not echoed)

3  If you make a mistake, the  prompt reappears (and the "beep")  to let you try
   again.  You have several chances to enter the correct password.

4  If you use a dial-in modem, you have 60 seconds to respond to  the  #  prompt
   with the correct password.  If you don't,  the server disconnects your modem.

If you do not need to enter a login password, press <RETURN> twice to  log  into
your DECserver.

When you log in, an introductory line of text appears...

      DECserver 200 Terminal Server V3.0 (BL20) - LAT V5.1

If your port  does not have a permanent username defined, enter your name (1  to
16  keyboard characters) after the following text appears...

      Please type HELP if you need assistance

      Enter username>

The Local> prompt appears after you type your username.

If your port does have a permanent username, here's what you see...

     Please type HELP if you need assistance

     Local>


USING ONLINE HELP
===================
Online help is documentation about DECserver commands that is stored  in  server
memory.  You can see this documentation interactively on your terminal while you
are using the DECserver.  The HELP command gives you access to online help.  You
can use it in two ways:

You can type HELP at the Local> prompt...

      Local> HELP

This generates a succession of HELP "frames", "menus", and prompts.  Frames  are
made  up of the information that can fit on one or more terminal screens.  Menus
are lists of topics you can choose from.

Alternatively, you can specify topics and subtopics  when  you  enter  the  HELP
command.  For example...

      Local> HELP SET PORT

This command  produces online documentation that describes the SET PORT command.

SOME DEFINITIONS
==================
The primary function of the DECserver is to allow you to connect  to  "services"
offered  on  your  network.  A service can be a computer system that you can use
just as though your terminal were attached directly to the system, or it can  be
a function offered by such a system. In addition,  services  can  be  set-up  to
allow access to printers,  dial-out  modems,  personal  computers  and  terminal
switches. To connect to a service, you only need to know the service name.

A "service node" is a computer system or server that offers services.

A "session" is a connection to a service.  You can have one or more simultaneous
sessions  with  one  service,  or more than one service.  The connection you are
using at any one time is called your "current  session". Your other sessions are
inactive, but can be resumed by using server commands or session switches.

"Service mode" is your environment  when  you  interact  with  a  service.   For
example,  if the service is a computer system, your environment is the same as a
terminal directly wired to the system.  You can all use  the  system's  commands
and resources.

"Local mode" is your environment when you  interact  with  the  DECserver  using
commands entered at the Local> prompt.
  
CONNECTING TO A SERVICE==========================
Use the local mode SHOW SERVICES command to display a list of services you  can
use.

      Local> SHOW SERVICES

To connect to a service  (establish  a  session  with  the  service)  enter  the
DECserver  CONNECT  command with the name of the service you want.  For example,
for a service called SALES, enter the following command:

      Local> CONNECT SALES

This  command  places you  in  service  mode  in  an  active  session  with  the
service SALES.

RETURNING TO LOCAL MODE FROM A SERVICE SESSION=====================================================
To return to local mode without ending your session, press <BREAK> or press your
local  switch  character.   Both  these  characters  are,  in  effect, DECserver
commands that instruct the server to go back to local mode.

The <BREAK> character must be set up to permit this (by default it is), and  the
local switch character must be defined (by default it is not).

Use the HELP command for more details on setting up the  <BREAK> character  and
local switch character.

                                      NOTE

        Some modems interpret the  BREAK  character as a command to  end
        your  dial-in connection.  If you are using one of these modems,
        do not use <BREAK> to return to local mode.

Your session, now inactive, is still your current  session  because  it  is  the
session your were using most recently.

RESUMING YOUR SERVICE SESSION FROM LOCAL MODE
====================================================
To resume your current session (and service mode) while your are in local  mode,
enter the DECserver RESUME command.

      Local> RESUME

You go back to where you left off before returning to local mode.

DISCONNECTING FROM A SERVICE
=================================
To end your current  session  while  in  service  mode,  use  the  command  that
terminates  whatever  process  you  are using.  For example, you can terminate a
session on a VAX/VMS system by typing the VMS  LOGOUT  command.   Refer  to  the
documentation for the service node that offers the service.

To end your current session while in local mode, enter the DECserver  DISCONNECT
command.

      Local> DISCONNECT

You  cannot  resume  a  service  session  after  you  end  the  connection  with
DISCONNECT.


CONNECTING TO A SECOND SERVICE
==================================
The DECserver allows you to have several sessions at one time, to the same or to
different services. To connect to a second (or subsequent) service, simply enter
another CONNECT command from local mode, specifying the name of the service. For
example, to connect to the service PRODUCTION, enter the following command:

      Local> CONNECT PRODUCTION

To resume one of your non-current sessions, use the FORWARDS command  to  switch
to your next session,  or the BACKWARDS  command  to  switch  to  your  previous
session.  Alternatively,  you can use the RESUME command and specify the session
number.  You can find this number from the SHOW SESSIONS display:

      Local> RESUME SESSION 2

To disconnect a particular session,  use the DISCONNECT command  and specify the
session number. For example:

      Local> DISCONNECT SESSION 1

LOGGING OUT OF THE DECSERVER
================================
To logout from the DECserver, enter  the  DECserver  LOGOUT  command  (in  local
mode).

      Local> LOGOUT

LOGOUT disconnects all sessions.  A  DECserver  message  appears  verifying  the
logout.

Topic? help
HELP

HELP gives you on-line information about  DECserver  commands.   HELP  lets  you
progress through a series of menus or enter specific HELP topics.

HELP [topic] [subtopic(s)]

Specify a topic or subtopic(s) when you need information about specific parts of
commands (e.g., HELP SHOW PORTS ACCESS).


The following conventions are used in the HELP descriptions:

o Slashes (/) in the title for a HELP topic mean that the text applies  to  more
  than one command or optional keyword.

o Lowercase words in command syntax (for example, port-name) mean that you enter
  a value from a list of possible values.

o Upper case keywords in command syntax (for example, SET PORT)  mean  that  you
  enter these keywords as shown.

o Brackets around a keyword or value, for example,  [LOCAL],  indicate  options.
  Choose one and only one option.

o Braces around keywords or values, for example, {DYNAMIC}, mean you must choose
  one and only one of the included words.


You may perform any of the following actions while using online HELP:

o Type a question mark (?) to  any  help  prompt  to  redisplay  the  HELP  text
  associated with that prompt.

o Press the RETURN key to return to the previous (sub)topic level.  If  you  are
  at the Topic?  prompt level, you will return to the Local>  prompt.

o Enter a (sub)topic keyword at the continuation prompt, resulting in the  frame
  associated with that keyword.

o Enter <CTRL/Z>  to exit HELP from any prompt or level.

You may abbreviate any topic keyword following the same rules set forth for  the
DECserver's local mode command language.

================
Topic? backwards
================
BACKWARDS

BACKWARDS lets  you  resume  your  'previous'  service  session  -  the
session with the next lower session number than the current session. If
your current session is session  one,  the  session  with  the  highest
session number will be resumed.

BACKWARDS

If you have only one active session, that session resumes.

Topic? forwards

FORWARDS

Use this command to resume your 'next' service session  -  the  session
with the next higher session number than the current session.  If  your
current session is already the highest session number, session one will
be resumed.

FORWARDS

If you have only one active session, that session resumes.

Topic? resume

RESUME

Use this command to resume a session when you are in local mode.   If you do not
specify a session number, your current session resumes.

RESUME [SESSION number]

Topic? broadcast
================
BROADCAST

Use BROADCAST to send  a  message  to  other  DECserver  ports.   Your
message  appears  at  the  destination port device unless BROADCAST is
disabled for the port or the port device does not currently have local
access.

BROADCAST PORT port-number {"message-text"}
                           { message-text }

The message-text may contain up to 115 keyboard  characters.   If  you
enclose it in quotation marks ("), it is broadcast exactly as you type
it.  If not, the server sends it in uppercase characters.

Additional help available for:

PORT

BROADCAST Subtopic? port

SET Subtopic? port

DEFINE/SET PORT

Use DEFINE PORT to change the port characteristics that  take  effect  when  the
port  is  next  logged in.  Use SET PORT to change the port characteristics that
you wish to take effect immediately,  but only stay in effect until port logout.

{DEFINE} PORT port-characteristic(s)
{SET   }

port-characteristic(s)      are one or more port characteristics options

DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? autoconnect

DEFINE/SET PORT AUTOCONNECT
=================================

AUTOCONNECT allows the server to automatically connect the port  to  a  service.

AUTOCONNECT operates upon abnormal termination of a connection or  upon  failure
to  establish  a  requested  connection.   With a dedicated service or preferred
service, AUTOCONNECT automatically makes a connection to the  service  when  the
port user logs in.

AUTOCONNECT {ENABLED }
            {DISABLED}  *

ENABLED allows the AUTOCONNECT function.  DISABLED inhibits AUTOCONNECT.


DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? flow control
=======================================
DEFINE/SET PORT FLOW CONTROL

FLOW CONTROL specifies the characters or signals that control
data flow at your port. 

FLOW [CONTROL] {CTS     }
               {DISABLED}
               {DSR     }
               {XON     }  *

CTS means that CTS/RTS modem signals implement flow control.

DISABLED means that flow control is disabled.

DSR means that DSR/DTR modem signals implement flow control.

XON means that XON/XOFF characters implement flow control.

When using CTS or DSR flow control, MODEM CONTROL must be DISABLED.

You can specify a single direction for flow control.  If  you  do  not,  control
applies to both ingoing and outgoing data.

{INPUT } FLOW [CONTROL] {ENABLED }  *
{OUTPUT}                {DISABLED}

INPUT controls data flow from your port device to the server port.

OUTPUT controls data flow from the server port to your port device.

DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? message codes
DEFINE/SET PORT MESSAGE CODES

MESSAGE CODES specifies whether message numbers appear  with  status  and  error
messages.

MESSAGE [CODES] {ENABLED }  *
                {DISABLED}

ENABLED permits the codes to appear. DISABLED inhibits message codes.

DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? remote modification

DEFINE/SET PORT REMOTE MODIFICATION

Use REMOTE MODIFICATION to control whether port characteristics can be modified 
remotely by the service node side of a session.

REMOTE [MODIFICATION] {ENABLED }
                      {DISABLED} *

ENABLED specifies that port characteristics may be modified remotely.

DISABLED specifies that port characteristics can not be modified remotely.

DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? autoprompt
DEFINE/SET PORT AUTOPROMPT

AUTOPROMPT  determines  whether  a  service's  login   prompt   is   transmitted
automatically to the port when a session starts.  Set AUTOPROMPT to DISABLED for
remote access ports or for port devices without keyboards.

AUTOPROMPT {ENABLED }  *
           {DISABLED}

ENABLED allows automatic appearance of a login message and prompt.

DISABLED inhibits a service's login message and prompt until the
user enters <RET>. 


DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? speed

DEFINE/SET PORT SPEED
========================

SPEED specifies the port speed.  It must match the speed parameter for the  port
device.  Use the INPUT and OUTPUT keywords for split speed operation.

[INPUT ] SPEED speed
[OUTPUT]      

The speed value can be one of:

75, 110, 134, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2000, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200

The default is 9600.

INPUT is directed from the port device to the server.

OUTPUT is directed from the server to the port device.

DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? backward switch
DEFINE/SET BACKWARD SWITCH

Use BACKWARD SWITCH to set up a special character that allows you
to switch to the previous session for the port.

BACKWARD [SWITCH] {character}
                  {NONE     }  *

Control characters are recommended for switch characters.

NONE deletes a previous BACKWARD SWITCH character.

DEFINE/SET PORT Subtopic? forward switch

DEFINE/SET PORT FORWARD SWITCH

Use FORWARD SWITCH to set up a special character that allows you
to switch to the next session for the port. 

FORWARD [SWITCH] {character}
                 {NONE     }  *

Control characters are recommended for switch characters.

NONE deletes a previous FORWARD SWITCH character.
