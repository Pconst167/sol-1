through various text files and notes and buffer captures.  All the defaults
I could find are on here.  Everyone of the accounts could also have
NO PASSWORD, so try <cr> too.  Theres no end to stupidity.  The most likely
to the no password accounts are the guest and demo accounts.

If you have any other default accounts, or ones that keep seeming to
pop onto different systems, or if you know some of the default passwords
to accounts w/out passwords on this list please update this file.
