
                      WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF "V A X"
          You will find within the following pages some basically 
        accurate and somewhat useful information on using the VAX-D.  
        The extent of what is given is GUARNTEED to be enough to get 
        you onto the VAX SYSTEM and far enough along to get into some 
        real trouble. Once you have advanced to this plateau of 
        expertise..............GOOD LUCK..!!!!!


Let's get started:

        1. The first operation you need to perform is to..
           turn the terminal on.  You will find a switch 
           located on the right side just underneath the 
           keyboard.....FLIP IT.!

        2. Now if the terminal has responded with a 'BEEP'
           (That is it's way of saying HELLO ..)
        
        
        3. First it wants to know 'WHICH SYSTEM WOULD YOU LIKE?'.
             Since it is trying to be friendly let's cooperate.
             At this point, you need to type 'VAXD'.

           IT will now ask you for a 'USERNAME'
             (this is the number that your instructor (hopefully)
             has given you)  It will begin with a 'D' followed by
             six numbers beginning with '35????'. ENTER IT.!

           The next response you should expect is 'PASSWORD'
             followed by a string of X's.  At this point you
             will enter the remaining four characters or numbers
             that your instructor should have given you.

           Since your password has been entered, VAX will print
             a second string of X's (this is supposed to gobble
             up your password so no one else can see it....but
             then nobody's perfect), followed by a few lines of
             garbage such as Good morning/afternoon! (depending
             on the time of day obviously) something about NEWS
             (this can be read when you need to look busy and
             have nothing else to do!), and last but not least
             it really out does itself and gives you a '$'.

CONGRATULATIONS...!!!!!!!! you are now on the VAXD

              (just a note: If you read the capital letters
               under topic 3, you will notice they spell a
               word.   F-I-T-S  This is what the VAX will
               whole-heartily give you...at no monetary charge
               to you of course)  

       





                     INTERESTING THINGS TO DO


        All of the following commands are only used at the '$' prompt.


        1. DIR - Directory - gives you a listing of the files in 
                             your account.

        2. TY  - Type      - allows you to type an existing file
                             found in the directory.
                           
                             TY filename.ext;v

                             without using an extension number,
                             the VAX will type the most recent 
                             Version (v) of your file.

        3. HELP -          - You will find that this command 
                             will be very useful when you are
                             starting out, but will be used 
                             less as you become more proficient 
                             with the system.
                             DO NOT..!!!! print this file out.
                             a copy is available for use in the
                             COMPUTER CENTER.

        4. CONTROLS        - These are function keys that may
                             be used at any time.  They are 
                             used by holding down the 'CTRL'
                             key on the left side of the keyboard
                             and pressing the associated key.
                              CTRL is denoted with an '^'

                             ^C / ^Y Cancels (anything)
                              (suggest to use this key with caution
                               as files may be lost).

                             ^Z Performs basically the same
                              function as ^C or ^Y , but "closes"
                              the file before it cancels.

                              (also used to exit from the insert
                               mode of the EDITOR).

                             ^L Clears the Screen.

                             ^S Stops a listing on the Screen.

                             ^Q Restarts a listing that
                                      has been stopped.

       



        5. DEL - DELETE   - Allows individual deletion of files from
                            your account.  Be sure to specify the 
                            Version number (V) else all files with the
                            name used will be deleted.

                            ex:

                            DEL VAXPG1.BAS;2

                            This will delete only the Version 2 of 
                            the VAXPG1.BAS program.  If Versions 1 & 3
                            were existent on the DIR (account) they 
                            would remain untouched.

        6. PU - PURGE     - Will purge ALL but the most recent Version 
                            of a program in your account.  Primarily used
                            for cleaning up your files, and frees up 
                            block space so that you may add more files.
                            Be certain that the most recent Version showing
                            on your DIRectory is a complete and some what
                            accurate program.

                            ex:

                            $ PU

                            Will PURGE Versions 1 & 2 of VAXPG1.BAS and
                            leave only Version 3.
                            (note: the $ is not typed in by the user)

       






                        NOW LET'S MESS UP SOME FILES



        The easiest way to get frustrated is to try and edit a
        file.  This will assist you in your frustration.

        1. At the '$' prompt, you have access to two editors.
           Experience has taught me that the 'EDT' editor is
           the easiest to manipulate.  The following will be
           exclusively 'EDT' commands, for information on the
           'SOS' editor and additional information on the 'EDT'
           editor, use the help file (ie:$ HELP EDIT/EDT).
            (note: again the $ is not typed in by the user)

        2. Let's create a file....

           At the '$' type 'EDIT filename.ext', and then press
           the 'NEWLINE' key.  Now I know you are thinking...
           what is "filename.ext", well "filename" is a name of
           a program that you select, and "ext" is the extension 
           you wish to associate you filename.  Now that you 
           are totally confused, allow me to assist you.

           $ EDIT VAXPG1.BAS 'NEWLINE'

           The above statement creates a file called VAXPG1.BAS.
           the VAX will assign a Version number reflecting how 
           many times the program has been edited. Obviously 
           this will be Version 1 since there was not a file to 
           begin with.

           After the above is typed, the VAX will respond with:

             Input file does not exist
             [EOB]
             *

           This is telling you that the file is new, and the 
           [EOB] represents 'End Of Buffer', or End of Program.
           The '*' is the prompt given by the editor command mode.

           These are commonly used Editor Commands.

                1. I - Insert - allows you to enter lines 
                                into your program.
                                a "CTRL-Z" (^Z) exits you 
                                from the insert mode and  
                                saves the lines.

                2. D - Delete - allows you to delete one or
                                more lines from your program.
                               
                                ex: 
                                   D1 - deletes line #1
                                   D5 - deletes line #5
                                   D1:5 - deletes lines
                                         #1 through #5.

                3. S - Substitute - allows you to make changes
                                within a line of text.
    
                                ex: 
                                   THIS IS A TEDT LINE

                                   In the above line of text,
                                   the command:

                                   *S/TEDT/TEXT/'NEWLINE'

                                   changes it to:
    
                                   THIS IS A TEXT LINE
       




                4. T - Tab -   allows you to "jump around" in
                               your program.

                               ex:

                                  *T1 - tabs to line 1
                                  *T5 - tabs to line 5
                                  *T1:5 - prints lines 1 through 5.

                5. RES -       Allows you RESEQUENCE lihne numbers
                               in intervals of "1". (Inserted lines
                               get REnumbered with integers, including
                               any "added lines" in multiples of 0.1).

                6. FIND END
                   SHOW BUFFER - Typing these statements in succession
                                 will show you the end of your file. 
                                 (useful whenever you want to 'extend'
                                 a file that you entered at an earlier
                                 time or date)


        Now all we need to do is get out of the EDITOR. There are
        two ways in which to do this:

                1. EXIT - Gets you out of the EDITOR and makes
                          ALL changes to your program.

                2. QUIT - Gets you out of the EDITOR and does 
                          not make any changes to the program.

                 (note: every time you call a program under an EDITOR
                  the VAX will create a new Version. VAX-D will only 
                  allow you three Versions of any given program.  Be
                  careful not to inadvertently erase or delete your 
                  program when using the EDITOR.  Be certain that 
                  when you run the program, you use the most recent
                  Version number.

LET'S RUN A PROGRAM:

        If and only if you are using the WYLBUR accounts, do you need
        be concerned with the following.

(job card)      //jobname JOB (ACCT),'your name(ND)',PASSWORD=PSWD
(print card)    /*ROUTE PRINT RMT05    
(exec card)     /*      EXEC *********  (*'s indicate compiler
                                         ie:COBOL,PLIXGO,WATFOR,etc.)

(program)           ** YOUR PROGRAM GOES HERE **

(end of prog)   /*
(input card)    //SYSIN  DD  *

(data)              ** YOUR DATA GOES HERE **

(end of file    /*

                
                 ** (note: Depending on your instructor and the
                     language used, dictates the use of the above.
                     If this procedure is to be used, ALL of the
                     above cards are required. There may be 
                     minor differences in the cards 
                     ie: COBOL -vs- WATBOL etc..)

       





TO SEND A JOB TO MORGANTOWN....

               $ SEND filename.ext;v

               (Do not press 'NEWLINE' and wait for the 'File_:'
                 response to enter your program name, this does 
                 not work at the present time)
               
               Will return a message that file has been queued.
                           IT'S GONE..!!!!!


               You will not be able to check on your job status
               using the 'SEND' command... so it's hurry up 
               and wait time.



NOW WHAT TO DO..???
             
               So here you sit apearing to be intellectual and
               intelligent, staring at the tube which is staring
               back at you and doing absloutely nothing..!! and
               far to proud to embarrass yourself by asking 
               someone what to do..

               The prompt awaiting you is a '$'. you may begin
               again and edit a new file or.. if you wish...
               and I imagine you do... you would like to leave.
               This is easily done by typing LOGOFF (or just
               'LO' will work).. ah! embarrassment saved..!

GOOD LUCK.!!
