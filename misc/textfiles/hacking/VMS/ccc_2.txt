INTRODUCTION
------------


       Perhaps the most exciting Operating system to HACK on is VAX/VMS.
It offers many challenges for hackers and boasts one of the best security
systems ever developed.  In comparison to the security on UNIX, VMS is far
superior in every respect.  It can be very difficult to get inside such a
system and even harder to STAY inside, but isn't that what this is all about?!
I have written this file as a way for beginning hackers to learn about the VMS
operating system.  There is such a vast amount of information that can be
related about VAX/VMS hacking that it is not possible for me to cover
everything in just one file.  As such i will try and stick to the basics for
this file and hopefully write another file in the future that deals with
heavy-duty kernal programming, the various data structures, and system service
calls. All right so lets get at it!




GETTING IN
----------

       First of all how do you recognize a VAX when you see one?! Well the
thing that always gives a VAX away, is when you logon you will see:

Username:

It may also have some other info before it asks you for the username, usually
identifying the company and perhaps a message to the effect of:

Unauthorized Users will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law!

That should get you right in the mood for some serious hacking!  Ok so when you
have determined that the system you have logged into is indeed a VAX, you will
have to at this point enter your SYSTEM LOGIN.  Basically on VAX's there are
several default logins which will get you into the system. However on MOST
systems these default logins are changed by the system manager. In any case,
before you try any other logins, you should try these (since some system
managers are lazy and don't bother changing them):

Username           Password        Alternate
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM             MANAGER         OPERATOR
FIELD              SERVICE         TEST
DEFAULT            DEFAULT         USER
SYSTEST            UETP            SYSTEST
DECNET             DECNET          NONPRIV


That's it. Those are the default system users/passwords.  The only ones on the
list that are GUARANTEED to be in the userlist are SYSTEM and DEFAULT. However,
I have never come across a system where these two haven't been changed from
their default passwords to something else.  In the above list, the alternate
password is simply a password many operators set the password to from the
deafult. So if the first password doesn't work, try the alternate password.  It
should be noted when the a user is added into the system, the default password
for the new user the SAME as his username.  You should keep this point in mind
because it is VERY important. Most of the accounts you hack out, will be found
in this way! Ok if above ones don't work,  then you should try these accounts.
These following accounts are NOT defaults, but through experience i have found
that many systems use these accounts or some variation thereof:

Username           Password
---------------------------
VAX                VAX
VMS                VMS
DCL                DCL
DEC                DEC       *
DEMO               DEMO      *
TEST               TEST      *
NETNONPRIV         NONPRIV   *
NETPRIV            PRIV
ORACLE             ORACLE    *
ALLIN1             ALLIN1    *
INGRES             INGRES    *
GUEST              GUEST     *
GAMES              GAMES
BACKUP             BACKUP    *
HOST               HOST
USER               USER      *
DIGITAL            DIGITAL
REMOTE             REMOTE    *
SAS                SAS
FAULT              FAULT
USERP              USERP
VISITOR            VISITOR
GEAC               GEAC
VLSI               VLSI
INFO               INFO      *
POSTMASTER         MAIL
NET                NET
LIBRARY            LIBRARY
OPERATOR           OPERATOR  *
OPER               OPER

The ones that have asterisks (*) beside them are the more popular ones and you
have a better chance with them, so you should try them first. It should be
noted that the VAX will not give you any indication of whether the username
you typed in is indeed valid or not.  Even if you type in a username that does
not exist on the system, it will still ask you for a password.  Keep this in
mind because if you are not sure if whether an account exists or not, don't
waste your time in trying to hack out its password. You could be going on a
wild goose chase!  You should also keep in mind that ALL bad login attempts are
kept track of and when the person logs in, he is informed of how many failed
attempts there were on his account.  If he sees 400 login failures, I am sure
that he will know someone is trying to hack his account.




THE BASICS
----------

Ok i am assuming you tried all the above defaults and managed to get yourself
into the system. Now the real FUN begins!  Ok first things first. After you log
in you will get some message about the last time you logged in etc. If this is
the first time you have logged into this system then you should note the last
login date and time and WRITE IT DOWN! This is important for several reasons.
The main one being that you want to find out if the account you have just
hacked is an ACTIVE or INACTIVE account.  The best accounts are the inactive
ones. Why?! Well the inactive accounts are those that people are not using
currently, meaning that there is a better chance of you holding onto that
account and not being discovered by the system operator.  If the account has
not been logged into for the last month or so, theres a good chance that it
is inactive.  Ok anyhow once your in, if you have a normal account with access
to DCL you will get a prompt that looks like:

$

This may vary from machine to machine but its usually the same. If you have a
weird prompt and would like a normal one, type:

$set prompt=$

If this is the first time you have hacked into this system there are a couple
of steps you should take immediately. First type:

$set control=(y,t)

This will enable your break keys (like ctrl-c) so that you can stop a file or
command if you make a mistake.  Usually ctrl-c is active, but this command will
insure that it is. (Note: in general to abort a command, or program you can
type ctrl-c or ctrl-y) Ok anyhow, the next step is to open the buffer in your
terminal then type:

$type sys$system:rightslist.dat

This will dump a file that has all the systems users listed in it.  You may
notice a lot of weird garbage characters. Don't worry about those, that is
normal.  Ok after this file ends and you get the shell prompt again ($) then
save the buffer, clear it out and leave it open. Then type:

$show logical

Ok after this file is buffered save it also.  Ok at this point you have two
files on your disk which will help you hack out MORE accounts on the system.
For now, lets find out how powerful the account you currently hacked into is.
You should type:

$set proc/priv=all

This may give you a message telling you that all your privileges were not
granted. That's ok. Now type:

$show proc/priv

This will give you a list of all the privileges your account is set up for.
Usually most user accounts only have NETMBX and TMPMBX privs.  If you have
more than these two, then it could mean that you have a nice high-level user.
Unlike UNIX which only has a distinction between user and superuser, VMS has
a whole shitload of different privileges you can gain.  The basic privs are as
follows:

PRIVILEGE      DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NONE           no privilege at all


NORMAL PRIVS
------------
MOUNT          Execute mount volume QIO
NETMBX         Create network connections (you need this to call out!)
TMPMBX         Create temporary mailbox


GROUP PRIVS
-----------
GROUP          Control processes in the same group
GRPPRV         Group access through SYSTEM protection field


DEVOUR PRIVS
------------
ACNT           Disable accounting
ALLSPOOL       Allocate spooled devices
BUGCHK         Make bugcheck error log entries
EXQUOTA        Exceed disk quotas
GRPNAM         Insert group logical names n the name table
PRMCEB         Create/delete permanent common event flag clusters
PRMGBL         Create permanent global sections
PRMMBX         Create permanent mailboxes
SHMEM          Create/delete structures in shared memory


SYSTEM PRIVS
------------
ALTPRI         Set base priority higher that allotment
OPER           Perform operator functions
PSWAPM         Change process swap mode
WORLD          Control any process
SECURITY       Perform security related functions
SHARE          Access devices allocated to other users
SYSLCK         Lock system-wide resources


FILES PRIVS
-----------
DIAGNOSE       Diagnose devices
SYSGBL         Create system wide global sections
VOLPRO         Override volume protection


ALL PRIVS
---------
BYPASS         Disregard protection
CMEXEC         Change to executive mode
CMKRNL         Change to kernal mode
DETACH         Create detached processes of arbitrary UIC
LOG_IO         Issue logical I/O requests
PFNMAP         Map to specific physical pages
PHY_IO         Issue physical I/O requests
READALL        Possess read access to everything
SETPRV         ***  ENABLE ALL PRIVILEGES!!! ***
SYSNAM         Insert system logical names in the name table
SYSPRV         Access objects through SYSTEM protection field


Ok that's the lot of them! I will explain some of the more important privileges
later in the file.  For now, at least you can see just how powerful the account
is.  It should be noted that most accounts usually are only granted the TMPMBX
and NETMBX privileges, so if you don't have the others, don't fret too much.



GENERAL TERMINOLOGY
-------------------

    I think that i should clarify some of the basic concepts involved with
VAX/VMS operating systems before we go any further:

PROCESS: this is what is created when you log in.  The system sets aside CPU
         time and memory for you and calls it a process. Any task that is run
         in VMS is called a process.

SUBPROCESS: also known as child-process, this is just a process that was
            created by another process.

DCL    : Digital Command Language. This is the shell ($) that you are put into
         when you log into a VAX

MCR    : an alternate shell that is used (rarely) on certain accounts. Login
         prompt is a  >  as opposed to DCL which gives a  $
SHELL  : this is the '$' that you see once you are logged in. This is your
         interface with the system, where you can enter the various commands
         execute files and perform other activities.

JOB    : a process and a group of its subprocesses performing some task

SPAWN  : this is the actual command that allows you to create subprocesses
         'SPAWNING' is the act of creating subprocesses

PID    : process identification number. This is an 8 byte ID code that is
         uniquely given to each process that is created on the system.

IMAGE  : this is an EXE file that you can execute (ie run)

UIC    : User identification code. This is in two parts, namely: [group,member]
         The way this works is that users in the same group can access each
         others files through the group protection code.  However since the UIC
         MUST uniquely identify each user, the member portion separates the
         individuals in each group.  If an account does not have a different
         member number, he will NOT be put in the RIGHTSLIST database.



CONTROL KEYS
------------

 A brief note on control sequences.  Several different actions can be activated
via control sequences. They are:

CTRL-H  :delete last character
CTRL-B  :redisplay last command (can go back up to the last 20 commands issued)
CTRL-S  :pause display
CTRL-Q  :continue after pause
CTRL-Z  :*EXIT* use to break out of things such as CREATE and EDIT
CTRL-C  :*CANCEL* will exit out of most operations
CTRL-Y  :*INTERRUPT* will break out of whatever you are doing
CTRL-T  :print out statistical info about the process

NOTE: sometimes upon login, the CTRL-Y, CTRL-C keys are disabled.  To ensure
      these are enabled, issue this command upon login:

$ SET CONTROL


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: all the commands that are executed from DCL can be referenced from an
      online help manual.  To access this, simply type help at any '$' prompt
      This help is also available within the various utilities and programs
      such as authorize and mail. The two MOST important commands are SET and
      SHOW. These should be buffered and printed out for your own reference.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FILES and DIRECTORIES
---------------------

 The directory structure of VMS is a heirarchical one similar to MS-DOS and
UNIX. Its a simple concept, and i will only briefly skim over it.  First of all
it should be noted that there may be more than one hard drive or other
mass-storage device hooked up to your system. Within each hard drive there is
the ROOT directory. This is the highest directory in the tree and is referenced
by [000000]. (this will be explained in a minute)  Within the root there are
several subdirectories. Within these subdirectories there may be files and even
further subdirectories.  The concept is quite simple, but can be difficult to
explain.  Here is a diagram to give you a rough idea of how it is set up:



                                 [000000] <--root directory
                                     !
                                     !
          +--------------------------+---------------------------------+
          !                          !                                 !
          !                          !                                 !
        [d1]                       [d2]                              [d3]
          !                          !                                 !
    +-----+--------+           +-----+-----+                  +--------+
    !     !        !           !           !                  !        !
    !     !        !           !           !              [d3.d3a]  [d3.d3b]
 [d1.da] [d1.db] [d1.dc]    [d2.d2a]   [d2.d2b]
            !                  !           !
            !                  !        +--+-----------+
       [d1.db.db1]        [d2.d2a.d2a1] !              !
                                       [d2.d2b.d2b1] [d2.d2b.d2b2]




    Hopefully this will give you some sort of an idea of how the directories
can be structured. Within each subdirectory there may be other files also. For
example to see the directory after you log in you would type:

$dir

a sample result may be:


Directory DISK$SCHOOL:[REPORTS.JOHN]

average.com;3
generate.exe;1
mail.mai;10
marks.dat;4
marks.dat;5
reportcard.dir
projects.dir

Total 7 files.

What does this tell you? The first line tells you what drive and subdirectory
you are in. The next lines are the actual files. As you can see each file has
a 3 character extension, followed by a comma and a number.  The name before the
period is the actual filename (eg. average) the 3 characters after the period
is known as the extension (eg.com) and the number after the comma refers to the
version of the file. So in this case, this is version number 3.  Any time you
modify or save a file, it automatically assigns it a version number of 1. If
file already exists on your disk, it increments the version number by 1 and
then saves it as such.  So the next time i go ahead and save the file
average.com, it would add another file to the list called average.com;4
  Special note should be taken of the files that have an extension of '.DIR'
These are not really files, but rather subdirectories.  I will show you how to
switch subdirectories in just a minute. First you should take note of the
different file extensions.  Although you can name the files anything you want
some of the more important extensions are:

TYPE      DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXE       Executable IMAGE. These files are programs that can be RUN
COM       DCL SCRIPT files. These can also be executed, utilizing the @ command
DAT       DATA file. Sometimes useful things to look at.
LIS       Listing File, many times important info is in here
MAI       Mail file,  use the MAIL command to read these
DIR       DIRECTORY - not a file
JOU       Journal File, often created thru the use of other programs eg EDIT
TXT       Text Files, often hold useful information.

These are just some of the extensions you are most likely to see. The two
important ones are the EXE and COM files. These can be executed from the DCL
level. EXE files are executed via the RUN command. Eg. to run authorize.exe:

$run authorize

This will run the authorize IMAGE. Supposing there were more than one version
of authorize you could specify a version number. eg.

$run authorize.exe;4

The other type of file you can run is the COM files. These are like SCRIPT
files in UNIX or .BAT files from MS-DOS.  They are just a sequence of DCL
commands strung together that are executed when you initiate the file. To run
COM files, use the @ command. For example to run adduser.com, type:

$@adduser

The version number thing i stated for EXE files also applies for COM files.

***NOTE***  To get a listing of all the files on the whole drive, try this:

$sd [000000]
$dir [...]*.*

Similarly you type dir [...]*.com, if you wanted just the COM files listed.
To see the contents of a file, you can use the TYPE command. For example:

$type login.com

this might type out something like:

$ sd:==set default
$ set control=(y,t)
$ set proc/name=entity
$ set term/dev=vt100
         :
         :
         :
        etc

This is great for COM files, DAT files and some of the other types, but you
will always get garbage when you type EXE files so don't bother trying those.
This is very useful for snooping around other peoples files and getting
information. Many times i have found user/passwords lying around in TXT or
LIS files left by some careless user.

 Now, how do you go about changing directories? Well, first you should set up
a shortcut.  The normal command to change directories is SET DEFAULT. For
example to change to a subdirectory called REPORTS, you would have to type:

$set default [.reports]

To make life simpler on yourself, as soon as you log in, you should type:

$sd:==set default

This defines a macro called SD that is interpreted by DCL as SET DEFAULT. You
can similarly define other 'favorite' commands to some short, easy to remember
definition.  Anyhow heres the syntax for changing directories:

SD DEVICE:[dir1.dir2.dir3....]

The device can be optionally left out, if you plan to remain in the same hard
drive. You have to then enter a '[' followed by the root directory, followed
by a period, followed by another subdirectory name etc. Eg.

$sd dub0:[cosy.users]

Suppose at this point, you were in directory cosy, subdirectory users and there
was a further subdirectory called 'info.dir'.  Rather than specify the full
pathname, you can simply type:

$sd [.info]

This will advance you one level into the info subdirectory. Remember to put the
period in front of the subdirectory. If you don't, in this case it would assume
that you were trying to reference the root directory called info.  Another
important thing to note is moving back levels in terms of subdirectories. For
example if you were in [cosy.users.info] and wanted to move back to
[cosy.users] you could type:

$sd [-]

Similarly you can put in as many hyphens (-) as you want to move back. For
example  sd [--]  would put you back to the cosy directory.

Another important thing to note about subdirectories are logical assigned
symbols. These are names assigned to certain things. For example the main
system directory is called sys$system. So to go to it you could type:

$sd sys$system

This would throw you into the system directory. Similarly you can type:

$sd sys$login

and this will put you back into the directory that you were initially in, when
you first logged in.  These symbols stand for actual device:directory
combinations.  To see the various definitions that are assigned to each process
you should type:

$show logical

This will list a whole bunch of global system equates that you can use to
access various parts of the VAX structure.  In addition to view all of your
locally defined symbols, use:

$show symbol *



FILE PROTECTION
---------------

Ok before i begin this, let me just state that whatever i say about files also
applies to directories.  There are four types of file protections. There is
SYSTEM,WORLD,GROUP and OWNER. These are briefly:

SYSTEM- All users who have group numbers 0-8 and users with physical or logical
        I/O privileges  (generally system managers, system programmers, and
        operators)
OWNER - the owner of the file (or subdirectory), isolated via their User
        Identification Code (UIC). This means the person who created the file!
GROUP - All users who have the same group number in their UICs as the owner of
        the file.
WORLD - All users who do not fall in the categories above

Each file has four types of protection within each of the above categories.
They are: Read, Write, Execute, Delete. Explanations are:

READ   - You can read the file and copy it.
WRITE  - You can modify and rename that file.
EXECUTE- You can run the file
DELETE - You can delete the file

When you create a file the default is that you have all the privileges for that
particular file. Group, world and system may only have limited privileges. This
can be changed with the set protection DCL command. For example:

$set protection=(group:rwed,world:r)/default

would set your default protection to allow other users in your group to have
full read,write,execute,delete privs to the file, and others only read access
to the file. The /default means that from now on all the files you create will
be set with this particular protection.  To change one of your own files to
some other protection you can alternatively use:

$set prot topsecret.dat /prot=(system:rwed,group:rwed,world:rwed,owner:rwed)

This would enable all users on the system to access the file 'topsecret.dat'
When specifying the protection, you do not have to list them for each of the
four groups.  You can simply choose only those thatPath: works!merk!alliant!linus!agate!ames!pacbell.com!tandem!UB.com!grafex!steveh

|I think we might all consider ending this thread and taking the time to read
|the P.K. Dick book _Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep?_.  From what I've
|been told it is heads and tails better than the movie, not to mention
|completely different.

Well, any time someone suggests people "read the book" I get a little
mad.  Rarely does it occur that the author of the movie is the author
of the book, thus the two can not be compared.  I'm sure Ridley Scott
can not read to the fullest Phillip K Dick's mind, nor should we want
him to make a movie based completely on the book or Dick's vision.  

I just think movies and books are completely seperate works of art
that can't really be compared.  To me it might be comprable to seeing
a Monet painting and then reading a book about the place that is the
subject of the painting in real life.  Just enjoy the painting for
what it is, and if you want to read the book, that's certainly ok too,
but don't compare 'em - that's my view.

If you have nothing else better to do this weekend than watch CNN,
look for their "FutreWatch" segment...Featured some pretty interesting
stuff including:

--a snippet about the new Blade Runner (PS- look for a scene that
shows Rachael on the streets of LA - I don't think this was in either
release of the movie....)

--a little thing about Sneakers, talking about (if I remember right)
the plausibility of breaking the code (DES, I assume), and ummm, the
possibility of getting government information via computer or
something like that...

--and a very interesting and disturbing little piece about a company
that seeks to put a sort of universal price rate on all
information...I only caught the last portion of this, but it seemed
very disturbing to me...The impression I got from the representative
of the corporation was that someday he hoped to see a sort of "cost
this session" applied to *any* information retrieval via computer...
I hope I see this again so I can confirm this and get more accurate
info...Very scary thought that information will not be a free or
almost-free or as-close-to-free-as-you-can-get in the coming
information age....People are already starting to jack up the price of
everything that you could possibly want to knw....

They've got a file on you. It's on computer. And that computer is connected
to a global network. Who's going to stand up for our civil liberties in the
digital era? Can the anarchic activities of hackers and cyberpunks make them
freedom fighters for the information age?
 
CYBERPUNK
TECHNOLOGY

Cyberspace, the Net, Non-Space, or the Electronic Frontier call it what you
will, but it's out there now, spread across the world like an opulent
immaterial spider's web, growing as each new computer, telephone or fax
machine is plugged in, as satellites close continental divides, hooking
independent phone systems together. It's almost a living entity - the
backbone is the various telephone exchanges, the limbs the copper and fibre-
optic links. Increasingly the world is shifting to this unseen plane. Your
earnings, your purchasing patterns and your poll tax records are processed
there. You may not realise it exists, but it's part of everyday life. As
John Barlow, writer and electronic activist puts it, "Cyberspace is the place
you are when you're on the telephone."

As life moves to this electronic frontier, politicians and corporations are
starting to exert increasing control over the new digital realm, policing
information highways with growing strictness. Before we even realise we're
there, we may find ourselves boxed into a digital ghetto, denied simple
rights of access, whiSubject: Two birds with one can of sauce.

First in response to a /reports section -  
    
    For a long time, there was a section for school reports, and I just 
haven't had a chance to put it back up here, we have a mere dozen or so 
reports, all lacking the pertinant information you wanted, but hey, you have 
to figure if YOU think its good, then thats all that counts. I'll create a 
/tfiles/reports right now for you to start out and I'll dump the other 
reports in there when I get some time.


As for Illegal/illicit material on the works,and what can we get caught for?

     Why don't I quote something for you (From The Department of Criminal 
Justice on Publications - Which I believe extends to text publications) 

This is taken from a Publication Denial Notice (2600Mag, Winter 90-91)

 (a) Publication contains contraband.
 
 (b) Publication contains information regarding the manufacture of 
     explosives, weapons or drugs.
 
 (c) Publication contains material that a reasonable person would construe 
     as written solely for the purpose of communicating information designed 
     to achieve a breakdown of prisons through inmate disruption such as 
     strikes or riots. 
 
 (d) A specific factual determination has been made that the publication is 
     detrimental to prisoners rehabilitation because it would encourage 
     deviate criminal sexual behavior.

                  ...and finally...

  (e) Publication contains material on the setting up and operation or 
      criminal schemes or how to avoid detection of criminal schemes by 
      lawful authorities charged with the responsibility for detecting 
      such illegal activity.

                                                                    _     _
 Now considering our archives, we could very possibly be cited for =_EVERY_= 
item on there, except that we _allegedly_ are allowed to have these items 
and have our rights to have them protected by the First Amendment to

public keys,
and maybe even get them signed. Is anyone else interested in
meeting sometime during the conference for this purpose?

This would at least be slightly more secure than trusting a
posted public key. Of course, whether you believe that it
really is me is a different story. I'm presenting a paper that
I wrote with a co-author that I've never met. So I can't know
that even he is who he claims - or that I am who I claim :-)

Please Email or reply via post. Even if we simply meet to talk
about PGP over a beer, it could be worthwhile.

Come on, don't tell me there isn't a single scuba diver out there who
reads this group?  The mechanism of nitrous oxide is same as for
nitrogen narcosis, commonly called rapture of the deep.  When a diver
goes below about 80 ft, they are in "danger" of getting this effect
(actually I know people who go diving JUST for that effect).  The
nitrous buzz is a function of the amount of nitrogen disolved in your
fatty tissues.  You ongas at an approximately exponetial rate and
offgas at an approximately linear rate.  The nitrogen in your fatty
tissues interferes with neuron transmission.  It is indeed inert to
the body, just hangs around and blocks.  It is NOT a function on
oxygen deprevation; divers are still breathing the same amount of
oxygen at those depths.  When a diver comes up, the nitrogen offgases
safely as it is under a lower pressure (divers breath gases at ambient
pressure which at 100 ft is something like 4 atms; when you come up,
you are under lower pressure so the nitrogen comes out).

So now you can go find another source, go look up nitrogen narcosis in
a scuba book.

Nothing will stop someone if they want it badly enough.  The trick
then is to drive a piece of shit car like I do.   ;-)

And then, of course, there's the perl scripts that I posted to alt.bbs.waffle
last year, and the usenet-file updator that added group descriptions
automagically, so you can get things like

(public) 5:53p (891 left) (?=help) : comp.dcom.modems

comp.dcom.modems (messages from 16475 to 16575)
Data communications hardware and software.

Data communications hardware and software. 
(comp.dcom.modems) 5:54p (890 left) (?=help) : 

I can repost or make the scripts available via mail-server if anyone is
interested.

Here's a version I made from one of the bitmaps that came across the net
a while back.  Freehand version is available upon (limited I hope)
request.

ps. anybody remember the 20page square KGB logo we hung off Wean hall?
pps. I wish the Freehand EPS header was smaller

EDITING FILES
-------------

  An important utility that all VAX hackers should be familiar with is the EDT
text editor. To call it up, use the EDIT DCL command. ie:

$edit [filename]

This will invoke the EDIT/EDT text editor.  The [filename] refers to the file
that you want to edit.  If the file does not exist, it is created at this point.
The EDT editor does not provide a default file type when creating files, so if
you do not specify one, it will leave it as NULL.  It should be noted that there
is more than just the EDT editor, but when you type in EDIT, the default is
/EDT.  Basically it is an editor that you can use to create/modify COM or any
other type of text files.

 After the editor is invoked, it keeps track of everything that you enter in a
JOU file.  In case of lost carrier or some other accident, you can recover what
you had by specifying the /RECOVER qualifier. For example:

$edit/recover memo.dat

This would take the last copy of memo.dat, load it into memory, then process
your last JOU file, updating it to virtually exactly where you were before you
got cut off.  Journaling is automatically defaulted to ON, but can be turned
off with the /NOJOURNAL qualifier.  For a description of what all the qualifiers
are, and what they do, refer to the online HELP manual.

 Ok here is a list of the basic commands you can perform in the EDT editor:


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X   (where X = line number)............show line X only
X:Y (where X,Y = line numbers).........show line X through line Y
A,B,C,D (a,b,c,d = line numbers).......list lines A,B,C,D
X:e ...................................list from X to end
T W ...................................TYPE WHOLE. List ALL of the text lines
S/string1/string2/W....................substitute ALL occurrences of string1
                                       for string2 as they occur from current
                                       line number downwards
"string" ..............................search for first occurrence of string
                                       from current line downwards
T A "string" ..........................type all occurrences of string from
                                       current line downwards
X:Y a "string" ........................search for occurrences of string within
                                       range denoted by X through Y
D X ...................................Delete line X
D X:Y .................................Delete line X through Y, inclusively
I .....................................insert a line
I X ...................................insert from line X
M X:Y to Z ............................move lines X through Y to line Z
RES ...................................resequence line numbers
RES/SEQ:X:10 ..........................resequence from line X in intervals of 10
R X ...................................replace from line X. This deletes the
                                       current line and automatically goes into
                                       insertion mode.
EXIT ..................................leave the editor, and SAVE the current
                                       text.
QUIT ..................................leave the editor and DO NOT SAVE the
                                       current text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sample editing session is shown:

$edit lame.txt

* i

     hi this is just some bullshit text to test out how this EDIT program
     works.  Oh well, easy enough.  bye!

     <hit ctrl-z>

*exit

$type lame.txt

 hi this is just some bullshit text to test out how this EDIT program
 works.  Oh well, easy enough.  bye!

$del lame.txt;*

COMMANDS
--------

In this section i will outline some of the more important commands that you can
issue from the DCL level. This is not meant to be a complete guide. I will
merely point out some of the more important commands and a very brief
description. Proper help can be obtained from the online HELP facility.


NOTE: It should be noted that each of the following commands may have further
----- qualifiers that you can specify. You should check up on these from the
      online help also.


@               -Lets you execute COM script files
ACCOUNTING      -allows you to view and edit system accounting data that keeps
                 track of what system time you have racked up.
ANALYZE         -lets you view the contents of OBJ files in HEX/ASCII format.
ANALYZE/SYSTEM  -Invokes the SDA. VERY VERY USEFUL!! Allows you to view other
                 running processes, their type-ahead buffers etc.
APPEND          -appends the contents of file1 to file2
ATTACH          -allows you to attach yourself to one of your subprocesses
CLOSE           -closes a file that was opened for input/output via OPEN
CONTINUE        -continue a process that you have aborted with control-y
COPY            -copy file1 to file2. You can specify full pathnames, with
                 device and subdirectory. If you want to copy it to your home
                 directory just use sys$login as your 'TO' file.
CREATE          -create a text file of any type. Eg. you want to create a
                 simple COM file or perhaps a letter to another hacker on the
                 system. (you shouldn't be using MAIL to send messages!)
CREATE/DIR      -If you want to create a subdirectory
DELETE          -delete a filename. Remember to specify a version number when
                 you are deleting a file or it wont work.eg. del garbage.com;1
DELETE/INTRUSION_RECORD -gets rid of the failed password attempts
DIFFERENCES     -compares two files and notifies you of their differences
DIRECTORY       -get a directory of the files. Various qualifiers can be chosen
DUMP            -get a hex/ascii file dump
EDIT/EDT        -invokes the VAX EDT interactive text editor
EXAMINE         -view the contents of virtual memory
HELP            -ONLINE HELP MANUAL. REFER TO IT OFTEN!
LINK            -link object files into EXE files that you can run
LOGOUT          -the proper way to terminate a session
PHONE           -Allows you to chat with another user on the system. It is not
                 recommended that you use this, except with fellow hackers.
RENAME          -rename a file or directory
RUN             -lets you execute EXE files
SET CONTROL     -disables/enables interrupts via ctrl-y/ctrl-c
SET DEFAULT     -change directories
SET HOST        -allows you to connect to another mainframe
SET PASSWORD    -change the password of your account
SET PROCESS     -change the characteristics of your process
SET PROMPT      -change the prompt ($)
SET TERMINAL    -change your terminal characteristics
SHOW ACCOUNTING -show the current security/accounting enabled
SHOW AUDIT      -show SECURITY enabled
SHOW DEFAULT    -see your current directory. (Like PWD in UNIX)
SHOW DEVICES    -check out the system setup
SHOW INTRUSION  -view the contents of the breakin database
SHOW LOGICAL    -current logical name assignments
SHOW NETWORK    -lists all the available nodes that you can connect to
SHOW PROCESS    -View your process settings
SHOW PROTECTION -show the default protection you have set
SHOW SYSTEM     -useful to see the running processes
SHOW TERMINAL   -display your terminal characteristics
SHOW USERS      -see who else is logged in.
SPAWN           -spawn a subprocess
STOP            -kill off a subprocess
TYPE            -view a file


  This should give you a general overview of some of the more important
commands that you can use.  It would be impossible for me to list ALL the
commands, and their descriptions, so i suggest that you go through the online
HELP facility and familiarize yourself with the syntax of some these commands.


HACKING

Up to this point i have mainly discussed the basic concepts involved with VMS.
By now you should be familiar and comfortable with the various {false setstrokeadjust}if}if

        Kind of sad. Don't get ripped, Vince, but ... Oh well.

        Your RA hacking thing was mostly plagiarized anyway, and via certain 
measures, RA can be safeguarded quite well.

        And the MATP BBS system that MAcula wanted you to call is indeed a 
butt ugly bbs with shit-ass structure. I would have preferred to have 
Aldebaran take over the BBS, but he's living in a tiny dorm room, so it's 
almost impossible. Too bad, since MAcula is twisting The Eleventh HOur into 
little bits. I streamline it and come back from france to discver he's 
trashed my BBS completely, and KILLED the hard drive. He backed it up, but 
ALL the files are gone. I'm fucking ripped at him. He's competent what has 
he done?  Jesus fuck, im mad.

        I need to reconsider leaving it with him... he ruined it.. he bent 
it out of shape.. and the modem doesn't answer very well or do decent work.. 
fuck! and i cant switch to another bbs, because i'll lose allt he user 
records and bases and its too much of a pain. Anyone know if theres a 
telegard 2.7 to TAG messagebase converter? Yes i run a tg board, so sue me, 
its the first BBS software i ever played with, and the BBS was originally 
aimed at teachers, so i wanted something simple, friendly and easy to use, 
since most arent computer literate. Ah vell. I'll be running a Remote Access 
BBS at Amherst, on campus... if anyone cares. Unfortunately Trog will be 
sysop, and thus be totally foolish and silly, and dream of playing Food 
Fight. Help me god.... But as cosysop and designerof the board, i'll have 
some major say. Fuck. All these thoughts are pissing me off.

        That's what i wanted to say. Thanks... I agree. Porn GIubject of the painting in real life.  Just enjoy the painting for
what it is, and if you want to read the book, that's certainly ok too,
but don't compare 'em - that's my view.

If you have nothing else better to do this weekend than watch CNN,
look for their "FutreWatch" segment...Featured some pretty interesting
stuff including:

--a snippet about the new Blade Runner (PS- look for a scene that
shows Rachael on the streets of LA - I don't think this was in either
release of the movie....)

--a little thing about Sneakers, talking about (if I remember right)
the plausibility of breaking the code (DES, I assume), and ummm, the
possibility of getting government information via computer or
something like that...

--and a very interesting and disturbing little piece about a company
that seeks to put a sort of universal price rate on all
information...I only caught the last portion of this, but it seemed
very disturbing to me...The impression I got from the representative
of the corporation was that someday he hoped to see a sort of "cost
this session" applied to *any* information retrieval via computer...
I hope I see this again so I can confirm this and get more accurate
info...Very scary thought that information will not be a free or
almost-free or as-close-to-free-as-you-can-get in the coming
information age....People are already starting to jack up the price of
everything that you could possibly want to knw....

They've got a file on you. It's on computer. And that computer is connected
to a global network. Who's going to stand up for our civil liberties in the
digital era? Can the anarchic activities of hackers and cyberpunks make them
freedom fighters for the information age?
 
CYBERPUNK
TECHNOLOGY

Cyberspace, the Net, Non-Space, or the Electronic Frontier call it what you
will, but it's out there now, spread across the world like an opulent
immaterial spider's web, growing as each new computer, telephone or fax
machine is plugged in, as satellites close continental divides, hooking
independent phone systems together. It's almost a living entity - the
backbone is the various telephone exchanges, the limbs the copper and fibre-
optic links. Increasingly the world is shifting to this unseen plane. Your
earnings, your purchasing patterns and your poll tax records are processed
there. You may not realise it exists, but it's part of everyday life. As
John Barlow, writer and electronic activist puts it, "Cyberspace is the place
you are when you're on the telephone."

As life moves to this electronic frontier, politicians and corporations are
starting to exert increasing control over the new digital realm, policing
information highways with growing strictness. Before we even realise we're
there, we may find ourselves boxed into a digital ghetto, denied simple
rights of access, whiSubject: Two birds with one can of sauce.

meeting sometime during the conference for this purpose?

This would at least be slightly more secure than trusting a
posted public key. Of course, whether you believe that it
really is me is a different story. I'm presenting a paper that
I wrote with a co-author that I've never met. So I can't know
that even he is who he claims - or that I am who I claim :-)

college... Where'd you get a roommate?

I get em for summer study programs or whatever, but they're not long enough

Come on, don't tell me there isn't a single scuba diver out there who
reads this group?  The mechanism of nitrous oxide is same as for
nitrogen narcosis, commonly called rapture of the deep.  When a diver
goes below about 80 ft, they are in "danger" of getting this effect
(actually I know people who go diving JUST for that effect).  The
nitrous buzz is a function of the amount of nitrogen disolved in your
fatty tissues.  You ongas at an approximately exponetial rate and
offgas at an approximately linear rate.  The nitrogen in your fatty
tissues interferes with neuron transmission.  It is indeed inert to
the body, just hangs around and blocks.  It is NOT a function on
oxygen deprevation; divers are still breathing the same amount of
oxygen at those depths.  When a diver comes up, the nitrogen offgases
safely as it is under a lower pressure (divers breath gases at ambient
pressure which at 100 ft is something like 4 atms; when you come up,
you are under lower pressure so the nitrogen comes out).

So now you can go find another source, go look up nitrogen narcosis in
a scuba book.

Nothing will stop someone if they want it badly enough.  The trick
then is to drive a piece of shit car like I do.   ;-)

And then, of course, there's the perl scripts that I posted to alt.bbs.waffle
last year, and the usenet-file updator that added group descriptions
automagically, so you can get things like

I can repost or make the scripts available via mail-server if anyone is
interested.

EDITING FILES
-------------

  An important utility that all VAX hackers should be familiar with is the EDT
text editor. To call it up, use the EDIT DCL command. ie:

$edit [filename]

This will invoke the EDIT/EDT text editor.  The [filename] refers to the file
that you want to edit.  If the file does not exist, it is created at this point.
The EDT editor does not provide a default file type when creating files, so if
you do not specify one, it will lSubject: Re: bAd bbs

        Yes, but the sicko actually stops using the software after a while 
if its unregistered, unless he can pay for it. Seriously. Creepy, huh? He 
switches BBS software every week it seems, lately. I remember when it was

Discussed and worked out? The guy was killed and toaded.
This is what you call being 'worked out'?  If you have more 
information about this, please contradict me.
So far as I know, it was *not* petty revenge.

Nursery school was kinda fun.

ok, lets see. i get in the mud today and a bunch of people are telling
  me to go read the news groups because some fool (their words, not 
  mine) decided to post some flames about hopper (tng) diku.
ok, well lets see.

1) the prompt -- well if you have bothered to look, the prompt
   offers the options of having the scroll bar or not ( in either
   graphic or ascii) or if you want it to be the standard command
   line prompt (what a lot of diku currently use). so if your
   computer pukes on the idea of the scroll bar, you 
   do not have to use it. and there is also a 'cls' command.
2) using midgaard -- yeah, we tossed around the idea of
   zapping midgaard. well, we decided not to because midgaard
    serves as a good 'ol familiar' to alot of players. if you
    would have bothered to look, there is also another
    town (guernica) that for the time is a little trivial to
    most players ountil the southern continet is done.
3) the say command -- yeah, that space is a toughie. how can
    you judge a mud bassed on having to type a space after 'say'.

4) about use being lazy and not doing anything-- yeah whatever.
    you are right, we have not put anything to the mud. it is all
    generic diku release. NOT. and i think that the commands or
    whatever else we have put in ( a totally re-written crash and
    renting code, fixing the game loop, etc etc) are a little bit
    more than 'bells and whistles'. we take many of the suggestions
    that are given to us by the players, and try to put as 
    many in as possible. we run the game to make others happy
    obviously.
4) about having no creativity -- once again i say 'whatever'.
    yeah, everything on our mud can be seen on other muds.
    uh huh. yeah, nah, we have no areas that are just on our mud.
    we have no things (such as the prompt) that are tng only.
    NOT AGAIN.

by no means do i claim tng to be the best. by no means at all.
   i do not think that any mud can honeslty 100% call itself the
   best.

we try to mke it the best we can. and if you do not like it
   you do not have to play. there is nothing else to say.

i just suggest that people come on and see what it is like b4
   judging it based on someones uninformed judgements.


just a side thought --  i was reading the flame on deth's mud on this
   news group too. i dunno'. i think muds such as deth's, ours and
   some other muds out there are out there and making diku a little
   bit more interesting by creating new and innovative ideas instead
   of just adding the same old stuff. 



reni (co-imp of tng diku, and proud of it)

I also use Desqview and keep a window open with Waffle local
console using "waffle online mikey".  I found out the hard way,
while leaving that window open for months, not to stay in the
mailer will your mail file open.  I've lost and/or buggered up a
few letters when the dial-in/dial-out window was writing to my
mail file.  I don't run share.

I know I need to watch for these sort of conflicts but I was
lazy.  Just a reminder from a lazy bum...

I change them in the static and then rerun waffle. At this point
I have black letters on a green background, which seems pretty
relaxing for the eyes. The status bar is suppose to something
different but is not. As for the windows, I haven't seen any
yet.

The problem that I have is that I use VI as my editor, so when I
create a message I go back to black background with white
letters.

Life is fun...

You didn't say what modem the other end is using. If they're using a
v.32bis modem instead of just v.32, that would mostly explain it, though
the best I've gotten (running Waffle on a 386SX-25 w/a Twincom 14.4DF
modem, FOSSIL unlocked, Waffle 1.65 locked at 38400, talking to a Sun
Sparc 2 using an HST/v.32bis DS) is about 1450cps, with about 1420cps
average. Also, talking to a Supra 14.4 on the same system, I only get
about 1110-1140 cps.

I know of Wafmail but what version works with 1.65 or is the current 
version compatible.
