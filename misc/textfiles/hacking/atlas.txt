Now into the subject of hacking , this
file should give all of you people out
there who are bored and have nothing to
do, something to do... if it doesnt
then i guess it doesnt. Look for issue
2 which is comming soon.

How Bout some international numbers?

Queen Elizabeth loves to talk to
computer hackers and can usually be
reached at 011-441-930-482...

Lodon Radio 44-1-246-8035
Dialing Instructions 44-1-246-8017
Civil Emergencies 44-1-246-8088

A fun thing to do is....Sometimes when
you are calling a friend, board or
whatever you will get a cross line
(usually long distance) where you can
here some other lozers talking, well
its pretty fun to listen into their
conversations...i have heard some VERY
interesting ones...if you are lucky
they will be able to sorta hear you,
and thats when you do stuff like "This
is an emergency interuption, please
hang up imediatly and prepare for an
emegency call" or start cussing them
out or anyhting you want to do!
