Preface:
-------
     ATM's are nothing new, banks have been using them for 

years, and now you see them being used more than ever, and 

are becoming more and more widespread.  This, of course, 

just opens up more ways to make money, and I am again 

bringing you another safe and proven technique of improving 

your cash flow.
 
Banks:
-----
     As mentioned, almost all banks nowadays have ATM 

machines.

Grab the local phone book and start calling banks.  What you 

want to know is "What is the most I can take out of an ATM 

machine right after I deposit a check?"  Most banks range 

anywhere from $50 to $1000.  This is for when you make a 

deposit via the ATM, and then right away make a withdraw 

against the funds on the check, even though the check hasn't 

been verified.  I'm sure you can see what's coming.
 
Account:
-------
     Open a savings account at the bank that offers the 

highest amount of ATM withdraw.  Use a fake name (of course) 

and apply for the ATM card too.  You might even tell them 

that you need the ATM card because you work odd hours, so it 

is difficult for you to get to the banks when they are open.
 
Deposit:
-------
     Soon you will get your ATM card in the mail, and it 

should be sent to your mailing address that would be a lot 

like a drop for carding.  You should be able to figure out 

how to do that.  Take your ATM card and go to the banks ATM 

machine.  Select DEPOSIT  and when it asks for amout, type 

in $999.00.  DO NOT deposit an amount OVER $1000!  This is 

important because then the check will have to wait for bank 

clearance, which means that you'll be screwed.

When it's time to insert the deposit into the slot on the 

ATM, insert an empty envelope.  For all the ATM knows, this 

was just a check for $999.00, and now places your account 

ledger at $999.00.  Now you are free to withdraw up to the 

full $1000 that you are allowed.  Since you never really put 

in any money, this is all free money coming out!
 
 
I've done this myself and got $950 out of a machine.  It was 

a HUGE stack of twenties!  Just be on the watch for cameras!
 
Have fun.
