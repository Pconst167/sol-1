Part I: Introduction 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Ok, so it's time to write an introductory phile for all those people
out there who have always wanted to do stuff like they see in the movies but
don't know how.  Well, almost like you see in the movies.  This file isn't
going to teach you how to launch ICBM's at Russia or anything, but it will
get you to become familiar with some hack/phreak (h/p) terms that are
commonly used.  I've tried writting this before but I didn't know where to
start.  H/P texts get spread around the world so quickly, that if I wrote a
hack/phreak text on how to get started in the St. Catharines/Niagara area,
people in Europe won't have a clue as to what the hell I was talking about.
But screw it, the way I see things it's better to get people started here
then over there.  At least I can see the effects of this file if it's for
local people.

	Alot of you may already have knowledge about alot of the systems I'm
going to talk about (VAX, Unix, Primos, etc..) from your university
experiences (alot of universities use VAX's in particular, and you may have
already used the Unix operating system on those good old ICON's in high
school).  If you don't have any previous experience with these systems,
don't panic, this file should explain most of what you need to know on
getting started.  You may be asking yourself "Why is he writting this file
anyways?".  Well, for one, because the phreak community in Niagara SUCKS.
As far as I know, my BBS is the only one supporting h/p areas that are
active.  Two, it seems I'm the only one calling long distance because I'm
the only one that CAN (for free).  With more people calling for free, the
more of the world will be brought to Niagara (instead of people like myself
going to all continents chasing after things).  Also, I'll be
concentrating on the Datapac network, because it's the biggest Canadian
network around and it has local dialups all across the country.  Future
releases will get more into detail about other networks such as Tymnet,
Telenet, ItaPAC, etc..


 
Part II: Rules, Code of Ethics, Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Before I start talking about anything, I'd like to state some of the
rules to follow, some of the phreak's codes of ethics, and some warnings on
what to do and what NOT to do:

 1 - Always share information.  A "fone phreak" is someone who shares what
     he finds, with other people, that's the whole idea.  There's strength
     in numbers and there's a hellova lot more chance on cracking a system
     that 200 people know about, then cracking a system that one person has
     found but chooses to keep it a secret.

 2 - Don't destroy information.  This is a *must follow* rule.  If you have
     broken into a computer for some company and can't find anything of
     interest, don't start formatting hard drives and screwing up the system.
     The chance of getting caught could double or triple as soon as you do
     this (ESPECIALLY if you are calling that system through a network,
     there's more chance that someone may be watching what you're doing).
     Of course it's okay to delete any files that may show that you where IN
     the system (log files, incorrect password files, etc..) but don't 
     kill anything for no reason.

 3 - Help others.  You'll find most people in the phreak community will be
     willing to help you and answer questions as long as you're polite.  
     You WILL do most of your learning by yourself but there will also be
     times when you've got something you have NO CLUE about, and have to ask
     someone who does.  So once YOU are experienced and someone has a
     question, answer it no matter how basic the question may seem.  
     Remember, everyone was a beginner sometime.

 4 - Don't go too far into things you don't know about.  There are certain
     things out there that only the most experience hackers should screw
     with (eg: C.B.I., Cosmos, some 1-800 services, etc..).  

 5 - Don't show off by telling people what you've done.  Sure it's okay
     to talk to other phreaks about your doings, but if you have someone
     on a board who you've known for awhile, but doesn't seem to be into the
     h/p scene, don't start babbling to him about all the stuff you've
     hacked.  I've heard a FEW stories about people bragging to other people
     that they don't really know, and have arrived in a pile of dung for it.
     Only talk about hack/phreak stuff on hack/phreak BBS's.


	Well those are most of the things you should follow, sure there's
lots of other rules I could have put up but those are the main ones.  I hope
they help.  I know there'll always be that ONE person that doesn't share his
info, or that ONE person that will want to destroy every system he finds,
but I hope the majority will be follow those rules.

	Oh yah, before I go on, you're probably wondering "What the hell's
the difference between a hacker and a phreak".  Well, a hacker is basically
someone who is interested in information, someone who wants to get into
systems to LEARN from them.  A phreak is someone who wants to use that
knowledge to his advantage (free phone calls, use of pay services, etc..).
A lot of hackers stay to their own area, hacking local systems, whereas a lot
of phreaks don't even own computers!  All you need to phreak is a touchtone
phone (essentially).  Of course, a lot of phreaks use their knowledge to
HACK on other systems that they can get to calling long distance, and alot of
hackers get into phreaking for the same reason.  I guess the main difference
is that hackers want to learn information, and phreaks are more interested
in sharing it.  A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.


Part III: Definitions of H/P Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Ok, not all of these following terms are used JUST in the h/p
community but you should know what they mean.  You could be writing down
stuff from a VMB and not know what the hell you're writing down.  Knowing
the terminology is important.  There's literally HUNDREDS of things I
could list here, but I'll stick to the stuff you need to know... If you
want a full list of terminology call the ICE HQ BBS (416-934-4055) and get
it there.


800 Services - there are MANY types of 800 services (eg: PBX's (Private
     Branch eXchanges), 950's, etc..) that allow you to call for free.
     PBX's are the most popular service and are used by big companies.  
     Ok, a company wants it's employees to be able to make long distance 
     phone calls (for business purposes only of course) so that the calls 
     are billed directly to the company.  The employee would call up the 
     800 number, enter a code, and then would be switched over to another 
     line and would hear a dial tone.  From here he enters the long distance
     number he wants to call.  What hackers/phreaks do find these services,
     hack out the codes, and use them for themselves.  Most 800 services are
     limited to calling within North America but I HAVE seen a few that
     allow overseas calls.  When you call long distance using an 800 service,
     it just as a standard connection so uploading and downloading on BBS's
     is possible (unlike when calling using PADs - more on this below).  
     The prob with these services is that once a code is hacked out, it's
     spread over VMBs to hundreds  of other hackers, and the codes don't 
     last long.

Amex - American Express credit card

CC - Calling Card.  Calling Cards are used widespread in Europe (especially
     AT&T's) and North America (usually MCI's - safer to use here.).  The
     main calling cards that are used by phreaks are AT&T's (also referred 
     to as ATTs), MCI, Sprint, and even Bell once in awhile.  MCI's are 
     safe to use, I've used a number of them racking up hundreds of dollars 
     in unpaid long distance calls and haven't been bothered by anyone.  
     The problem with using calling cards to call for free is that they 
     don't last long.  If you get a calling card over a VMB then chances 
     are their's a few THOUSAND other phreaks using that same card to call 
     all over the world within a few hours.  It's unusual for a calling 
     card to last more than a day or two.

CC - Credit Card.  Yes, the same abbreviation is used for calling cards as
     credit card's.  The only thing credit cards are good for basically is
     calling up porno lines.  They're useless without all the info.  Most
     of the time when you get a credit card it will just be the card
     number (14-16 digit) and the expiry date (month and year eg: 10/93
     for Oct. 1993).  If by some chance you get a credit card that has
     ALL the info (holder's name, SIN #, age, date of birth, issuing
     bank, etc...) you've got yourself a hot item.  If the card is new
     (virgin - nobody else knows about it) you can do a number of things.
     1: you can call up pay services and register with them (eg:
     CompuServe, GEnie, BIX, etc) or 2: you can do a mail order and et
     yourself that 700 meg hard drive you've always wanted.  There are
     a couple of drawbacks to do this though.  You have to know how much
     money the holder has left to spend on the card (yes, you can also
     find this out...) and you have to have an empty house to have it
     mailed to (or do what some people I know have done - order it
     straight to your house).  Anyways... I don't think I have to tell
     you the advantages of having someone else's credit card information.
     If you've got one then use your imagination.  And whatever you do,
     stay quiet about it.  Credit card fraud is a bitchin offence.  Major
     cc's that are frequently ripped of are American Express, VISA, and
     MasterCard.

Codes - Well it's pretty self-explanitory but a code can be anything from
    a way to call long distance for free, to a number of a virgin VMB
    system, to a backdoor to a porno chat line, to a login to a VAX system.
    Codes are basically anything that will let you use a pay service (of 
    any kind) for free, or something that will get you into somewhere
    you're not supposed to be.

PAD - Packet Assembler/Disassembler.  That's one name, it's also referred
    to by some as a Public Access Device.  All it is, is a program that is
    tied into a network (eg: X.25) and it allows you to call any other 
    system in the world that is also connected to the X.25 network via
    it's network user address (NUA).  Advantages of using a PAD to call
    systems is that you get a crystal clear connection - no line noise.
    The disadvantage, is since what you type is put into a packet (usually
    128 or 256 bytes - but this can be changed), there is a DELAY called
    "PAD delay".  Eg: you get to prompt that says "Hit any Key to Continue"
    so you hit the return key.  Text would not continue to come out from
    the other end for a few seconds after that.  Also, when you're typing
    in large amounts of text as in messages, the text you enter will appear
    on your screen in chunks at a time.  The major disadvantage of calling
    through PADs is that upload/downloading isn't possible.  There ARE u/d
    protocals designed to take pad delay into account but none for 
    microcomputers yet (or none that I know of).  Some people claim to have
    gotten (I know, bad grammer) Zmodem to work when calling through a PAD
    but I haven't myself.

NUI - Network User Identification.  This is similar to an NUA but the 
    major difference is that it's used by only one person and not an 
    entire company.  Eg: an employee connects to Datapac and enters his
    NUI (usually a 6-digit #) and from there he can call any system in
    the world via X.25 network.  If his company is in Toronto Canada and
    he's off on business in France, he can hook up to his companies 
    system by using his NUI to call.  Datapac NUI's are scarce and chances
    are you won't be using one that often.

NUA - Network User Address.  These are numbers consisting of a variable
    number of digits that are used by the X.25 network to connect you to
    other systems.  An NUA is kind of like a phone number.  Eg: the NUA 
    for an international chat line in France called QSD is 208057040540.
    So to connect to QSD I'd get to a PAD, enter the calling command 
    (usually c1) then the NUA of the system I want to connect to.  So at 
    the PAD prompt (I'll use the PADs on Primos computers called "NetLink"
    as an example) I'd enter c1208057040540 [return] and in seconds it 
    would say something like PAD - Call connected to 208057040540 and I'd
    be on QSD.  There are thousands of NUAs for all types of systems 
    ranging from chat lines, to university VAX's, to government mainframes,
    to small company computers, to online libraries.  

OD - OutDial.  This is a phone line that you connect to via it's NUA
    and from there it switches you to an average telephone line from
    which you can call out using ordinary telephone numbers.  Most 
    major urban areas have an outdial and all outdials are connected to
    by it's NUA.  An example for Milwaukee Wisconsin, USA is
    311041400020 which has a 2400 baud modem attached to it (some outdials
    even have 9600 modems attached to them.  So if I wanted to call Tone
    Town BBS in Milwaukee Wisconsin which has a phone number of
    (414)781-3218 I'd connect to my PAD, then connect to the Milwaukee 
    outdial, and from there I'd type ATZ [return] (to reset the modem at 
    the outdial), then ATDT7813218 [return] and that would make a local 
    call from the outdial to the BBS.  Lists of outdials and the areas
    they're for are availible on most half-decent hack/phreak BBS's.  Of
    course the only way to get to an outdial is through a PAD and that
    will give you PAD delay, but hey, it's a crystal clear connection and
    it's free.  Outdials (normal ones) only allow you to make local calls
    from them although SOME outdials (Global Outdials - GOD's) allow you
    to make calls anywhere.  I'd say only about 1 in 20 outdials are
    GOD's.  There's no way to tell the difference, only to try to call
    long distance from the outdial and see for yourself.  Oh yah, if you
    want a menu when you're connected to an outdial, enter "%" and hit
    return.  You'll get a "READY" prompt then type "?" and hit return for
    a menu.

VMB - Voice Mail Box.  These are neat little devices used by company 
    employees to recieve voice mail.  Essentially what they are is a
    1-800 answering machine.  It allows the owner to be away on business
    and still check for any messages by entering a secret "passcode". When
    this passcode is entered the owner can listen to his messages, delete
    them, change his greet or do a number of other things.  A standard
    voice mail system could have up to a thousand or more mail boxes on it.
    So what's the use of 'em?  When you call a VMB system a recorded message
    will come on asking you to enter the voice mailbox number (usually a 3
    or 4 digit number) using your average touchtone phone.  You enter the
    mailbox number of the person you're trying to reach and they're recorded
    message (called the "greet") will be played.  How they're used?  Well
    phreaks call up these VMB services and hack out the passcodes of other
    people's mailboxes and use it for themselves.  This allows phreaks
    from all over the country to call up, listen to the greet (which is 
    usually filled with codes), and leave some codes (if the person has
    any) after the beep.  EG: I call up Digital Assassin's voice mailbox
    at 1-800-268-6683 (just an example), enter 4251 at the recording (an
    example of what his mailbox # would be) and his pre-recorded message
    would come on listing a bunch of codes to different services, bbs
    numbers to call, etc..  then at the beep, if I didn't have any codes
    I could advertise my favorite bbs eg: "Hi, this is Liquid Jesus.  Call
    Psychiatric CyberHell BBS at 416-934-4055.  Later" and hang up.  If
    Digital Assassin was cool he'd put this in his next greet.  Most
    greets are updated every day or second day.  VMB's are the best way
    to trade information quickly and the best way to get new codes.


Ok, so you still don't know how to call long distance for free right? 
Well from the above mentioned terms, there's 2 different ways:

1 - using 800 services
2 - using a PAD

eg. for 800 service:
 
I type AT&C <cr> to set my modem's carrier detect ON.
I type ATXD (NOT hitting return yet)
I pick up my touch tone and enter the 800 service (eg: 1-800-123-4567)
at the tone I enter the code, and then I recieve another dialtone.
I enter 1-416-934-4055 (the number of the BBS I'm calling).
When I hear the carrier I hit return (which sends the ATXD to the modem
telling it to connect) and hang up my voice phone and WALLA!  I'm
connected.

eg. for a PAD  (little more complicated...)

I call up my local Datapac dialup (eg: 687-1115 - a 2400bps dialup)
I enter ".." <cr>    (two periods and return to tell Dpac I'm there)
I enter the datapac address of the system I want to connect to eg:20500015
plus <cr> and now I'm connected to that system.  I now enter the username
and password or whatever is needed to enter the system.  Once in, I get to
the PAD on that system, at the pad I enter the NUA of the OutDial that I
want to connect to.  Once connected to the outdial I enter ATZ <cr> then
ATDT<number> <cr> and that will connect me.  So basically it's connecting
to Datapac -> system -> pad -> outdial -> BBS

The only way to use either is for someone to tell you EXACTLY how because
each system is different.  I don't have any working PADs right now so I
can't give you a working example.

Ok, enough of that.


PART IV: Hacking Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	The three computer systems I'm going to talk about are Unix, VAX,
and Prime.  Unix's are easy to use, VAX's have very powerful commands, and
Primes... well Primes are relatively SHIT but have *excellent* PAD
software (called "NetLink") and easy to use commands.  Jeez, some Prime
systems will even let you boost your own access... (duhh..) but most don't
contain any good info on them.  Each have an easy way to identify them.
Unix systems will ask for a "Login:" and "Password:" and will give you
unlimited tries and will never kick you off, although they will NOT tell 
you if you've entered a wrong login or password but will just tell you 
that ONE of them didn't work (eg: "Invalid login or password").  VAX 
systems ask for a "Username:" and "Password:" and will allow only 3
invalid tries before kicking you off.  Once in, VAX's will give you a "$"
for a prompt.  Prime systems will display a line as soon as you connect
something like:

PRIMENET 22.0.3 VOID

The "Primenet" tells you it's a Prime system, the 22.0.3 is the revision
of PRIMOS the system is running under (it's operation system ie PrimOS)
and the "VOID" is the system nodename upon connect.  It will not give you
a "login" prompt but you can either enter "login" and hit return to get 
one or just simply type "login <username>" and it will then give you the
"Password:" prompt.  Prime systems only give one chance to connect before
they kick you off.  Prime systems give an "OK," as a prompt.  Now, going 
into more detail on Unix's, Vax's, and Primes...


                                 VAX's:
                                 ------

     The VAX acronym is derived from Virtual Address eXtension.  The VAX
computer is designed to use memory addresses beyond the hardware's actual
limits, enabling it to handle programs that are too large to fit into 
physical memory.  The VAX computer system is a member of the Digital 
Equipment Corporation (DEC) computer family.  Currently the VAX series 
includes models spanning the desktop VAX station to mainframe class 
multi-CPU VAX processors.  These vary from the superminis, like MicroVAX, 
to the older, moderate sized 11/7XX series, to the newer 6000 series. 
These computer systems commonly use an operating system known as VMS.

    The VMS acronym is for Virtual Memory System.  The operands of VMS
are very similar to other operating systems.  Back in the days of 
stand-alone computer systems, DEC had the idea for streamlining the 
operation of their computers for business and engineering.  It conceived
VMS as a way of allowing the basic computer management to be done by a user
familiar with any of the multiple systems it made.

How to get into a VAX by default login/passwords:
-------------------------------------------------

	When DEC designed the VAX they put in several default accounts to
test them out.  These accounts have passwords which don't change from 
system to system.  The system manager should have removed them before the
system was put online but it is not done all the time.  Here are several
defaults for VAX systems:

  Username      Password
  ------------  -----------------
  DECNET        DECNET               -- The accounts listed with
* SYSTEST       UETP                    asterisks "*" next to them are
                SYSTEST                 very powerful accounts.  Defaults
  SYSTEM        SYSTEM                  that have worked for me in the
  DEFAULT       DEFAULT                 past are OPERATOR and SYSTEM. 
* FIELD         FIELD
  OPERATIONS    OPERATIONS
  OPERATOR      OPERATOR
* SUPPORT       SUPPORT

OK, so this basically tells you how to recognize when you've connected to
a VAX and possible ways to get in.  I'm not going to get into detail about
commands but if you DO manage to get into a VAX system, they give
unlimited descriptions of the commands availible.  Just hit HELP at the
prompt and you can get a full description of anything.  The online HELP
will explain it better than I can...


                                 PRIME's
                                 -------
[Some of the following information extracted from "Introduction to the
 PRIMOS Operation System" by the VOID Hackers..]

One thing about Primes is that they're generally ignored by the average
hacker because of the lack of information on them and unfamiliarity, but
PRIMOS is a very user-friendly operating system.  Main Prime owners these
days are corporations and governments.  Different models of Primes are the
Prime 250's (ancient) and 750's (also ancient but still in use), the Prime
4150's (a mid-range system) and the huge Prime 9550's (high-end mini's). 
Also in the high-end spectrum is the Prime MCXL's (super-mini's) and Prime
workstation clusters.  As there are many models, there are just as many
revisions of PRIMOS (the Prime operating system) they run on.  About all
you'll see today are Rev. 20.xx, 21.xx, 22.xx or 23.xx but some foreign
packet-switching networks (PSN's) are still running revisions 17.xx,
18.xx, and 19.xx. (such as Brazil's Interdata or Renpac networks).  Here
are a list of default logins/passwords for PRIME systems:

Anyways.. if you do get a successful login and password it will return
something like this (I'll call the username "PRIMEUSER" as an example):

        PRIMEUSER (user 87) logged in Sunday, 22 Jan 89 16:15:40.
        Welcome to PRIMOS version 21.0.3
        Copyright (c) 1988, Prime Computer, Inc.
        Serial #<serial_number> (company_name)
        Last login Wednesday, 18 Jan 89 23:37:48.

'serial_number' and 'company_name' will be replaced by the actual serial number
and company name of the company that owns the Prime computer site.

Once you're in PRIMOS will give you one of two prompts: "OK," or "ER!". 
Both are the same, the later just means the previous command you entered
had an error (ie: invalid command).

Ok, to get a list of commands and descriptions type "HELP" for a list of
commands and " <Command Name> HELP " or " HELP <command Name> " for
additional information on that command.


UNIX:
-----

There's too much information on the Unix system for me to decide where to
begin so I'll just state the basics.  I'll give you a big file that
explains Unix's inside-out upon request.  Ok, Unix systems as stated
before are identified with the "login:" and "password:" prompts.  Unix's
will give unlimited attempts to get a correct login/password combination.
Powerful default logins are "root, daemon, sysadm, sysadmin, spool" with
the "root" login being the most powerful of all.


PART V: DATAPAC, FINDING SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Ok, so you wanna get out there and get started right?  Ok, well if
you live in the St. Catharines/Niagara area of Ontario what you do is call
up your local Datapac dialup (eg: 687-1104, 687-1115) and once you're
connected you must enter 2 periods and hit return ".. <cr>" and you'll get
something like

DATAPAC: 3720 1350

or something... The first thing you need to know about Datapac is that the
addresses of the systems connected to it are 8 digits long (when in
standard format... some are up to 20 digits long).  Most have the first
digit higher than "1" and the forth digit a "0".  The good thing about
Datapac is that it has an extensive online help system.  To reach this
enter the address "92100086" and hit return.  It will give a menu and you
can go from there are read up about Datapac as much as you want.

Scanning Datapac:

Ok, the best way to find other systems hooked up with datapac is to scan
for them.  First, decide on what numbers you're going to scan.  Eg: if you
wanted to scan from say 71500000 up, set a macro key to "715000" and enter
the macro+01 then macro+02 then macro+03 etc. etc...  if there's nothing
at that address you'll recieve a "DATAPAC - Invalid Address" response. 
One thing to keep in mind: after every 8 invalid addresses you enter IN A
ROW, Datapac will hang up on you.  Therefore, you MUST enter an address
that connects to a system every 8 unsuccessful tries.  An example is a
system at "20800315" which will connect you to a system and immediately
kick you back to Datapack.  Enter this address after every 8 invalid 
addresses when scanning.  This will keep you from being kicked off for
invalid attempts.  Eg: If I was scanning 205000xx I'd enter 205000 in a
macro, enter macro+00, macro+01, macro+02, etc.. and if I got to macro+07
(which would be 20500007) I'd enter the other macro (20800315) and that
would keep me from being kicked of datapac.  Then I could keep scanning...
  
You'll come across alot of weird systems when scanning Dpac.  Most will be
either Unix, Prime, or VAX systems but you'll get alot that say stuff like
"Service=" or "Password>" or just really screwed up stuff.  If you ever
get to a Unix (which gives you unlimited tries to login) and want to get
back to Datapac enter 2 CTRL-D's and hit return at the "Login:" prompt.

UNRESPONSIVE SYSTEMS:

Some systems will connect and be unresponsive.  When this happens try
sending a hard break (or a bunch of them) or try the CTRL-<key> keys going
through the alphabet.  If you're convinced you've tried everything and the
system still isn't responding just hangup and call Datapac back up.

Most of the responses you get while scanning will be 

DATAPAC - Invalid Address

but once in awhile you'll get something like

DATAPAC - Remote Directive

or

DATAPAC - Incompatible Destination

or something else... Don't worry about writing down these addresses
because they're useless.  The only one (besides DATAPAC - Call Connected
of course) to keep track of is "DATAPAC - Collect Call Refused".  This
means that the system at the address you entered will not pay for the
connection.  It is still possible to reach that system by using a PAD so
don't throw those addresses away.

If you've done alot of scanning and still can't find anything of interest
here's a few things you can check out:

All of those were taken from the I.C.E. Datapac Address List (over 200
systems listed... check it out - availible on my BBS - ICE HQ)

Ok.. I've talked a little more than I planned to but there's still alot
more I want to tell you about.  This is just the first version of this
handbook so whatever you want to know about, call my BBS and leave me
feedback and I'll make SURE your question is answered in the next release
no matter how small it may be.  If you or someone you know would like to be
a guest writer, let me know and tell me what you're gonna talk about, or
just send in a text file and I'll look at it and put it in the next
release.

This first release is just to open people's eyes to the h/p society and
the questions can flow from here.  When I know what people want to know
about (specifically.. it's very hard to explain hack/phreaking in general)
I'll know what to put in the next release.  There are of course, some
things you have to be familiar with before I can start going into detail
about them.

Please call my BBS and leave any comments or suggestions about this so I
can make the next release better.  This is a sort of "alpha" release...
