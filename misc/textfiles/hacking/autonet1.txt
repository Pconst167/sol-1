                             HOW TO CONNECT TO AUTONET


          To establish a connection to Autonet,  simply  follow  the  steps
          listed below.

           1. Dial your local access number and  wait  for  a  high-pitched
              tone.
              NOTE: If you are using a direct-connect terminal, proceed  to
              Step 3.

           2. Switch data set to DATA, or place the telephone receiver fir-
              mly in the acoustic coupler, orienting the cord as indicated.

           3. Press the RETURN key two times.

           4. Autonet will respond with:

                      Autonet Line xxxxxxxxxx
                      Command:

           5. Type one or more of the connection dialog commands  described
              on  the  following pages. The appropriate C or ID command and
              corresponding name or number will be provided to you when you
              become  an  Autonet user. The H and T commands may be used in
              conjunction with either of these.


                                   SAMPLE SESSION

                          [ <CR><CR> ]

                          Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command: [ C NAME;H;T D1 ]

              Autonet will respond to this dialog by:

                  (1) setting  the  correct  parameters  for  your terminal
                      model

                  (2) typing out the connection dialog HELP file

                  (3) connecting you to your destination and  issuing  this
                      message:

                      CALL CONNECTED


                   AUTONET CONNECTION DIALOG COMMAND SUMMARY


          COMMAND FORMAT              FUNCTION              EXAMPLE

          C nnnnnnnnnn   Requests a connection to a host    C 5555
                         whose address is nnnnnnnnnn.   

          C cccccccccc   Requests a connection to a host    C NAME
                         whose name is cccccccccc.      

          H              Prints this list of commands.      H

          ID xxxxxxxxx   Identifies the user and re-        ID 1234-567
                         quests a  connection  to  the
                         host  associated  with  the    
                         user's identity code xxxxxxxxx.

          T cn           Identifies a terminal model by     T D1
                         the terminal identity code cn.
                         See the TERMINAL option of AID.

             * Use a space to separate a command name and its parameter.

                 ** Use a semicolon (;) to separate commands which
                               occupy the same line.



              AUTONET CONNECTION DIALOG COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS

                In all examples, information the user types is shown
                             in square brackets ([ ]).


                                    The C Command


          PURPOSE         The  C  command  requests  a connection to a sub-
                          scribing host computer. The particular  host  can
                          be  specified by a numerical address, or, through
                          special arrangements, by an alphabetic name.  The
                          terminal  session  is  charged to the subscribing
                          host.


          GENERAL FORM    C nnnnnnnnnn

                          Where:

                          nnnnn~nnnnn  is  the  numeric  address assigned by
                          Autonet to the host computer.

                          or

                          C cccccccccc

                          Where:

                          cccccccccc is the alphabetic name chosen  by  the
                         subscriber for the host computer.


          EXAMPLE         Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command:[ C 5555 ]

                          CALL CONNECTED

                          (Proceed with host log-on procedure.)


          NOTES           If no host exists at the given address or by  the
                          given name, the user will receive the message:

                                  ?**No such host.

                          If the subscribing host will not accept the char-
                          ges, the user will receive the message:

                                ?**User ID required.



                                   The ID Command


          PURPOSE         The ID command identifies the user and requests a
                          connection  to  the  host  associated  with  that
                          user's  identification  code.  The  network  will
                          require the user to enter a valid password before
                          completing the connection. The  terminal  session
                          is charged to the user.


          GENERAL FORM    ID xxxxxxxxx

                          Where:

                          xxxxxxxxx is an alphanumeric user  identification
                          code.

          EXAMPLE         Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command:[ ID 1234-567 ]
                          XXXXXXPassword

                          CALL CONNECTED

                          (Proceed with host log-on procedure.)


          NOTES           To  connect  to  a  destination  other  than  the
                          default host, use the C  command  in  conjunction
                          with the ID command.


          EXAMPLE         Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command:[ ID 2345-12;C 5555 ]
                          XXXXXXPassword

                          CALL CONNECTED

                          Proceed with the host log-on procedure.


                                    The H Command


          PURPOSE         The H command prints a connection dialog  command
                          summary  as  a  helpful reminder for users. The H
                          command may be used in conjuction with other com-
                          mands,  or  it  may  be  used as a single command
                          PRIOR to issuing the C or  the  ID  commands.  If
                          used  individually,  the  network will follow the
                          summary display with a prompt  for  another  com-
                          mand.


          GENERAL FORM    H

          EXAMPLE         Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command:[ H ]
                          .
                          .
                          .

                          Autonet displays Command Summary.
                          .
                          .
                          .

                          Command:


          EXAMPLE         Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command:[ H;C 5555 ]

                          Autonet displays Command Summary.

                          CALL CONNECTED

                          (Proceed with host system log-on procedures.)


                                    The T Command


          PURPOSE         The T  command  identifies  the  use\}r's  terminal
                          model so that the network can set certain operat-
                          ing parameters to optimize the terminal's charac-
                          teristics.  The  T command may be used in conjuc-
                          tion with other commands, or it may be used as  a
                          single  command  PRIOR to issuing the C or the ID
                          commands. If used individually, the network  will
                          establish  the correct parameters and will prompt
                          for another command.


          GENERAL FORM    T cn

                          Where:

                          cn  is the alphanumeric code which identifies the
                          terminal model.

          EXAMPLE         Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command:[ T D1 ]

                          (Autonet  establishes optimal parameters for ter-
                          minal model.)

                          Command:


          EXAMPLE         Autonet Line 3130157042
                          Command:[ T D1;C 5555 ]

                          Autonet  sets  optimal  parameters  for  terminal
                          model and requests a connection to host 5555.


          NOTES           A list of codes for commonly used terminal models
                          appears in "HOW TO USE AUTONET" and under the op-
                          tion TERMINAL in  Autonet's  on-line  information
                          directory,   AID.   Contact  your  Autonet  Sales
