     Hacking is all about information.  To become a hacker you must learn everything you know
on your own or by listening to other hackers.  Schools and what they call "education" has little
to do with learning.  So this file is here to show you some truly productive things to do at 
school:

     Most middle and high schools use Macintosh computers for 2 reasons.  They're easier to use
and harder to fuck up.  Almost all school computers use some sort of security program.  Here I
will discuss how to get around two popular security programs: FoolProof and At Ease.  You can
probably use these methods on other programs as well.

  - FoolProof:  FoolProof is a program that locks up parts of the computer.  It is run thru the
extention FoolProof INIT whenever the computer is started up.  The first thing to try is to
hold SHIFT during startup to turn the extentions off.  Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it
doesn't.  If this does work, try to copy FoolProof onto a disk to use as an unlock disk if you
ever come to a computer where the extentions off method doesn't work.  If shift doesn't work
there is a few other things you can do.  If you just want to get into a locked folder just do a
FIND and search for a file you know is inside.  Example: You want to get into the System folder.
Go to FIND and search for FINDER, a file you know is inside System Folder.  It will bring you to
the Finder, inside the System Folder.  From there you can use anything else inside.  Sometimes
every single file inside the System Folder will also be locked and then this doesn't work.  If all
else fails you need to get an unlock disk.  Here is how to make and use one:

  1) Go to an old computer such as a Mac Classic and hold shift during start-up.
  2) FoolProof should be turned off along with the extentions.
  3) Copy FoolProof onto a disk
  4) Take the disk to a locked computer
  5) Run FoolProof off the disk
  6) It'll display some message asking you if you want to shut down to other version of
         FoolProof running.  Click YES.
  
If you can't get to a computer where the extentions off method works tell a nice teacher that you
need to move some files and you need FoolProof to be off.  He should turn it off and when he
isn't looking you can copy FoolProof to a disk.

  - At Ease: At ease is a different Operating System than the Mac OS and it won't let you out
unless you have the password.  If you have a nack for guessing passwords try that.  Do this: hold
COMMAND and hit the POWER key.  You should get a box with a little > prompt.  Type G FINDER to
get back to the finder.  If this doesn't work run as many applications as you can to clog up
memory.  You should soon get a message saying "Not enough memory to run this application, would
you like to close At Ease?"  Click yes (no, really?).  


     Things to do to a computer once its unlocked:
  - Change the colors:  Go into Control Panel and change the colors of everything.  It should
annoy sysadmins a bit.

  - Change the font:  Change the main font to Zaft Dingbats or Symbol so no one can read the
titles to things.  
 
  - Change icons:  Change the names and pictures of a bunch of icons

  - Put messages in StartUp items:  Type a message and put it into the Startup Items menu.

  - Shut down on StartUp:  Go to Apple Menu Items and get the Shut Down item.  Put it into the
StartUp itmes folder.  Gee, I wonder what that would do?  

  - Relock:  If you can get a version of FoolProof with no password assigned put it into use
with a different password so teachers will be locked out of their comptuers.

   There are bajillions of other cool tricks you could do, so just play around.  Remember:
Anyone can delete a file.  There's no challenge in that, its just vandalism.  It is much better
to make a kewl alteration to something then to delete it.  


     Fun stuff to do to Netscape:  

  - Change the home page location to either, your own page or a really nasty site.

  - Change the font to Zaft Dingbats or Symbol

  - Select "Always use my colors" on the Color prefs and change the backgroud, foreground and 
links to white.  It'll be more than slightly anoying.

    Prank E-Mailing:

  Change the Identity settings to someone else and send nasty E-Mail messages to all your favorite
teachers.  Or if you really hate a teacher you can SPAM them like this:

   1) First send as many messages as you can to the target with large attachments.
   2) Go on the internet and sign the target up for a million mailing lists.  A great place with
tons of mailing lists to sign her/him up for can me found at the "List of Entemology Resources
on the Web -- complete".  Just type "insects" at infoseek.
   3) Go into a weird newsgroup and type a bunch of messages asking people to mail you back as
the targets adress.

     The Administration Shared Disk:

  This is the server disk in which all the information about Grades, Discipline and a bunch of 
other crap is stored.  Sometimes you can find a link to it on a student computer by seraching for
theses words "admin","shared disk", and the name of your school district.  If you get to it you
will probably need a User Name and password.  Type the name of one of the Sysadmins at the school
in a bunch of formats like "last, first intial", "last, first", "first last" and so on.  Then
try to guess a password.  Use things like the persons kids names, wife's names and words like
"secret", "password", "school", "education" or other info.  And easier way to get onto the
shared disk is to get on it directly from a sysadmin computer.  Here is a way to get acess to one:

  1) While your class is doing a report get some info on it onto a Mac formatted disk.
  2) Right after school gets out, find a nice teacher that looks busy.
  3) Tell him/her that you have info on a Mac disk and you need to get it put onto an IBM disk
        so you can take it home to work on (tell him you have and IBM at home).
  4) Ask him how you would do that (even though you probably know) just to act stupid.
  5) He should tell you how and let you use the computer.
  6) Start to copy the files and reformatt like you are supposed to be doing really slow until
       he turns his back.
  7) FIND the sysadmin shared disk and copy as much info as you can into a folder marked personal
       on the disk.
  8) Finish the copying and formatting.

      The reason you named it personal is in case he wants to look in the folder you can just
tell him its private.  Now you can read all the info and alter it to your liking.  This may
containt info on passwords and other important stuff.  After you edit it on the disk do the same
trick again either the next day (pretend you need to change them back to Mac files) or some 
other day to a different teacher and replace the info currently on there with the new stuff.
If the reformat trick doesn't work here are some others:

  - One day when you get in trouble and are in the principal or vice-principals office, if he
leaves the room for a while, really quickly copy the files.  This is why you should ALWAYS carry 
a disk in you pocket.  It will come in handy.

  - Simply sneak into a clasroom while the teacher's at lunch

      Fun stuff you can get off the net.  Go to El Grande's Mac Hack page (just look up 
"El Grande's Mac Hacks" on infoseek).  There are a bunch of cool Mac tricks that are very good
for usage on school computers.


      Hacking from home:  I'm not quite sure if it would be any use, but here is a way to get
the phone number of any school computer:

  If your phone company has a number you can dial to find out where you are at (like 811) then
just do this:  Go into a terminal (such as Microsoft Works Communications), dial 811 and listen
really closesly to the computer.  You should be able to make out a number.

  If your phone company has no such service then try this:

    Right before you come home from school do this:

   1) Go into a terminal (such as Microsoft Works Communications)
   2) Dial your home phone number and let someone pickup and say "Hello" about 5 times or if no
one's home just let it ring for a while.
   3) Go directly home, imediately.
   4) Run to the phone and dial *69
   5) If no one has called after you did, it should tell you the number of the computer you 
dialed from.

       Thats about it.  This whole time I have been under the assumption that your school uses
Macs.  If it doesn't there are many more tricks you can do on a PC as long as you know your 
way around DOS.  If you are fluent with DOS you have infinite power on a PC.
