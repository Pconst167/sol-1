 THIS IS THE SECOND PART OF IN-DEPTH
COMMAND & SUB COMMAND'S. READ PART I
OF HACKING RAMPART SYSTEMS BEFORE THIS.

   ->PUT TESTLINE

PUT TYPE TESTLINE (AT) CENTRAL^OFFICE
IN (OR OUT OF SERVICE)

MAKES A TESTLINE AVAILABLE OR UN-
AVAILABLE FOR TESTING BY RAMPART (HAS
NO PHYSICAL EFFECT ON THE EQUIPMENT
ITSELF.)

O   POSSIBLE TESTLINE TYPES: 100, 102,
  103, 104, 105

O   CENTRAL^OFFICE CAN BE A COMMON
  LANGUAGE CODE OR A LITERAL CENTRAL
  OFFICE NAME (CON).

   ->PUT PORT

PUT PORT NUMBER (OR ALL) QUALIFIER

ALTERS THE CONFIGURATION OF RAMPART
TEST PORTS.

   ->TERMINAL

TERMINL <(IS) TERMINAL@TYPE>

DISPLAYS THE DEVICE NUMBER OF THE
TERMINAL CURRENTLY IN USE & OPTIONALLY
DEFINES THE TERMINAL USER'S TERMINAL
TYPE.

VALUES FOR 'TERMINAL@TYPE':CRT, NO CRT,
VT100, VT101, VT131, VT125 (USE 'NO
CRT' FOR HARD COPY TERMINALS. NO CRT IS
THE DEFAULT WHEN LOGGING IN ON REMOTE
TERMINALS)

NOTE: THE CORRECT TERMINAL TYPE MUST BE
DEFINED TO ENABLE CERTAIN PLOTS AND
GRAPHS ON THE RAMPART SYSTEM.

   ->TEST

THIS CLASS OF CMDS ENABLES THE RAMPART
USER TO PERFORM DEMAND TESTS. IF ALL
TEST PORTS ARE IN USE, DEMAND REQUESTS
ARE PUT INTO THE DEMAND QUEUE & TESTED
IN 'FIRST IN  - FIRST OUT' ORDER.

O  'TESTLINE' DEFAULTS TO 105 IF NOT
  SPECIFIED.

O  'TRUNK NUMBERS' DEFAULT TO ENTIRE
  TRUNK GROUP IF NOT SPECIFIED

O  'TESTS' DEFAULT TO 2-WAY LOSS AND

  THE TESTS THE THE RAMPART SYSTEM IS
CAPABLE TO PERFORM ARE:

   'L4'=TWO WAY LOSS AT 404 HZ,-16 DB
  'L10'=TWO WAY LOSS AT 1004 HZ, -16 DB
  'L28'=TWO WAY LOSS AT 2804 HZ, -16 DB
    'N'=NEAR TO FAR NOISE
   'RN'=FAR TO NEAR NOISE
   'NT'=TWO WAY NOISE WITH TONE
  'ERL'=ECHO RETURN LOSS
  'SRL'=SINGING RETURN LOSS
'SRLHI'=HIGH SINGING RETURN LOSS

'ALL' PERFORMS ALL TESTS AVAILABLE ON
FAREND RESPONDER SPECIFIED.

AVAILABLE SELFCHECKS:
 'LSC', 'LSC4', 'LSC10', 'LSC28', 'NSC'
'RNSC','NTSC', 'ERLSC', 'SRLSC','SHISC'

    ->REPORT RUT

ALLOWS THE USER TO SPECIFY REPORTING ON
ALL THE SPECIFIED RUT PW IN THE DB.
IF THE RUT PW IS NOT SPECIFIED IN THE
CMD LINE, THE USER IS PROMPTED FOR THE
RUT PW TO USE IN REPORT SELECTION
(RUT IS A ACRONYM FOR REMOTE USER
TERMINAL)

EXAMPLE: 'REPORT RUT AAA'
         'REPORT RUT' (PROMPTS FOR RUT
PW)
