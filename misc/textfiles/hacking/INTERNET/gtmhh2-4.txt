GUIDE TO (mostly) HARMLESS HACKING

Vol. 2 Number 4

More intro to TCP/IP: port surfing! Daemons! How to get on almost any
computer without logging in and without breaking the law. Impress your
clueless friends and actually discover kewl, legal, safe stuph. I'll bet
se7en doesn't know how to do all this...
______________________________________________________________

A few days ago I had a lady friend visiting. She's 42 and doesn't own a
computer. However, she is taking a class on personal computers at a
community college. She wanted to know what all this hacking stuph is about.
So I decided to introduce her to port surfing. And while doing it, we
stumbled across something kewl.

Port surfing takes advantage of the structure of TCP/IP. This is the
protocol (set of rules) used for computers to talk to each other over the
Internet. One of the basic principles of Unix (the most popular operating
system on the Internet) is to assign a "port" to every function that one
computer might command another to perform. Common examples are to send and
receive email, read Usenet newsgroups, telnet, transfer files, and offer Web
pages.


************************
Newbie note #1: A computer port is a place where information goes in or out
of it. On your home computer, examples of ports are your monitor, which
sends information out, your keyboard and mouse, which send information in,
and your modem, which sends information both out and in.

But an Internet host computer such as callisto.unm.edu has many more ports
than a typical home computer. These ports are identified by numbers. Now
these are not all physical ports, like a keyboard or RS232 serial port (for
your modem). They are virtual (software) ports.
************************

So if you want to read a Web page, your browser contacts port number 80 and
tells the computer that manages that Web site to let you in. And, sure
enough, you get into that Web server computer without a password.

OK, big deal. That's pretty standard for the Internet. Many -- most --
computers on the Internet will let you do some things with them without
needing a password.

However, the essence of hacking is doing things that aren't obvious. That
don't just jump out at you from the manuals. One way you can move a step up
from the run of the mill computer user is to learn how to port surf. I'll 
bet you won't find port surfing in a Unix manual.

The essence of port surfing is to pick out a target computer and explore it
to see what ports are open and what you can do with them.

Now if you are a lazy hacker you can use canned hacker tools such as Satan
or Netcat. These are programs you can run from Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris
(all types of Unix) from your PC. They automatically scan your target
computers. They will tell you what ports are in use. They will also probe
these ports for presence of daemons with known security flaws, and tell
you what they are. 

********************************
Newbie note # 2: A daemon is not some sort of grinch or gremlin or 666 guy.
It is a program that runs in the background on many (but not all) Unix
system ports. It waits for you to come along and use it. If you find a
daemon on a port, it's probably hackable. Some hacker tools will tell you
what the hackable features are of the daemons they detect.
********************************

However, there are several reasons to surf ports by hand instead of
automatically.

1) You will learn something. Probing manually you get a gut feel for how the
daemon running on that port behaves. It's the difference between watching an
x-rated movie and (blush).

2) You can impress your friends. If you run a canned hacker tool like Satan
your friends will look at you and say, "Big deal. I can run programs, too."
They will immediately catch on to the dirty little secret of the hacker
world. Most hacking exploits are just lamerz running programs they picked up
from some BBS or ftp site. But if you enter commands keystroke by keystroke
your friends will see you using your brain. And you can help them play with 
daemons, too, and give them a giant rush.

3) The truly elite hackers surf ports and play with daemons by hand because
it is the only way to discover something new. There are only a few hundred
hackers -- at most -- who discover new stuph. The rest just run canned
exploits over and over and over again. Boring. But port surfing by hand 
is on the path to the pinnacle of hackerdom.

Now let me tell you what my middle-aged friend and I discovered while just
messing around. 

First, we decided we didn't want to waste our time messing with some minor
little host computer. Hey, let's go for the big time! 

So how do you find a big kahuna computer on the Internet? We started with a
domain which consisted of a LAN of PCs running Linux that I happened to
already know about, that is used by the New Mexico Internet Access ISP:
nmia.com.

*****************************
Newbie Note # 3: A domain is an Internet address. You can use it to look up
who runs the computers used by the domain, and also to look up how that
domain is connected to the rest of the Internet.
*****************************

So to do this we first logged into my shell account with Southwest
Cyberport. I gave the command:

<slug> [66] ->whois nmia.com
New Mexico Internet Access (NMIA-DOM)
   2201 Buena Vista SE
   Albuquerque, NM 87106

   Domain Name: NMIA.COM

      (505) 877-0617

   GRANDE.NM.ORG                129.121.1.2

Now it's a good bet that grande.nm.org is serving a lot of other Internet
hosts beside nmia.com. Here's how we port surfed our way to find this out:

<slug> [67] ->telnet grande.nm.org 15

Whoa! What was all that?

What we did was telnet to port 15 -- the netstat (network statistics)
port-- which on some computers runs a daemon that tells anybody who cares
to drop in just about everything about the connections made by all the
computers linked to the Internet through this computer. 

So from this we learned two things:

1) Grande.nm.org is a very busy and important computer.

2) Even a very busy and important computer can let the random port surfer
come and play.

So my lady friend wanted to try out another port. I suggested the finger
port, number 79. So she gave the command:

<slug> [68] ->telnet grande.nm.org 79
Trying 129.121.1.2 ...
Connected to grande.nm.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
finger
?Sorry, could not find "FINGER"
Connection closed by foreign host.
<slug> [69] ->telnet grande.nm.org 79
Trying 129.121.1.2 ...
Connected to grande.nm.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
help
?Sorry, could not find "HELP"
Connection closed by foreign host.
<slug> [69] ->telnet grande.nm.org 79
Trying 129.121.1.2 ...
Connected to grande.nm.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
?
?Sorry, could not find "?"
Connection closed by foreign host.
<slug> [69] ->telnet grande.nm.org 79
Trying 129.121.1.2 ...
Connected to grande.nm.org.
Escape character is '^]'.
man
?Sorry, could not find "MAN"
Connection closed by foreign host.
<slug> [69] ->

At first this looks like just a bunch of failed commands. But actually this
is pretty fascinating. The reason is that port 79 is, under IETF rules,
supposed to run fingerd, the finger daemon. So when she gave the command
"finger" and grande.nm.org said ?Sorry, could not find "FINGER," we knew
this port was not following IETF rules.

Now on may computers they don't run the finger daemon at all. This is
because finger has so properties that can be used to gain total control of
the computer that runs it.

But if finger is shut down, and nothing else is running on port 79, we
should get the answer: 

	telnet: connect: Connection refused.

But instead we got connected and grande.nm.org was waiting for a command. 

Now the normal thing a port surfer does when running an unfamiliar daemon
is to coax it into revealing what commands it uses. "Help," "?" and "man"
often work. But these didn't help us. 

But even though these commands didn't help us, they did tell us that the
daemon is probably something sensitive. If it were a daemon that was meant
for anybody and his brother to use, it would have given us instructions.

So what did we do next? We decided to be good Internet citizens and also
stay out of jail. We decided we'd beter log off.

But there was one hack we decided to do first: leave our mark on the shell
log file.

The shell log file keeps a record of all operating system commands made on a
computer. The administrator of an obviously important computer such as
grande.nm.org is probably competent enough to scan the records of what
commands are given by whom to his computer. Especially on a port important
enough to be running a mystery, non-IETF daemon. So everything we typed
while connected was probably saved on a log.

So my friend giggled and left a few messages on port 79 before logging
off. Oh, dear, I do believe she's hooked on hacking. What a good way to
meet cute sysadmins... 

So, port surf's up! If you want to surf, here's the basics:

1) Get logged onto a shell account. That's an account with your ISP that
lets you give Unix commands. Or -- run Linux or some other kind of Unix on
your PC and hook up to the Internet.

2) Give the command "telnet <hostname> <port number>" where <hostname> is the
internet address of the computer you wnat to visit and <port number> is
whatever looks phun to you. 

3) If you get the response "connected to <hostname>," then surf's up!

Following are some of my favorite ports. It is legal and harmless to pay
them visits so long as you don't figure out how to gain superuser status
while playing with them. However, please note that if you do too much port
surfing from your shell account, your sysadmin may notice this in his or her
shell log file. Or, the sysadfmin of your target computer may report you 
to your sysadmin. Yau will be identifieable by the headers on the packets 
carrying your commands to the target computer. Then if your sysadmin is 
kicked off your ISP. So you may want to explain in advance that you are
merely a harmless hacker looking to have a good time, er, um, learn about
Unix. Yeh, that sounds good...

**************************
Propeller head tip: Note that in most cases an Internet host will use these
port number assignments for these services. More than one service may also
be assigned simultaneously to the same port. This numbering system is
voluntarily offered by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). That
means that an Internet host may use other ports for these services. Expect
the unexpected! 

If you have a copy of Linux, you can get the list of all the IETF
assignments of port numbers in the file /etc/services.
