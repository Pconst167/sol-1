                    Mail Spoofing Explained

NOTE: this was written with newbies in mind, thats why it's so simple and
through. If you're more advanced, bear with it :)
Ok, here is the most through, and explained mail spoofing article ever
writen. First of all, let's define mail spoofing. Have you ever wanted to
mail somebody annonymously? Have you ever wanted to send mail from adresses
such as nasa.com, fbi.org, or just about anything else? Of course you have!
All we need is a telnet client. This method uses a very simple thing called
smtp, which stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Wait, don't run away
yet, it may sound complicated but it really isn't. Here are the steps you
have to take:

   * telnet to port 25 of any web server
   * type: mail from: spoofed@adress.com
   * type: rcpt to: recipient@of.the.letter.org
   * type: data
   * type: your message here
   * type: .

Does this seam unclear to you? Well, I thought of that, below are step by
step instructions for windows95:

If you're runing win 95:

   * click on start, and chose run
   * type: telnet in the dialog box
   * press enter-a telnet client pops up
   * click on "terminal" menu
   * chose preferences
   * make sure that "Enable local echo" is checked
   * click on the "connect" menu
   * click on "remote system"-a dialog box pops up
   * enter any adress in the dialog box (example: www.omnics.co.jp)
   * see where it says "port" delete the stuff inside, and type number 25
   * click connect

Ok, now we're connected to the host, see the little greeting message? good.
Now issue the following command just like you see them: Replace the
xxx@xxx.xxx.xxx with anything you want, my personal favorite is
president@whitehouse.org be creative ;)

   * mail from: xxx@xxx.xxx.xxx
   * rcpt to: place the adress where you wanna send the mail to here
   * data
   * type your message here
   * .
   * (yes, that is a period by itself ;)

Boom, you're done, the mail has been sent :) Wanna hear a funny thing? This
isn't even illegal :)

Here's a more info on this, which is intented for a bit more advanced
users, newbies are welcome to read this too, it explains how this works.
You see, port 25 is the mail port. When you telnet to the mail port, you
get to talk to the mail daemon. Mail daemons, speak smpt. Interested in
learning more about smpt? After connecting to the host, just type "help"
and you'll get some commands to play around with.
