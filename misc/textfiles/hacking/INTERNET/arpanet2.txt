LEARNING WHO's WHO
------------------

     As mentioned earlier, ARPANET can be made to disclose a great deal of
information before you have logged on or even hacked a password.  Among the most
useful commands are those that tell you who else is on the system and what the
status of the system is.  These files give you information that will help your
future hacking activities.  In this section we discuss commands that disclose
data about users that are available from the EXEC level.

@HELP WHOIS  <user entry>

NICNAME (alias WHOIS) is a utility for cross-net access of the NIC user
registration database.  NICNAME has been chosen as the global name for the
program, although many sites will choose to use the more familiar WHOIS name for
the program.

For the convenience of sites without user programs to interact with the NICNAME
server, WHOIS may be run on the SRI-NIC machine via Telnet service without
logging in.  The documentation below is slightly inaccurate in this case,
since there is no need to reach further through the net to access the database,
as the user program and the database are both on SRI-NIC.

The initial procedure is a one-reach, one-response query, which allows users at
any Internet site to obtain information about an organization or individual by
providing either a name or an IDENT.  The protocol used is a TCP protocol.  A
server program running at SRI-NIC takes the user's request, accesses the NIC
database and sends back the reply.

The reply can be in one of three forms:
     1)  Record for individual or organization found, information (including
         name, ident, organization, mailing address and network address) is
         returned to user.
     2)  Given name matches more than one record.  A short entry is returned for
         each matching record and the ueer is told to re-query the system using
         the ident to match any one iddividual or organization shown.
     3)  No record matched.  If an ident was given, this response means that the
         ident is free for use by an individual or organization, and can be
         obtained for such by contacting NIC.

     Examples of use follow.  For clarity, the user's typeing appears in
uppercase:

I.  Request for help information.

@WHOIS
Ident: ?
; Accessing NICNAME server at SRI-NIC...
    Please enter a name or a handle ("ident"), such as "Smith" or "SRI-NIC".
Starting with a period forces a name-only search; starting with exclamation
point forces handle-only.  Examples:
      Smith           [looks for name or handle SMITH]
      !SRI-NIC        [looks for handle SRI-NIC only]
      .Smith, John    [looks for name JOHN SMITH only]
    Adding "..." to the argument will match anything from that point, e.g.
"ZU..." will match ZUL, ZUM, etc.
    To search for all the authorized users of a host, use:
      %HOST
    To search for mailboxes, use one of these forms:
      Smith@          [looks for mailboxes with username SMITH]
      @Host           [looks for mailboxes on HOST]
      Smith@Host      [Looks for mailboxes with username SMITH on HOST]
    To have the ENTIRE membership list of a group or organization, if you are
asking about a group or org, shown with the record, use an asterisk character
"*" directly preceding the given argument.  [CAUTION: If there are a lot of
members this will take a long time!]
    You may of course use exclamation point and asterisk, or a period and
asterisk together.

II.  Search by name only.

@HELP SYSTAT
The SYSTAT command lists information about jobs logged into the system in order
of job number, along with the date and time, how long the system has been up,
the number of jobs logged in, and load average information.

If the user is logged in from another host, the name of that host is given under
the Foreign host heading.

For example:
@systat
 Tue 14-Aug-84 15:29:38  Up 45:40:40
 20+13 Jobs   Load av   1.70   1.33   1.43

  18    54  TYPE    OLE
  19     3  EXEC    SAPPHO
  20*   51  SYSTAT  STACIA
  22    11  EXEC    SAPPHO
  25    60  MM      OLE
There are a number of arguments which can be given to the SYSTAT command.  These
can be listed by typing SYSTAT ?.  These arguments include:
 .    All    Charge    Class     Controlling
Directory     Header    In-Class     Limit     Line
 Lpt     No     Program     State     System
 Time     What     Where     Who
  or user name
  or directory name
  or Decimal job umber
  or ","
  or confirm with carriage return

combinations of arguments may be given:

@sys stacia all header

The first listed all SYSTAT information about user STACIA.  The second listed
all of the information given before, without listing the connected directory.

WHAT's AVAILABLE ON THE DDN
---------------------------

@NIC  <enter NIC after @ prompt>
TOP   <enter TOP to start at beginning of file>

NIC/Query is a database system containing information about the Defense Data
Network (DDN), including MILNET and ARPANET.  Each list of topics is presented
to the user as a numbered menu of selections.

- To see more detail on any of the topics below, type its corresponding number
followed by a carriage return, <CR>.

- To leave NIC/Query, type 'quit<CR>'.

- For more help and additional commands, type 'help<CR>'.

   1. INTERNET PROTOCOLS -- Describes Internet protocols
   2. PROGRAMS -- Describes programs available on DDN hosts
   3. PERSONNEL -- Directory of DDN users
   4. HOSTS -- Describes DDN hosts
   5. RFCS -- Requests For Comments technical notes
   6. IENS -- Internet Experiment Notes
   7. NIC DOCUMENTS -- Documents available from the NIC

_ for back, ^ for up, + for top, or menu # (1-7): QUIT  <let's return to this
menu later>

LOGING OUT
-----------

You haven't really loged in yet, and a quick way of loging out is to enter a
"C" at the prompt or to simply unplug your phone.  However, ARPANET's own files
can be revealing:

@HELP KK

The LOGOUT command logs you off of the system and expunges all deleted files in
your directory.  Synonyms for LOGOUT include K and KK.

You may also log out another job logged in on your account by specifying the
job number after the LOGOUT command.  In this case a message describing the job
to be logged out is printed, and a confirming RETURN is required.

If your job hangs, you might wish to log in at another terminal and then LOGOUT
the other job, as described in the last paragraph.  First find the other job
number, as follows:
        @systat jsmith
          27*   54  SYSTAT  JSMITH
          32   112  BASIC   JSMITH
The * indicates the job number of the job issuing the SYSTAT command.  You will
want to use the other job number -- 32 in this case:
        @logout 32
         JSMITH, TTY112, BASIC
        [Confirm]
and you confirm by pressing the RETURN key.

MORE HELP
---------

@HELP ATTACH
ATTACH allows you to move a job to a different terminal or to return it to a
terminal from detached status.

To ATTACH, say
    @attach USERNAME
    Password:
At the Password prompt, type in your password (which will not be echoed to the
screen) and your job will be attached.

If you have more than one job logged on to the system, you will need to supply
a job number after your username.  Finger yourself to find out this information.
If you are attaching a job which is already attached to another terminal, you
will be asked to confirm with carriage return before the Password prompt.
