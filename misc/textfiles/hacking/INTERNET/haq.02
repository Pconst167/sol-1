VI. NEWBIES READ THIS
     (Basic Hacking)

WHAT MAKES A SYSTEM SECURE?
(from alt.security FAQ)
"The only system which is truly secure is one which is switched off
and unplugged, locked in a titanium lined safe, buried in a concrete
bunker, and is surrounded by nerve gas and very highly paid armed
guards.  Even then I wouldn't stake my life on it."
                                     - originally from Gene Spafford

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHAT WOULD BE IDEAL PROTECTION OF A SYSTEM?
Password Access- Get rid of simple passwords; routinely change all
                 passwords; regular review/monitoring of password
                 files

Physical Access- Lock up terminals, personal computers, disks when
                 not in use; eliminate unnecessary access lines;
                 disconnect modems when not in use

Other measures-  Know who you are talking to; shred all documents;
                 avoid public domain software; report suspicious
                 activity (especially non-working hours access)

What this all means is that hackers must now rely on the ineptitude
and laziness of the users of the system rather than the ignorance
of SysOps.  The SysOps and SecMans (Security Managers) are getting
smarter and keeping up to date.  Not only that, but they are
monitoring the hack/phreak BBSes and publications.  So the bottom
line is reveal nothing to overinquisitive newbies...they may be
working for the wrong side.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHAT IS A FIREWALL?
(from the comp.security.misc FAQ)
A (Internet) firewall is a machine which is attached (usually)
between your site and a Wide Area Network (WAN).  It provides
controllable filtering of network traffic, allowing restricted
access to certain Internet port numbers and blocks access to
pretty well everything else.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW TO HACK WITHOUT GETTING INTO TROUBLE AND DAMAGING COMPUTERS?
 1.  Don't do damage intentionally.
 2.  Don't alter files other than than to hide your presence or to
     remove traces of your intrusion.
 3.  Don't leave any real name, handle, or phone number on any
     system.
 4.  Be careful who you share info with.
 5.  Don't leave your phone number with anyone you don't know.
 6.  Do NOT hack government computers.
 7.  Don't use codes unless you HAVE too.
 8.  Be paranoid!
 9.  Watch what you post on boards, be as general as possible.
10.  Ask questions...but do it politely and don't expect to have
     everything handed to you.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHAT DO I DO IF I AM GETTING NOWHERE?
1.  Change parity, data length, and stop bits.  The system may not
    respond to 8N1 (most common setting) but may respond to 7E1,8E2,
    7S2, etc.
2.  Change baud rates.
3.  Send a series of carriage returns.
4.  Send a hard break followed by a carriage return.
5.  Send control characters.  Work from ^a to ^z.
6.  Change terminal emulation.
7.  Type LOGIN, HELLO, LOG, ATTACH, CONNECT, START, RUN, BEGIN, GO,
    LOGON, JOIN, HELP, or anything else you can think off.

=====================================================================
VII. Screwing with the most widespread operating system on the net
     (UNIX / AIX Hacking)

WHAT ARE COMMON DEFAULT ACCOUNTS ON UNIX?
(from Belisarius)
Common default accounts are root, admin, sysadmin, unix, uucp, rje,
guest, demo, daemon, sysbin.  These accounts may be unpassworded
or the password may possibly be the same (i.e. username uucp has
uucp as the passwd).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW IS THE UNIX PASSWORD FILE SETUP?
(from Belisarius)
The password file is usually called /etc/passwd
Each line of the passwd file of a UNIX system follows the following
format:


    userid:password:userid#:groupid#:GECOS field:home dir:shell


What each of these fields mean/do---

userid       -=>  the userid name, entered at login and is what the
                  login searches the file for.  Can be a name or a
                  number.

password     -=>  the password is written here in encrypted form.
                  The encryption is one way only.  When a login
                  occurs the password entered is run through the
                  encryption algorithm (along with a salt) and then
                  contrasted to the version in the passwd file that
                  exists for the login name entered.  If they match,
                  then the login is allowed.  If not, the password is
                  declared invalid.

userid#      -=>  a unique number assigned to each user, used for
                  permissions

groupid#     -=>  similar to userid#, but controls the group the user
                  belongs to.  To see the names of various groups
                  check /etc/group

GECOS FIELD  -=>  this field is where information about the user is
                  stored.  Usually in the format  full name, office
                  number, phone number, home phone.  Also a good
                  source of info to try and crack a password.

home dir     -=>  is the directory where the user goes into
                  the system at (and usually should be brought
                  to when a cd is done)

shell        -=>  this is the name of the shell which is
                  automatically started for the login

Note that all the fields are separated by colons in the passwd file.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHAT DO THOSE *s, !s, AND OTHER SYMBOLS MEAN IN THE PASSWD FILE?
(from Belisarius)
Those mean that the password is shadowed in another file.  You have
to find out what file, where it is and so on.  Ask somebody on your
system about the specifics of the Yellow Pages system, but
discretely!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHAT IS A UNIX TRIPWIRE?
(from Belisarius)
Tripwire is a tool for Unix admins to use to detect password cracker
activity, by checking for changed files, permissions, etc.  Good for
looking for trojan horses like password stealing versions of
telnet/rlogin/ypcat/uucp/etc, hidden setuid files, and the like.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

USING SUID/GUID PROGS TO FULL ADVANTAGE.
(from Abort)
A SUID program is a program that when executed has the privs of the
owner.
A GUID has the privs of the group when executed.
Now imagine a few things (which happen often in reality):
1.  Someone has a SUID program on their account, it happens to allow
a shell to, like @ or jump to a shell.  If it does that, after you
execute said file and then spawn a shell off of it, all you do
in that shell has the privs of that owner.
2. If there is no way to get a shell, BUT they leave the file
writable, just write over it a script that spawns a shell, and you
got their privs again.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW CAN I HACK INTO AN AIX MACHINE?
(from Prometheus)

If you can get access to the 'console' AIX machines have a security
hole where you can kill the X server and get a shell with
ctrl-alt-bkspce.  Also by starting an xterm up from one you are not
logged in the utmp for that session because the xterms don't do utmp
logging as a default in AIX.  Or try the usual UNIX tricks:
ftping /etc/passwd, tftping /etc/passwd, doing a finger and then
trying each of the usernames with that username as a password.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW CAN I INCREASE MY DISK QUOTA ON UNIX?
(from Prometheus)

A UNIX disk quota may be increased by finding a directory on another
partition and using that.  Find another user who wants more quota and
create a directory for the other to use, one that is world writable.
Once they've put their subdirectory in it, change the perms on the
directory to only read-execute.  The reason this works is that
usually accounts are distributed across a couple of filesystems, and
admins are usually too lazy to give users the same quotas on each
filesystem.  If the users are all on one filesystem, you may be able
to snag some space from one of the /usr/spool directories by creating
a 'hidden' subdirectory like .debug there, and using that.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW CAN I FOOL AROUND ON XTERM / XWINDOWS?
(from Wildgoose)
Most x commands have a -display option which allows you to pick a
terminal to send to. So if you use bitmap to create a bitmap, or
download one, etc then:

xsetroot -bitmap bitmapname
[display the bitmap on your screen]

xsetroot -bitmap bitmapname -display xt2500:0
[display the bitmap on another xterm]

Other uses, try xterm -display xt??:0 will give someone else one of
your login windows to play with.  They are then logged in as you
though, and can erase your filespace, etc. Beware!

Slightly irritating:
xclock -geom 1200x1200 -display xt??:0
[fills the entire screen with a clock]

Slightly more irritating:
Use a shell script with xsetroot to flash people's screens different
colors.

On the nastier side:
Use a shell script with xsetroot to kill a person's window manager.

Downright nasty:
Consult the man pages on xkill.  It is possible to kill windows on
any display.  So to log someone off an xterm you merely have to xkill
their login window.

Protect yourself:
If you use xhost -   this will disable other people from being able
to log you out or generally access your terminal.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW CAN I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DECODE DAEMON?
(from Caustic)
First, you need to make sure that the decode daemon is active.
Check this by telnetting to the smtp port (usually port 25), and
expanding user Decode.  If it gives you something, you can use it.
If it tells you that the user doesn't exist, or whatever, you can't.

If the daemon is active, this is how to exploit the decode daemon:
1) uuencode an echo to .rhosts
2) pipe that into mail, to be sent to the decode daemon
(What happens: the decode daemon (1st) decodes the process, but
leaves the bin priveleges resident. (2nd) the echo command is
executed, because now the decoded message assumes the bin priveleges
[which are *still* active, even though the daemon didn't issue the
command]).
3) If this is done right, you will be able to rlogin to the sysem.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW CAN I GET THE PASSWORD FILE IF IT IS SHADOWED?
(from Belisarius)
If your system has Yellow Pages file managment:

ypcat /etc/passwd > whatever.filename

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HOW IS A PASSWORD ENCRYPTED IN UNIX?
(from UNIX System Security[p.147])
     Password encryption on UNIX is based on a modified version of
the DES [Data Encryption Standard].  Contrary to popular belief, the
typed password is not encrypted.  Rather the password is used as the
key to encrypt a block of zero-valued bytes.
     To begin the encryption, the first seven bits of each character
in the password are extracted to form the 56-bit key.  This implies
that no more than eight characters are significant in a password.
Next, the E table is modified using the salt, which is the first two
characters of the encrypted password (stored in the passwd file).
The purpose of the salt is to makae it difficult to use hardware DES
chips or a precomputed list of encrypted passwords to attack the
algorithm.  The DES algorithm (with the modified E table) is then
invoked for 25 iterations on the block of zeros.  The output of this
encryption, which is 64 bits long, is then coerced into a
64-character alphabet (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "." and "/").  Because this
coersion involves translations in which several different values are
represented by the same character, password encryption is essentially
one-way; the result cannot be decrypted.

VIII. Screwing with the most secure operating system on the net
     (VAX/VMS Hacking)

WHAT IS VAX/VMS?

VAX: Virtual Address eXtension.  Computer is desisgned to use memory
     addresses beyond the actual hardware and can therefore run progs
     larger than physical memory.  Developed by Digital Equipment
     Corporation (DEC).

VMS: Virtual Memory System.  Also developed by DEC.

DCL: Digital Command Language.  Similar to DOS batch language or
     UNIX script language.

IX. Screwing with the most widespread operating system on PCs
     (MS-DOS Hacks)

HOW TO REALLY **ERASE** A HARDDRIVE
(from Amarand)
Install a small program (in the Dos directory would be good) called
Wipe, by Norton Utilities.  I am pretty sure that executing this
program, using the proper command line options, you can for one
better than formatting the hard drive.  Wiping the information
changes each bit in the object (file, FAT, disk, hard drive) to a
zero...or a random bit, or an alternating bit instead of just
deleting the reference to it in the file allocation table.  If you
just delete a file, or format a hard drive...with the new Dos you
would only need to let it run its course and then Unformat the drive.
Wipe, I have found, works much more effectively by first erasing the
file allocation table AFTER erasing the information the file
allocation table is used to find.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WRITING A .bat FILE TO 'WIPE' A DRIVE.
Add the following code to the end of autoexec.bat:
echo Please wait
echo Checking HardDisk for virii, this make take a while ...
wipe > nothing.txt

This prevents any output from Wipe being output.

=====================================================================
X. Finding out what that encrypted info is
     (Cracking programs)

WHAT ARE PASSWORD CRACKING PROGRAMS?
(from Belisarius)
There are three main cracking programs.  They are Crack, Cracker Jack
and Cops.  The latest versions are 4.1 for Crack and 1.4 for Cracker
Jack.  Crack and COPS run on UNIX and CJack runs on a PC. CJack1.3
runs on any x86 class and CJack1.4 needs at least a 386.  To use any
of these requires access to an unshadowed password file.
They are not programs that try to login to an account.  They take the
password file (/etc/passwd in UNIX is usually the name) and guess the
passwords.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHERE CAN I GET THESE PROGRAMS?

Crack:         ftp.virginia.edu         /pub/security
CrackerJack:   bnlux1.bnl.gov           /pub/pezz
COPS:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHAT IS WPCRACK?
WPCRAK is a cracker to break the encryption on WordPerfect files.
It works, but takes a long time to run.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WHAT IS PKCRACK?
PKCRACK is a dictionary cracker for PKZIP.  It works.  It's
dictionary, but it works.  Not all that well, as you may have to sift
through multiple possible passwords, but its better than nothing.

=====================================================================
XI. How do I keep my info secure
     (PGP / Cryptology)

WHAT IS PGP?
(from Belisarius)
PGP stands for Pretty Good Protection, from a company called Pretty
Good Software.  It is a public key encryption program for MS-DOS,
Unix, and Mac.  You create a key pair.  One private (secret) key
and a public key.  The keys are different parts of the whole.  I
distribute my public key and anyone who wants can grab it ad it to
their PGP keyring.  Then when they want to send me a message they
encrypt it with PGP and my public key and then send it.  Only I can
decrypt it because you need my secret key to decode it.  (Trust me
you won't get my secret key)  That is PGP.  Please use it if you
want to communicate anything of a ahhhh....sensitive manner.

HOW TO MAKE NITRIC ACID:
(from Neurophire)

Nitric acid is not TOO expensive, but is hard to find except from
chemical supply houses.  Purchases can be traced.(From TBBOM13.TXT)

There are several ways to make this most essential of all acids for
explosives. One method by which it could be made will be presented.
again, be reminded that these methods SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT!!

     Materials:                             Equipment:
     ----------                             ----------
     sodium nitrate or                      adjustable heat source
     potassium nitrate
                                            retort
     distilled water
                                            ice bath
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid                          stirring rod

                                            collecting flask with
                                            stopper

1) Pour 32 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid into the retort.

2) Carefully weigh out 58 grams of sodium nitrate, or 68 grams of
potassium nitrate. and add this to the acid slowly.  If it all does
not dissolve, carefully stir the solution with a glass rod until
it does.

3) Place the open end of the retort into the collecting flask, and
place the collecting flask in the ice bath.

4) Begin heating the retort, using low heat.  Continue heating until
liquid begins to come out of the end of the retort.  The liquid that
forms is nitric acid.  Heat until the precipitate in the bottom of
the retort is almost dry, or until no more nitric acid is forming.
CAUTION: If the acid is heated too strongly, the nitric acid will
decompose as soon as it is formed.  This can result in the
production of highly flammable and toxic gasses that may explode.
It is a good idea to set the above apparatus up, and then get away
from it.

     Potassium nitrate could also be obtained from store-bought black
powder, simply by dissolving black powder in boiling water and
filtering out the sulfur and charcoal. To obtain 68 g of potassium
nitrate, it would be necessary to dissolve about 90 g of black powder
in about one liter of boiling water.  Filter the dissolved solution
through filter paper in a funnel into a jar until the liquid that
pours through is clear. The charcoal and sulfur in black powder are
insoluble in water, and so when the solution of water is allowed to
evaporate, potassium nitrate will be left in the jar.

HOW TO MAKE HIGH FREQUENCY TONES TO ANNOY SOMEONE?
(from Angel of Death with Belisarius)

The idea is to make a simple timing circuit to create a high freq
tone.  The timing circuit is based upon the 555-chip and uses a
simple speaker to convert the pulses from the 555 into sound.

Required materials: 555 timer chip, 9 V battery, .01 uF capacitor,
                        100k potentiometer, tweeter speaker, wire
                    (the capacitor and resistor values can vary
                     although that changes the possible freqs)

HOW IS CABLE TV SCRAMBLED?
(from Aero)

There are three main types of scrambling for cable TV: trap filters,
gernaral scrambling and addressable scrambling.

1.  Trap filters.  Located in the distribution box and physically
prevent the desired channel from reaching your house.  All you see
when this techniques is used is theoretically static (i.e. a blank
channel).  No filter is perfect, so some signal may reach your TV.
This is an older system of cable protection, and it is easy to bypass
(go out to the box and remove the filter).

2.  General scrambling.  This system scrambles the pay channels (all
the channels before they reach the box), and you need a special
decoder to unscramble them.  The most common method of scambling is
to remove the sync signal. This is also easy to get around as you
can buy descramblers.

3.  Addressable descramblers.  The cable box receives the scrambled
channels, but the cable company sends signals to the box telling it
which ones should be unscrambled.  This is the system used by most
pay-per-view systems.  This is a little harder to defeat, but not too
bad if you have the right equipment/friends.
