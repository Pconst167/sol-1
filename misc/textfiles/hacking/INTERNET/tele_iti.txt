         arriving from the terminal which, when exceeded, causes the
         network to transmit any accumulated characters to the Host.
         Values are:

             0  Timer disabled
         2-255  Multiples of 50 ms (.05 seconds)

         Note: Default is 80 (4 seconds)


   36    Interval Timer

         The Interval Timer specifies the maximum time period during which
         the network PAD will accumulate characters before forwarding them
         to their destination.  Values are:

             0  Timer disabled (Default)
         2-255  multiples of 50 ms (.05 seconds)


   37    Network Usage Display

         This controls the transmission of information on chargeable network
         usage provided at the end of a virtual call.  Values are:

             0  Exclude network-generated usage information
                from the DISCONNECTED message (Default)

             1  Include network-generated usage information
                from the DISCONNECTED message


   38    Carriage Return Padding (Variable)

         This specifies the amount of time-delay padding to be provided
	 after each carriage return sent to the terminal, for every 10
	 printable characters on the line (E.g., no padding for nine
	 characters; five time the value of parameter 38 for 50 characters.)
	 Values may run from 0 through 7.


   39    Padding Options

         This parameter specifies whether or not the network provides time
         delay padding after form effectors sent to the terminal.  Values
         are:

             0  Network provides no time delay padding

             1  Network provides time delay padding (Default)
                after CR, LF, and HT characters


   40    Insert on Break

         This specifies whether or not the PAD inserts the Break Code in the
         data stream at the point at which the break signal is received from
         the terminal.  Values are:

             0  Do not insert on break (Default)
             1  Insert Break Code on break


  +41    PAD-to-Terminal Flow Control

         This parameter specifies network XON/XOFF control of transmission
         from the terminal.  Values are:

             0  No PAD-to-Terminal Flow Control (Default)
             1  Network provides flow control


   42    PAD-to-Terminal XON Character

         This identifies the character which, when sent from the network to
         the terminal, causes the terminal to resume transmission of
         buffered data.  Value may be any character from 1 to 127.  Default
         is 17 (19 octal, 11 hex).


   43    PAD-to-Terminal XOFF Character

         This identifies the character which, when sent from the network to
         the terminal, causes the terminal to temporarily suspend
         transmission of buffered data.  Value may be any character from 1
         to 127.  Default is 19 (21 octal, 13 hex).


  *44    Generate Break

         This parameter used to cause a break signal to be transmitted
         from the PAD to the terminal.  It is no longer valid to set this
         parameter.


  *45    APP on Break

         This parameter specified whether or not the PAD transmitted a
	 SET & READ PARAMETERS PAD Message to the Host system when a break
	 signal was received from the terminal.  This parameter should no
	 longer be used.

             0  No SET & READ PARAMETERS PAD Message (Default)
                generated on break

             1  SET & READ PARAMETERS PAD Message generated
                on break


  *46    Input Unlock Option

         This archaic parameter specifies what action the PAD took after the
         terminal user had entered a line of data, the keyboard had been
         locked, and the PAD had no data to deliver to the terminal. Values
         are:

             0  Unlock based on timer expiration (Default)
             1  Unlock based on input data content


  *47    Input Unlock Timer

         This archaic parameter specified the time interval that the PAD
	 would wait before unlocking the terminal keyboard, if the PAD had
	 no data pending delivery to the terminal and parameter 46 was set
	 to 0.  Values ranged from 0 through 255 multiples of 50 ms (.05
	 seconds).  Default was 0 seconds.


  *48    Input Unlock Character

         This archaic parameter specified the character which, when appearing
	 at the beginning of a data line, caused the PAD to leave the keyboard
         locked at the end of the data line (if there is no data pending
         delivery to the terminal).  Value was any character code from 0
         through 127; or 240, which leaves the keyboard locked after all
         characters. Default was 0.


  *49    Output Lock Option

         This archaic parameter specified the action the PAD took when it
	 received data for delivery to the terminal, when the keyboard was
	 unlocked for input from the terminal.  Values are:

             0  Discard output data
             1  Transmit output after input completion
             2  Transmit output id input idle (Default)


  *50    Output Lock Timer

         This archaic parameter defined the interval between characters
	 arriving from the terminal which, when exceeded, caused the PAD
	 to lock the keyboard when it had output pending delivery to the
	 terminal.  Values may range from 0 through 255 multiples of 50 ms
	 (.05 seconds).  Default was 10 (500ms).


  *51    Output Lock Option

         This archaic parameter specified what action the PAD took after it
	 had transmitted all pending data to the terminal.  Values are:

             0  Unlock based on timer (Default)
             1  Unlock based on output completion
             2  Unlock based on output data content


  +53    Break Options

         This allows for a combination of options for handling break signals
         from the terminal.  Values may be OR-ed together:

             0  No options selected (Default)
             1  Interrupt on break
             4  APP on break
            32  Insert on break

         Note, X.3 parameter 7 should be used instead of this parameter


   54    Terminal-to-PAD Flow Control

         This parameter specifies XON/XOFF control of transmission from the
         network.  Values are:

             0  No Terminal-to-PAD flow control (Default)
             1  Network respects flow control


   55    Terminal-to-PAD XON Character

         This identifies the character which, when sent to the network,
         causes the network to resume the transmission of buffered data.
         Value may be any character code from 1 through 127.  Default is 17
         decimal.


   56    Terminal-to-PAD XOFF Character

         This identifies the character which, when sent to the network,
         causes the network to temporarily suspend the transmission of
         buffered data.  Value may be any character code from 1 through 127.
         Default is 19.


   57    Connection Mode

         This parameter specifies which level of terminal code conversion
         the PAD is to perform during data transfer mode.  Values are:

             0  Transparent
             1  Real
             2  Virtual  (Default)


  +58    Connection Escape

         This parameter specifies whether or not the terminal may escape
         from Data Transfer mode to Network Command mode.  Values are:

             0  Escape not possible
             1  Escape possible (Default)


  *59    Flush Output on Break

         This parameter specified whether or not the PAD transmitted a SET &
         READ PARAMETER PAD Message to the Host and began discarding output
         to the terminal when a break signal was received from the terminal.
	 Rather than using this parameter set X.3 parameter 7 to 21
	 (decimal).

             0  No SET & READ PARAMETERS PAD Message (Default)
                sent and no output flushed

             1  SET & READ PARAMETERS PAD Message sent and output
                to the terminal


   60    Delayed Echo

         This parameter identified whether echo from the PAD to the terminal
	 will occur immediately or whether it will be delayed to appear
	 between data from incoming packets.  If 60:1, then once the PAD has
	 begun processing an incoming packet, it will buffer echo characters
	 until it completes the packet.  At that point, it will transmit all
	 buffered echo characters back to the terminal before processing the
	 next incoming packet.  Values are:

             0  Echo immediately   (Default)
             1  Delay echo to occur between incoming packets


   63    Eight-bit Transparency

         This parameter identifies whether the terminal uses the eighth
	 (most significant) bit for data or as a parity bit.  Note, if
	 Telenet parameter 57:2, this parameter cannot be set to zero. 
	 Values are:

             0  No parity, eight-bit transparency
             1  Parity required (Default)


   64    Early ACK

         This parameter specifies whether or not the PAD for terminal
         support should acknowledge data packets received for the terminal
         prior to transmitting the packets (in the form of a character
         stream) to the terminal.  Values are:

             0  Acknowledge data packets after transmission
                to the terminal (Default)

           1-7  Acknowledge data packets 1-7 packets prior to
                transmission to the terminal

         Note:  *Extreme Caution* should be exercised when modifying this
                parameter.  The increased "artificial window" size does not
                guarantee packet delivery to the terminal.  Large amounts of
                data could be lost from any form of network disconnect.
                Values of 5 or greater should never be used.


   65    M-bit handling

         This parameter specifies whether the terminal PAD will set the M-bit
	 on all full packets, on certain full packets, or on packets.  Values
	 are:

             0  M-bit is always zero
             1  M-bit is set to one for certain full packets
             3  M-bit is set to one in all full packets  (Default)

         If parameter 65:1, the PAD will set the M-bit on all full packets
	 except where the last user-entered character is a data-forwarding
	 character, as defined by X.3 parameter 3 (Transmit Mask).  If,
	 however, the final character in the packet is a carriage return and
	 X.3 parameter 13 causes a line feed insertion following the carriage
	 return and X.3 parameter 3 marks carriage return as a data-forwarding
	 character, then the M-bit will be set to 1.  The PAD will then 
	 transmit a second packet, with M-bit set to 0, containing only a
	 line feed character.

	 If, after sending a packet with M-bit set to one, the PAD must send
	 a data-qualified packet (Q-bit=1), this is considered a data-
	 forwarding condition.  Thus, the PAD will send a data packet with
	 M-bit = 0 containing the characters currently in its buffer.  If
	 the buffer is empty the PAD will send an empty packet with M-bit = 0.
	 This prevents a protocol violation.


   66    Defer Processing of User Input

	 This parameter instructs the PAD to halt processing of user input
	 data and buffer the data (to a maximum of 32-64 characters).  Upon
	 disconnect, parameter 66 is rest and processing of user data resumes.
	 If the disconnect triggers a reselection (e.g., forwarding of the
	 call by TAMS), the buffered data is sent to the new called DTE
	 Otherwise, or if reselection fails, the data is interpreted by the
	 PAD as a command during command mode.  Values are

             0  Process user input normally (Default)
	     1  Defer processing of user input data

   67    ESP Packetizing Option

	 This parameter specifies whether accumulated data is to be packet-
	 izied when the Escape Sequence Initiator is received (i.e., before
	 the Escape Sequence) and when the Escape Sequence is completed. 
	 Values are:

                   Packetize   Packetize
		    Before       After

	     0        No          No    (Default)
	     1        No          Yes
	     2        Yes         No
	     3        Yes         Yes


   68    Escape Sequence Timer

	 This parameter specifies the maximum idle time allowed before ESP
	 processing expires.  Values range from zero through 255 and
	 represent 50 ms intervals.  Resolution of the timer is zero to 
	 minus 50 ms (e.g., a value of 2 represents 50ms < timer < 100ms).
	 Default is zero.


   69    Escape Sequence Maximum Length
	
	 This parameter specifies the maximum number of characters that may
	 be contained in an Escape Sequence, including the Escape Sequence
	 Initiator.  A value of zero disables parameter 69 and the maximum
	 Escape Sequence is 128 characters.  Default is zero and values
	 greater than 127 are not allowed.

	
   70    Escape Sequence Initiator

	 This parameter specifies the seven-bit representation of the Escape
	 Sequence Initiator character (values 1-127).  The default value of
	 zero disables Escape Sequence Processing altogether.


   71    Parameter Reset on Disconnect

	 This parameter specifies the manner in which parameters are to be 
	 treated upon disconnect.  Values are:

             0  Reset ITIs to their initial values  (Default)
	     1  Do not reset ITIs, except for reselect-related
		parameters (66 and 71)
	     2  Do not reset ITIs, except set 66:0 and 71:1
	     3  Do not reset ITIs, except set 66:0

	 Value 1 makes parameter 71 a "one-shot" parameter, this is it 
	 clears itself after being invoked once.  Value 2 is a "two-shot"
	 value and value 3 leaves parameter 71 active until explicitly
	 reset.
