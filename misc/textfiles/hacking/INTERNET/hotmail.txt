---------------------------------->The Hotmail Hack<----------------------------------------
============================================================================================
============================================================================================

	This file is all about Hotmail free internet based e-mail and how to gain access to 
any account you want.  (Well...almost).  Anyways, I am not responsible for anything you do
with the information in this file and all the rest of the preeching to do with illegal stuff.
You may redistribute this file AS IS, you may not change the file in any way without my written 
permission.  This is the first file that I have written as a hacker and I did it for the 
group which I have just joined, "The United Underground" also known as "u2".  Anyways...enuph
of this boring junk and on with the fun stuff!!!!!


==============
==BACKGROUND==
==============

First a little bit of explanation about hotmail for those of you who are constipated in the 
brain.

Hotmail is, as I hope you know, a webased e-mail system.  Which in turn means that it uses cgi-
bin as a gateway to there local mashine where all the passwords are and e-mails are stored.  
Hotmail requires you to enter a login name on one page and a password on another, this is the
first key to this hack.  When in a Hotmail account there are many options you may choose such
as reading mail deleting mail, changeing the interface and so on.  The last option is the logout
option, wich is the second key to this hack.  For this hack you must know the user name of your
victim..err...subject.  This is always the name in front of the @ in their e-mail address, so 
that is easily obtained.  You must also be using a browser which enables you to view the source
code for the page you are currently viewing.  That is really it...So what's the catch you say?
Well yes...there is a catch, and I'm sure as I study the system more closely it will become
obsolete.  But for now, your subject MUST be stupid enough to either forget, or not bother
to logout once they are done in the system.  THAT IS THE KEY TO THIS HACK!!!!!!


==========
==HOW TO==
==========

Now for the steps of the hack......

//////
step 1
//////

The first step is to get the username of the subject and go to www.hotmail.com and login with
that user name.   Make sure you have typed the username exactly right because hotmail will not
tell you if you have typed it incorrectly, they also log the IP's of people entering incorrect
login names.

//////
step 2
//////

It is now time to view the source code of the password page that you are on now.  It should
say www.hotmail.com/cgi-bin/password.cgi in the URL box.  Anyways, view the source for this 
page.  Five lines down or so from the top of the source code page, it will say

<form name="passwordform" action="URL" method="POST" target="_top">

That is a very important line....but before I tell you how to use that line, I'm going to side
track for a little theory behind this hack.  Because there's NO point in a hack, if you
don't know how it works.  That is the whole idea of hacking, to find out how systems work.
So anyways, when you login to hotmail, the cgi-bin gateway marks you as being IN the system.
If you don't logout, and you just leave the page, or turn off your computer, the Hotmail
system doesn't know that you are gone from your account.  So back to the real text.

The action="URL" part of the line above is where the subjects account is located.  So after the
real owner of the account has loged in and given his/her password, they will go to a page that 
says......

http://somenumber/cgi-bin//start/username/anothernumber

in the URL box......

//////
step 3
//////

Hmmmmm...funny thing, that's the same number that we obtained earlier in this text from the 
source code for the password page.  So after you have that URL, you must type in into the URL
box ONLY!!!!  You can not click the open button, or use an open command for reasons that are
way beond the grasp of this text.  So after you've entered that URL, press enter, and watch
as hotmail gives you complete access over the subjects Hotmail account.

/Now remember that this hack ONLY works if the owner of the account does NOT logout from his/  /
/her account.  Also, please have mercey for the poor idiot on the other end that owns the      /
/account, and do not delete any messages or any shit like that.  Just be happy that you DID    /
/gain access to the account and then leave.  I have set up a hotmail account with a few e-mails/
/going in and out of there every once in a while.  The address is oxyenn@hotmail.com (yes, that/
/is an extra n on oxygen, don't forget it).  Hack this account freely, I realy don't care, but /
/please don't go using it to compose harassing or anonomous e-mail.  That is lame, and if I do /
/find anyone doing it, I will find your IP from the login sequence, and trac you down, or, if  /
/any legal action results in it, report your ip to the authorities.  So please, it would be    /
/alot easier if you just co-operate.  Thank you:)                                              /

This file was made for newbies, and those who are always looking to learn.  Not for all you
expirienced hackers who know it all, unless you realy wanted to read it.  So don't bother 
mailing u2 or me (if you somehow get my e-mail address) flamming us or shit like that.
