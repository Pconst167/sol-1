INTRODUCTION
    
    iNet 2000, or as marketing people like to call it "the intelligence 
network", is a Telecom Canada production, and comes off like another overblown
online service, such as Compuserve or Prodigy. It is, however, mainly 
supposed to be business related. Although it does have the usual forums(SIGs
on other Online Services), files & bulliten's, they are all primarily based
around business in some manifestation.
    Another interesting thing is that it is based almost entirely around 
Packet-Switching Networks, in specific Datapac(because it's Telecom Canada's), 
but also Sprintnet and Tymnet in the U.S.. While Compuserve and the majority 
of other Online Services do have PSN Dialin NUA's(Network User Address), they
are usually based on local direct dialins. This is not the case with iNet 
2000. iNet 2000 is only accessible from NUA's at this point, possibly an 
attempt by Telecom Canada to raise awareness of their PSN.
    Now, while there is not much to tell about hacking iNet, i will run 
through how to identify the system, the User ID/Password format, and a few
of the working NUA's.

HACKING PROCEDURE

    First off, for those anxious to get a feel for the system, here are a few
of the NUA's...
        302079100067
        302079100068
        302087100024
        302087100025
From within the Datapac system, the DNIC(3020) is not needed, but it is 
required from other Packet-Switching Networks.
    When you connect to an iNet 2000 NUA, the login prompt
        User-id/Code D'usager:
The iNet 2000 userid's are usually in the format of JM.SMITH, or J.SMITH, as
in initials + surname. iNet will NOT inform you if this is incorrect. It will
proceed to the password prompt, which is
        Password/Code de securite
The iNet 2000 password format is such  
        - Case Sensitive
        - Between 6 & 8 Characters in length
        - Must contain at least one alphabetic and one numeric character
        - Must contain at least one special character(!,#,S,&,&,-, or *)
        - The first character must be alphanumeric
And to add on that, the password MUST be changed within 3 months, or a prompt
for a new password will come up and force you to pick one.
Oh, and you can reach Customer Service at     
        1-800-267-8480
        1-416-862-1717
If you think you can Social Engineer an account

CONCLUSION

    As you can see, hacking iNet is rather futile, if not pointless. I always
wondered why people would spend hours hacking Online Service accounts so they
could spend 3 days or so downloading rad peedee programs and playing those
wicked online games. This service is even more boring, and even harder to 
hack. My suggestion to the masses - Go hack a Unix(or HP3000 or whatever) 
instead..
