Below are the current lists of values known at BBN for: Ethernet
Type Fields; Ethernet Address Vendor assignments; Ethernet
Multicast Address assignments.  As these values are not published
by the IEEE, we maintain these lists for OUR use, and for distribution.


Current Ethernet and IEEE802.3 "Type" Fields            5/5/88

The 13th and 14th octets of an Ethernet or IEEE802.3 packet (after the preamble)
consist of the "Type" or "Length" field. These are formerly assigned by
Xerox, currently assigned by IEEE. Some assignments are public, others private.
Information currently available includes: Xerox Public Ethernet Packet
Type documentation; IEEE802.3 Std, but not yet further documentation from
IEEE; NIC RFC960; knowledge of some BBN Private Type Field values.

Ethernet hardware addresses are 48 bits, expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits
(0-9, plus A-F, capitalized). These 12 hex digits consist of
the first/left 6 digits (which should match the vendor of the Ethernet interface
within the station) and the last/right 6 digits which specify the interface
serial number for that interface vendor.

Currently we have noted the following vendor addresses, on the
BBN Corporate Ethernet.

Ethernet addresses might be written unhyphenated (e.g. 123456789ABC),
or with one hyphen (e.g. 123456-789ABC), but should be written hyphenated
by octets (e.g. 12-34-56-78-9A-BC).

These addresses are physical station addresses, not multicast nor
broadcast, so the second hex digit (reading from the left)
will be even, not odd.

At present, it is not clear how the IEEE assigns Ethernet block addresses.
Whether in blocks of 2**24 or 2**25, and whether multicasts are assigned
with that block or separately. A portion of the vendor block address
is reportedly assigned serially, with the other portion intentionally
assigned randomly. If there is a global algorithm for which addresses
are designated to be physical (in a chipset) versus logical
(assigned in software), I am unaware of the algorithm.
