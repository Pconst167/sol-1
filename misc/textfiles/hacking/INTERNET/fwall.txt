Ok, The Internet Firewall is a strange beast when you find one. It is for those
of you who don't know, a system that secures off a part of the net for pricate 
or more interestingly for government use. You'll find things like the FBI,CIA
etc.. all on the other side of a firewall of some desciption. My research to 
date has mainly been into the firewall that the FBI has, as that was the very
first such address I got.

I was hanging around the IRC on csdvax at nsw uni and a friend happened to
mention the address just as he logged off... it was pbi.fbi.gov, so i being the
good little hacker that i am had a pen beside me and wrote it down to look into
later on. Unfortunately this friend of mine is in Israel and was just leaving 
when he gave it to me so i didn't have time to ask him anything about it.

l8r on i tried the address and found it came back with 'network unreachable'.
I found this odd as he had given me the address that he obviously had connected
to himself so i was wondering what the fuck was going on right? I got onto irc
and asked a dude in #hack about it. He said the FBI has a firewall and then he
went all quiet and wouldn't say another bloody word about it. Now just about 
everyone knows that irc is logged. If you say anything like 'hack' 'hacked'
'password' 'passwd' etc.. the line of text gets written into a log.. and i mean
who wouldn't log it? i would too so u can't blame them. Anyhow i bugged this guy
'til he finally said 'get onto 'talk' and phne me' so i did, i phoned his 
account and said 'ok what's the story' and he gave me the following.

Apparently the FBI,CIA,IRS and other such secure conscious departments all have
computers with ip set up so they only have to sit there and make sure that the
rest of their small network is secure, they are called 'firewalls' and are easy
to hack if u know wot u are doing. apparently on unix machines there is an ftp
command called 'dig' if u login to anonymous ftp sites u can get the binary file
off them. if you dig certain addresses that you know to be behind a firewall
you can find information about the site. it gives you teh address of all such
sites with a certain name in it such as

dig fbi.gov any any

this will give you output like this

(this looks a mess as it was buffered from irc with someone who had a unix in
front of them and did this for me).

Basically you can see from here where the other nodes are that incorporate 
fbi.gov. 

Recently I have also found that UTS actually switches packets through to the FBI
firewall to be allowed or denied access. This brings me to the second use for
the FBI firewall. It seems that at times they DO want people from outside the
wall to be able to access their computers. And to do this they have set up a
file with addresses that are allowed to access the computers behind the wall.
Now by logging UTS with one of the various logging programs I'd say that these
nodes could be easily found, as the programs (the good ones) log where the 
connections are made from and to and the login id and password of course.

The only problem with this is that I have found UTS to be one of the most secure
universities on the network in sydney. However nothing is impossible and UTS is
certainly not hack proof.

The most interesting feature of the Wall is it's CPU power. I am wondering what 
it could do with a good unix version of Killer Cracker running on it! ;)
Imagine 'Hacker Caught running Password Hacking programs on FBI's security 
Computer' hahaha nice... anyhow the idea is NOT to get caught. ;)

Anyhow down here I will list a few interesting nodes down for your testing.
ARD.FBI.GOV - FBI's Firewall computer.
PBI.FBI.GOV - Unknown FBI node behind firewall.
ULTIMA.SOCS.UTS.OZ.AU - UTS SunOS.
csdvax.csd.unsw.edu.au - UNSW's vax for students mainly.
hydra.maths.unsw.edu.au - UNSW's math unix system.
dslt4a.faceng.su.oz.au - Sydney Uni's Faculty Enginerring Computer.(easy)
IRS.GOV - The IRS of course. ;)
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the cia was CIA.GOV or something stupid
like that so I might try it when I get back on the net.
