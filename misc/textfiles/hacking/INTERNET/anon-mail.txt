Welcome to Hackerdevil's guide on how to send ANONYMOUS e-mails to someone without a prog.

 I am Hackerdevil and i am going to explain ya a way to send home-made e-mails. I mean its a way to send Annonimous e-mails without a program, it doesn't take
to much time and its cool and you can have more knowledge than with a stupid program that does all by itself.

This way (to hackers) is old what as you are newby to this stuff, perhaps you may like to know how these anonymailers work, (home-made)

Well.....
Go to Start, then Run...
You have to Telnet (Xserver) on port 25

Well, (In this Xserver) you have to put the name of a server without the ( ) of course...
Put in iname.com in (Xserver) because it always work it is a server with many bugs in it.
(25) mail port.

So now we are like this.

telnet iname.com 25

and then you hit enter
Then When you have telnet open put the following like it is written

helo

and the machine will reply with smth.

Notice for newbies: If you do not see what you are writing go to Terminal's menu (in telnet) then to Preferences and in the Terminal Options you tick all opctions available and in the emulation menu that's the following one you have to tick the second option.
Now you will se what you are writing.

then you put:

mail from:<whoeveryouwant@whetheveryouwant.whetever.whatever> and so on...
If you make an error start all over again

Example:
mail from:<askbill@microsoft.com.net>

You hit enter and then you put:

rcpt to:<lamer@lamer'sworld.com>
This one has to be an existance address as you are mailing anonymously to him.

Then you hit enter
And you type
Data
and hit enter once more

Then you write

Subject:whetever

And you hit enter

you write your mail

hit enter again (boring)

you put a simple:
.

Yes you don't see it its the little fucking point!
and hit enter
Finally you write
quit
hit enter one more time
and it's done

look:Try first do it with yourself I mean mail annonymously yourself so you can test it!
Don't be asshole and write fucking e-mails to big corps. bec' its symbol of stupidity and childhood and it has very very effect on Hackers they will treat you as a Lamer!

Really i don't know why i wrote this fucking disclaimer, but i don't want to feel guilty if you get into trouble....

Disclamer:Hackerdevil is not responsable for whetever you do with this info. you can destribute this but you are totally forbidden to take out the "By Hackerdevil" line. You can't modify or customize this text and i am also not responsable if you send an e-mail to an important guy and insult him, and i rectly advise you that this is  for educational porpouses only my idea is for learning and having more knowledge, you can not get busted with this stuff but i don't take care if it anyway happen to you.  If this method is new for ya probably you aren't a hacker so think that if someone wrote you an e-mail "yourbestfirend@aol.com"  insulting you and it wasn't him it but was some guy using a program or this info you won't like it.so Use this method if you don't care a a damn hell or if you like that someone insult you.
