                            ------- -   ------------



     Because  of many customer complaints concerning PC Pursuit's inability
     to allow file transfers, Field Operations  was  requested  to  provide
     recommendations  for  file transfer via PC Pursuit. In compliance with
     this request, this document provides the following:

     *  Recommendation on the best file transfer protocols to be used
        with PC Pursuit.

     *  Recommendation on the hunt-confirm sequence and line parameters
        which provide optimum performance of various protocols.

     *  The average transfer rates which can be expected using the
        correct hunt-confirm sequence and optional parameter settings.

                          SECTION 2.: Recommendations
                          ------- -   ---------------



     This section outlines the most common  file  transfer  protocols  used
     with  PC  Pursuit. The performance of the protocols in the direct con-
     nect and PC Pursuit environments are also indicated.

     The following protocols were tested via the  Chicago  in-dial  to  the
     Washington DC out-dial; the observations are summarized below.


     XMODEM

     PC Pursuit XMODEM file transfers performed at an average throughput of
     34%  when  the  correct  hunt-confirm  and terminal type was utilized.
     XMODEM does not support flow control, therefore it is  suggested  that
     the  "relaxed"  mode  be invoked if the user's communications software
     permits this feature.


     YMODEM

     The performance of YMODEM file transfers VIA PC Pursuit was  found  to
     have  an  average  throughput of 77% when the correct hunt confirm and
     terminal type is employed.  Although  YMODEM  does  not  support  flow
     control, it uses large 1024 byte packets which the network PAD handles
     quite  readily  under  normal conditions. As a result, YMODEM is rated
     one of the faster protocols for file transfer via PC Pursuit.


     WXMODEM

     WXMODEM file transfers utilizing the correct hunt-confirm and terminal
     type performed well  with  an  average  transfer  rate  of  82%.  This
     protocol  is  capable  of  handling  flow  control which enables it to
     perform with better reliability in the PC Pursuit  environment.  Users
     should  be  aware  that an early version of PROCOMM is known to have a
     software problem which can affect  the  performance  of  WXMODEM  file
     transfers.


     KERMIT

     An  optimum  average  throughput  of  65%  was obtained by KERMIT file
     transfers via PC Pursuit. The throughput was obtained  with  a  packet
     size of 90 and a window size of 31. KERMIT software which supports the
     sliding  window  feature  performs  with  optimum efficiency in the PC
     Pursuit environment.









                                      - 2 -                                







     SEALINK

     SEALINK file transfers via PC  Pursuit  performed  exceptionally  well
     with  an  average  throughput of 91% with the correct hunt-confirm and
     terminal type. SEALINK supports  flow  control  and  was  specifically
     designed  to  operate  in the networking environment. Some versions of
     SEALINK however, do not provide proper error recovery which could pose
     a problem for some users.


     ZMODEM

     File transfers utilizing ZMODEM protocol via  PC  Pursuit  yielded  an
     average  transfer  rate of 93%. ZMODEM performs well in the PC Pursuit
     environment at the default settings. Depending on  the  type  of  user
     equipment,  ZMODEM  options  may need to be modified to permit optimum
     throughput. The ZMODEM command line used in our test configuration was
     simply as follows:


         Uploads:     DSZ port 1 rz
         Downloads:   DSZ port 1 sz


     The  X.3  PAD  parameters  which  provide  optimum   performance   are
     1:0,4:10,5:1, 7:8,12:1. In addition, flow control (XON/XOFF) should be
     enabled  at  the user PC and the host. It should be noted that in most
     cases these additional PAD parameters are optional and  need  only  be
     employed if the user is experiencing difficulty transferring files via
     ZMODEM.

     The  following  page  summarizes  file  transfer  performance  of  the
     protocols tested. The protocols are  listed  in  order  (PCP  best  to
     worst)  in  two categories: 1) performance via direct connect, 2) per-
     formance via PC Pursuit utilizing the  recommended  hunt  confirm  and
     parameter  settings  shown.  It  should  be  noted  that  the optional
     parameters need only be employed if a user experiences  problems  with
     transferring a particular file.

                      SECTION 3.: File Transfer Procedures
                      ------- -   ------------------------


     This  section  outlines  the step by step procedure for executing file
     transfers via PC Pursuit. These procedures must be followed exactly to
     achieve optimum transfer rates. The optional X.3 parameters  shown  on
     the  previous  page  indicates  the  parameters which provide the best
     transfer rates as well as reduce the possibility of aborts.



     STEP 1.:    Set PC communications software to 8 bits, no parity,
                 1 stop bit, full duplex. At this time, the user may wish
                 disable or enable local (XON/XOFF) flow control depending
                 on the type of protocol to be used.

     STEP 2.:    Dial local rotary with the communications software
                 set at the desired speed.

     STEP 3.:    Upon connect use the correct hunt confirm sequence:
                     At 300/1200bps use - <CR D CR>
                     At 2400bps         - <@ D CR>
                     NOTE: "D" MUST BE UPPER CASE.

     STEP 4.:    At prompt "TERMINAL = " enter  <D1> and return.

     STEP 5.:    At the "@" prompt enter the destination mnemonic,
                 out-dial speed, ID and password.  It is important
                 that out-dial speed matches in-dial speed.
                 DO NOT MIX IN-DIAL AND OUT-DIAL SPEEDS.

     STEP 6.:    If OPTIONAL X.3 pad parameters are to be changed, do
                 so at this point by entering <@ CR>. To set parameters
                 as prescribed perform the following:

                 To set parameters enter <SET parameter,parameter>
                     Example: SET 7:8,4:10,5:1,7:8,12:1
                 To read parameters enter <PAR?>

                 Return to out-dial port by entering
                 <CONT>.

     STEP 7.:    Upon connecting to the destination pad, ensure
                 communication with the out-dial modem by entering <ATZ>.
                 The destination modem will respond with "OK".

     STEP 8.:    Enter <ATD> and the local number you wish to dial.

     STEP 9.:    Queue host file transfer and start file transfer.

     Please note that these are the basic steps needed to achieve  success-
     ful  file  transfers.  Since  communications  software  may  vary from
     package to package, additional steps may be  needed  to  initiate  the
     start of the file transfer at the user software level.

                              SECTION 4.: Summary
                              ------- -   -------


     Extensive testing has resulted in identifying the expected performance
     of  six  file  transfer  protocols  when  used  with PC Pursuit. These
     protocols have been  determined  to  perform  satisfactorily  with  PC
     Pursuit  when  the  correct hunt-confirm, terminal type and parameters
     are employed.

     It is the recommendation of Field Operations  that  customers  be  in-
     formed of the correct logon procedures and the protocols which provide
     the  most  reliable  file transfers. Customers should also be reminded
     that PCP users can expect a small degree of  network  delay  which  is
     considered  a  common  characteristic  of packet switched networks. In
     addition, users should also be informed that poor quality voice  grade
     telephone lines can adversely affect file transfer sessions.

     Field  Operations is one of many Sprint groups dedicated to providing
     customers with complete support for PC Pursuit. Field Operations  will
     offer assistance with file transfer problems providing the customer is
     willing  to  release a copy of the problem software as well as provide
     the pertinent information necessary to resolve the problem.

                          SECTION 5.: Troubleshooting
                          ------- -   ---------------



     If you are experiencing trouble with PC Pursuit  check  the  following
     items:

     * Verify the correct hunt-confirm sequence

     * Verify user software comm parameters are set to 8 bits, no parity and
       1 stop bit.

     * If problems with file transfer only, try the optional ITI PAD parameters.



     If all else fails, then call Sprint Customer Service and report the
     problem. Be prepared to provide the following:

      * Type of communication software
      * Type of PC, make and model
      * Type of modem
      * Call origin (in-dial city)
      * Call destination (out-dial city)
      * Speed in
      * Speed out
      * Type of session
      * Time of failure
      * Date of failure
      * Point of failure in session
      * Out-dial number
      * Network Addresses (shown at login, and by command "STAT"
                           when connected to out-dial port)

     Additional information may be required depending on the nature of
     the problem.
