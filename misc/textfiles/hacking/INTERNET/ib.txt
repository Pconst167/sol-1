The ultimate mailbomber would be, by definition, one that not only
sends a large volume of mail, but does so quickly and without a large
cost in bandwidth of the computer that you are running.  It would also
be untraceable.  The infinite mailbomb fits all of these criteria in
such a way that makes it quite possibly the best mail bombing approach
ever created.  As such, it can also serve as a very effective
denial-of-service attack.

With that said, here is how to set up, and set off, the infinite mailbomb:

1)  Set up two accounts at http://mailhost.net
The accounts in this example are abc@mailhost.net and xyz@mailhost.net

2)  In the settings of abc@mailhost.net make it forward to xyz@mailhost.net
and to the target (in this example, lamer@aol.com)

3)  In the settings of xyz@mailhost.net make it forward to abc@mailhost.net
and to the target (in this example, lamer@aol.com)

4)  Send a message through a mixmaster or cypherpunks chain remailer to
abc@mailhost.net and make the return address that of the target
(lamer@aol.com in this example) so that once the server which is being
bombed starts to bounce messages, it will be bouncing to itself.

5)  Wait for as long as you want.  The longer you wait, the more messages
will be sent (obviously).  Also, since mailhost.net adds a small message
at the bottom of each message that is sent through it, the message will
grow bigger and bigger.  This is what's happening as you wait:  abc@mailhost.net
has forwarded the message it received to lamer@aol.com and do xyz@mailhost.net,
which has in turn forwarded to lamer@aol.com and back to abc@mailhost.net, where
the cycle starts once more.  The bounces between the mailhost.net accounts
happens very quickly, and since mailhost.net has a multi-T3 connection to
the internet, it is sending messages very fast to lamer@aol.com

6)  Once you have decided to stop the bombing (if you do decide to stop it,
let it run at least overnight first), simply change the settings of
abc@mailhost.net so that it doesn't forward to anywhere.  Next time you want
to use this technique, just set it so that it once again forwards to
xyz@mailhost.net and also to your new target, for example lamer2@aol.com.  Then
just change the settings of xyz@mailhost.net so that instead of forwarding to 
lamer@aol.com it forwards to lamer2@aol.com

Denial-of-service with this is simple:  pick a server and send an infinite bomb
to the root account of the server (root@the.target.server).  This will eventually
fill up the hard drive of the server, and quite possibly crash it.
