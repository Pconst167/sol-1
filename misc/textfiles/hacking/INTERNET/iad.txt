To advertise by msging,inviting, or noticing everyone on a server is pretty easy to do.

Follow these steps: 
          Download massirc.exe* [26.6k] and you might also need cswsock.vbx [28.5k] 

          Run it, you'll have an intro screen then a settings screen fill them out just like 
          your normal mirc but don't use same nick as the one that you normally use. 
          
          This works only on certain servers and here's a list of them: 
               us.undernet.org 
               us.chatnet.org 
               us.icenet.org 
               irc.aohell.org 
               home.metnet.com 
               irc.pontocom.com.br 
               atlanta.ga.us.galaxynet.org 
               ocean.us.austnet.org 
               irc2.sodre.net 
               sunrise.ca.us.another.net 
               Shadow.FL.US.EarthInt.Net 
               rochester.mi.us.starlink.org 
               us.dal.net 
          
          If it works on a server I don't have on there then tell me the address of that server. 
          once they are all set click next. It will connect to the server then click next again. 
          
Ok Let me explain the options: 

Send Notice Messages this will notice every user on the system your message. 

Send PrivMsg will msg every user on the system your message. 

Send Invite this will invite them to a channel. 

Randomly Change NickName every 10 seconds this is a definite must to be checked in 
unless you like to be klined or glined alot. 

Send 1 packet every seconds this should be set somewhere from 5-8, I prefer 7 
this is to keep the server's flood protection off your ass. 

Start Sending Nick with letter, well if you got knocked off before set it to the last 
letter it was at or leave it at a, this is the letter of the users name it starts at. 

A blank box, in here enter the chan to invite them to or the message you want 
noticed or msged to them. Now with the options set, just click send now and minimize.
