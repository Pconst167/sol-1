Welcome to the World of the Internet

        The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is proud to have sponsored
the production of the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet.  EFF is a
nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to ensuring
that everyone has access to the newly emerging communications technologies
vital to active participation in the events of our world.  As more and more
information is available online, new doors open up for those who have
access to that information.  Unfortunately, unless access is broadly
encouraged, individuals can be disenfranchised and doors can close, as
well. The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet was written to help open some
doors to the vast amounts of information available on the world's largest
network, the Internet.
        The spark for the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet was ignited in
a few informal conversations that included myself and Steve Cisler of Apple
Computer, Inc., in June of 1991.  With the support of Apple Computer, EFF
engaged Adam Gaffin to write the book and actually took on the project in
September of 1991.
        The idea was to write a guide to the Internet for people who had
little or no experience with network communications.  We intended to post
this guide to the Net in ASCII and HyperCard formats and to give it away on
disk, as well as have a print edition available.  We have more than
realized our goal.  Individuals from as geographically far away as Germany,
Italy, Canada, South Africa, Japan, Scotland, Norway, and Antarctica have
all sent electronic mail to say that they downloaded the Big Dummy's Guide
to the Internet.  The guide is now available in a wide array of formats,
including ACSCII text, HyperCard, World Wide Web, PostScript and
AmigaGuide.  And the guide will be published in a printed format by MIT
Press in June of 1994.
        EFF would like to thank author Adam Gaffin for doing a terrific job
of explaining the Net in such a nonthreatening way.  We'd also like to
thank the folks at Apple, especially Steve Cisler of the Apple Library, for
their support of our efforts to bring this guide to you.
        We invite you to join with EFF in our fight to ensure that equal
access to the networks and free speech are protected in newly emerging
technologies.  We are a membership organization, and through donations like
yours, we can continue to sponsor important projects to make communications
easier.  Information about the Electronic Frontier Foundation and some of
the work that we do can be found at the end of this book.
        We hope that the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet helps you learn
about whole new worlds, where new friends and experiences are sure to be
yours.  Enjoy!

Preface
By Adam Gaffin,
Senior Writer, Network World, Framingham, Mass.
 
     Welcome to the Internet! You're about to start a journey through a 
unique land without frontiers, a place that is everywhere at once -- even 
though it exists physically only as a series of electrical impulses.  
You'll be joining a growing community of millions of people around the 
world who use this global resource on a daily basis.
     With this book, you will be able to use the Internet to:

     = Stay in touch with friends, relatives and colleagues around the 
       world, at a fraction of the cost of phone calls or even air 
       mail. 
 
     = Discuss everything from archaeology to zoology with people in 
       several different languages.    
 
     = Tap into thousands of information databases and libraries 
       worldwide.
 
     = Retrieve any of thousands of documents, journals, books and 
       computer programs.
 
     = Stay up to date with wire-service news and sports and 
       with official weather reports.
 
     = Play live, "real time" games with dozens of other people at once. 
 
     Connecting to "the Net" today, takes something of a sense of 
adventure, a willingness to learn and an ability to take a deep breath 
every once in awhile. Visiting the Net today is a lot like journeying to 
a foreign country.  There are so many things to see and do, but 
everything at first will seem so, well, foreign.  
     When you first arrive, you won't be able to read the street signs.  
You'll get lost.  If you're unlucky, you may even run into some locals 
who'd just as soon you went back to where you came from.  If this 
weren't enough, the entire country is constantly under construction; 
every day, it seems like there's something new for you to figure out. 
     Fortunately, most of the locals are actually friendly.  In fact, the 
Net actually has a rich tradition of helping out visitors and newcomers.  
Until very recently, there were few written guides for ordinary people, 
and the Net grew largely through an "oral" tradition in which the old-
timers helped the newcomers. 
     So when you connect, don't be afraid to ask for help.  You'll be 
surprised at how many people will lend a hand!
     Without such folks, in fact, this guide would not be possible. My 
thanks to all the people who have written with suggestion, additions and 
corrections since the Big Dummy's Guide first appeared on the Internet in 
1993.
    Special thanks go to my loving wife Nancy.  I would also like to 
thank the following people, who, whether they know it or not, provided 
particular help. 
    Rhonda Chapman, Jim Cocks, Tom Czarnik, Christopher Davis, David 
DeSimone, Jeanne deVoto, Phil Eschallier, Nico Garcia, Joe Granrose, 
Joerg Heitkoetter, Joe Ilacqua, Jonathan Kamens, Peter Kaminski, Thomas 
A. Kreeger, Stanton McCandlish, Leanne Phillips, Nancy Reynolds, Helen 
Trillian Rose, Barry Shein, Jennifer "Moira" Smith, Gerard van der Leun 
and Scott Yanoff. 
    If you have any suggestions or comments on how to make this guide 
better, I'd love to hear them.  You can reach me via e-mail at

Chapter 1:  SETTING UP AND JACKING IN




1.1  READY, SET ...

     The world is just a phone call away.  With a computer and modem, 
you'll be able to connect to the Internet, the world's largest computer 
network (and if you're lucky, you won't even need the modem; many 
colleges and companies now give their students or employees direct access 
to the Internet).
     The phone line can be your existing voice line -- just remember 
that if you have any extensions, you (and everybody else in the house 
or office) won't be able to use them for voice calls while you are connected 
to the Net. 
     A modem is a sort of translator between computers and the phone 
system. It's needed because computers and the phone system process and 
transmit data, or information, in two different, and incompatible 
ways.  Computers "talk" digitally; that is, they store and process 
information as a series of discrete numbers.  The phone network relies 
on analog signals, which on an oscilloscope would look like a series 
of waves.  When your computer is ready to transmit data to another 
computer over a phone line, your modem converts the computer numbers 
into these waves (which sound like a lot of screeching) -- it 
"modulates" them.  In turn, when information waves come into your 
modem, it converts them into numbers your computer can process, by 
"demodulating" them. 
     Increasingly, computers come with modems already installed. If 
yours didn't, you'll have to decide what speed modem to get.  Modem 
speeds are judged in "bps rate" or bits per second.  One bps means 
the modem can transfer roughly one bit per second; the greater the 
bps rate, the more quickly a modem can send and receive information.  
A letter or character is made up of eight bits.  
     You can now buy a 2400-bps modem for well under $60 -- and most now 
come with the ability to handle fax messages as well.  At prices that now 
start around $150, you can buy a modem that can transfer data at 14,400 
bps (and often even faster, using special compression techniques).  If you 
think you might be using the Net to transfer large numbers of files, a 
faster modem is always worth the price. It will dramatically reduce the 
amount of time your modem or computer is tied up transferring files and, if 
you are paying for Net access by the hour, will save you quite a bit in 
online charges. 
     Like the computer to which it attaches, a modem is useless 
without software to tell it how to work.  Most modems today come with 
easy-to-install software.  Try the program out. If you find it 
difficult to use or understand, consider a trip to the local software 
store to find a better program.  You can spend several hundred dollars 
on a communications program, but unless you have very specialized 
needs, this will be a waste of money, as there are a host of excellent 
programs available for around $100 or less.  Among the basic features you 
want to look for are a choice of different "protocols" (more on them in a 
bit) for transferring files to and from the Net and the ability to write 
"script" or "command" files that let you automate such steps as logging 
into a host system. 
     When you buy a modem and the software, ask the dealer how to 
install and use them.  Try out the software if you can.  If the dealer 
can't help you, find another dealer.  You'll not only save yourself a 
lot of frustration, you'll also have practiced the prime Internet 
directive:  "Ask. People Know."
     To fully take advantage of the Net, you must spend a few minutes 
going over the manuals or documentation that comes with your software.  
There are a few things you should pay special attention to: uploading 
and downloading; screen capturing (sometimes called "screen dumping"); 
logging; how to change protocols; and terminal emulation.  It is also 
essential to know how to convert a file created with your word 
processing program into "ASCII" or "text" format, which will let you 
share your thoughts with others across the Net. 
    Uploading is the process of sending a file from your computer to a 
system on the Net. Downloading is retrieving a file from somewhere on 
the Net to your computer. In general, things in cyberspace go "up" to 
the Net and come "down" to you. 
    Chances are your software will come with a choice of several 
"protocols" to use for these transfers.  These protocols are systems 
designed to ensure that line noise or static does not cause errors that 
could ruin whatever information you are trying to transfer.  
Essentially, when using a protocol, you are transferring a file in a 
series of pieces.  After each piece is sent or received, your computer 
and the Net system compare it. If the two pieces don't match exactly, 
they transfer it again, until they agree that the information they both 
have is identical.  If, after several tries, the information just 
doesn't make it across, you'll either get an error message or your 
screen will freeze.  In that case, try it again.  If, after five tries, 
you are still stymied, something is wrong with a) the file; b) the 
telephone line; c) the system you're connected to; or d) your own 
computer.
    From time to time, you will likely see messages on the Net that 
you want to save for later viewing -- a recipe, a particularly witty 
remark, something you want to write your congressman about, whatever. 
This is where screen capturing and logging come in. 
    When you tell your communications software to capture a screen, it 
opens a file in your computer (usually in the same directory or folder 
used by the software) and "dumps" an image of whatever happens to be 
on your screen at the time. 
    Logging works a bit differently.  When you issue a logging 
command, you tell the software to open a file (again, usually in the 
same directory or folder as used by the software) and then give it a 
name. Then, until you turn off the logging command, everything that 
scrolls on your screen is copied into that file, sort of like 
recording on videotape.  This is useful for capturing long documents 
that scroll for several pages -- using screen capture, you would have 
to repeat the same command for each new screen. 
    Terminal emulation is a way for your computer to mimic, or 
emulate, the way other computers put information on the screen and 
accept commands from a keyboard.  In general, most systems on the Net 
use a system called VT100.  Fortunately, almost all communications 
programs now on the market support this system as well -- make sure 
yours does.
    You'll also have to know about protocols.  There are several 
different ways for computers to transmit characters.  Fortunately, 
there are only two protocols that you're likely to run across: 8-1-N 
(which stands for "8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity" -- yikes!) and 7-1-E 
(7 bits, 1 stop bit, even parity).  
     In general, Unix-based systems use 7-1-E, while MS-DOS-based 
systems use 8-1-N.  What if you don't know what kind of system you're 
connecting to?  Try one of the settings.  If you get what looks like 
gobbledygook when you connect, you may need the other setting.  
If so, you can either change the setting while connected, and then hit 
enter, or hang up and try again with the other setting.  It's also 
possible your modem and the modem at the other end can't agree on the 
right bps rate.  If changing the protocols doesn't work, try using 
another bps rate (but no faster than the one listed for your modem). 
Don't worry, remember, you can't break anything!  If something looks wrong, 
it probably is wrong.  Change your settings and try again.  Nothing is 
learned without trial, error and effort. 
     There are the basics.  Now on to the Net!


1.2 GO!

 
     Once, only people who studied or worked at an institution 
directly tied to the Net could connect to the world.  Today, though, 
an ever-growing number of "public-access" systems provide access for
everybody.  These systems can now be found in several states, and there 
are a couple of sites that can provide access across the country. 
     There are two basic kinds of these host systems.  The more common 
one is known as a UUCP site (UUCP being a common way to transfer 
information among computers using the Unix operating system) and 
offers access to international electronic mail and conferences.  
     However, recent years have seen the growth of more powerful sites 
that let you tap into the full power of the Net.  These Internet sites 
not only give you access to electronic mail and conferences but to 
such services as databases, libraries and huge file and program 
collections around the world.  They are also fast -- as soon as you 
finish writing a message, it gets zapped out to its destination.
     Some sites are run by for-profit companies; others by non-profit 
organizations.  Some of these public-access, or host, systems, are 
free of charge.  Others charge a monthly or yearly fee for unlimited 
access.  And a few charge by the hour. Systems that charge for access 
will usually let you sign up online with a credit card.  Some also let 
you set up a billing system. 
     But cost should be only one consideration in choosing a host 
system, especially if you live in an area with more than one provider.  
Most systems let you look around before you sign up.  What is the range 
of each of their services?  How easy is each to use? What kind of support or 
help can you get from the system administrators? 
     The last two questions are particularly important because many     
systems provide no user interface at all; when you connect, you are 
dumped right into the Unix operating system.  If you're already 
familiar with Unix, or you want to learn how to use it, these systems 
offer phenomenal power -- in addition to Net access, most also let you 
tap into the power of Unix to do everything from compiling your own 
programs to playing online games. 
     But if you don't want to have to learn Unix, there are other 
public-access systems that work through menus (just like the ones in 
restaurants; you are shown a list of choices and then you make your 
selection of what you want), or which provide a "user interface" that 
is easier to figure out than the ever cryptic Unix. 
     If you don't want or need access to the full range of Internet 
services, a UUCP site makes good financial sense.  They tend to charge 
less than commercial Internet providers, although their messages may 
not go out as quickly.
     Some systems also have their own unique local services, which can 
range from extensive conferences to large file libraries. 


1.3  PUBLIC-ACCESS INTERNET PROVIDERS

 
     When you have your communications program dial one of these host 
systems, one of two things will happen when you connect.  You'll 
either see a lot of gibberish on your screen, or you'll be asked to 
log in.  If you see gibberish, chances are you have to change your 
software's parameters (to 7-1-E or 8-1-N as the case may be).  Hang 
up, make the change and then dial in again.
     When you've connected, chances are you'll see something like 
this:
 
               Welcome to THE WORLD
               Public Access UNIX for the '90s
               Login as 'new' if you do not have an account
   
               login: 
 
     That last line is a prompt asking you to do something.  Since 
this is your first call, type
 
                new
 
and hit enter.  Often, when you're asked to type something by a host 
system, you'll be told what to type in quotation marks (for example,
'new').  Don't include the quotation marks.  Repeat: Don't 
include the quotation marks.
     What you see next depends on the system, but will generally 
consist of information about its costs and services (you might want to 
turn on your communication software's logging function, to save this 
information).  You'll likely be asked if you want to establish an 
account now or just look around the system.  
     You'll also likely be asked for your "user name."  This is not 
your full name, but a one-word name you want to use while online.  It 
can be any combination of letters or numbers, all in lower case.  Many
people use their first initial and last name (for example, 
"jdoe"); their first name and the first letter of their last name 
(for example, "johnd"); or their initials ("jxd").  Others use a 
nickname.  You might want to think about this for a second, because this 
user name will become part of your electronic-mail address (see chapter 
2 for more on that).  The one exception are the various Free-Net 
systems, all of which assign you a user name consisting of an arbitrary 
sequence of letters and numbers. 
     You are now on the Net.  Look around the system.  See if there 
are any help files for you to read.  If it's a menu-based host system, 
choose different options just to see what happens.  Remember: You can't 
break anything.  The more you play, the more comfortable you'll be. 
     What follows is a list of public-access Internet sites, which are 
computer systems that offer access to the Net.  All offer international 
e-mail and Usenet (international conferences).  In addition, they offer: 
   
     FTP: File-transfer protocol -- access to hundreds of file 
     libraries (everything from computer software to historical 
     documents to song lyrics).  You'll be able to transfer 
     these files from the Net to your own computer.
 
     Telnet: Access to databases, computerized library card 
     catalogs, weather reports and other information services, 
     as well as live, online games that let you compete with 
     players from around the world. 
 
        Additional services that may be offered include:
 
     WAIS:  Wide-area Information Server; a program that 
     can search dozens of databases in one search. 
 
     Gopher:  A program that gives you easy access to dozens 
     of other online databases and services by making 
     selections on a menu. You'll also be able to use these
     to copy text files and some programs to your mailbox.
 
     IRC:  Internet Relay Chat, a CB simulator that lets 
     you have live keyboard chats with people around the 
     world. 
 
     However, even on systems that do not provide these services 
directly, you will be able to use a number of them through telnet (see 
Chapter 6).   In the list that follows, 
systems that let you access services through menus are noted; otherwise 
assume that when you connect, you'll be dumped right into Unix (a.k.a. 
MS-DOS with a college degree). Several of these sites are available 
nationwide through national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet 
Network and SprintNet. 
     Please note that all listed charges are subject to change.  Many 
sites require new or prospective users to log on a particular way on 
their first call; this list provides the name you'll use in such cases.

1.4 IF YOUR TOWN HAS NO DIRECT ACCESS
 

     If you don't live in an area with a public-access site, you'll still 
be able to connect to the Net.  Several services offer access 
through national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet Network and 
SprintNet, which have dozens, even hundreds of local dial-in numbers across 
the country.  These include Holonet in Berkeley, Calf., Portal in 
Cupertino, Calf., the WELL in Sausalito, Calf., Dial 'N CERF in San Diego, 
Calf., the World in Brookline, Mass., and Michnet in Ann Arbor, Mich.  Dial 
'N CERF offers access through an 800 number.  Expect to pay from $2 to $12 
an hour to use these networks, above each provider's basic charges.  The 
exact amount depends on the network, time of day and type of modem you use.  
For more information, contact the above services. 
     Four other providers deliver Net access to users across the 
country:
     Delphi, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a consumer-oriented network 
much like CompuServe or America Online -- only it now offers 
subscribers access to Internet services. Delphi charges: $3 a month for 
Internet access, in addition to standard charges.  These are $10 a month 
for four hours of off-peak (non-working hours) access a month and $4 an 
hour for each additional hour or $20 for 20 hours of access a month and 
$1.80 an hour for each additional hour.  For more information, call (800) 
695-4005. 
     BIX (the Byte Information Exchange) offers FTP, Telnet and e-mail
access to the Internet as part of their basic service. Owned by the same 
company as Delphi, it also offers 20 hours of access a month for $20.  
For more information, call (800) 695-4775.              
     PSI, based in Reston, Va., provides nationwide access to Internet 
services through scores of local dial-in numbers to owners of IBM and 
compatible computers.  PSILink. which includes access to e-mail, 
Usenet and ftp, costs $29 a month, plus a one-time $19 registration 
fee.  Special software is required, but is available free from PSI. 
PSI's Global Dialup Service provides access to telnet for $39 a month 
plus a one-time $39 set-up fee.  For more information, call (800) 
82PSI82 or (703) 620-6651.
     NovX Systems Integration, based in Seattle, Washington, offers full 
Internet access through an 800 number reachable across the United States. 
There is a $24.95 setup fee, in addition to a monthly fee of $19.95 and a 
$10.5 hourly charge.  For more information, call (206) 447-0800. 




1.5  NET ORIGINS


     In the 1960s, researchers began experimenting with linking computers 
to each other and to people through telephone hook-ups, using funds from 
the U.S Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). 
     ARPA wanted to see if computers in different locations could be 
linked using a new technology known as packet switching. This technology, 
in which data meant for another location is broken up into little pieces, 
each with its own "forwarding address" had the promise of letting several 
users share just one communications line.  Just as important, from ARPA's 
viewpoint, was that this allowed for creation of networks that could 
automatically route data around downed circuits or computers.  ARPA's 
goal was not the creation of today's international computer-using 
community, but development of a data network that could survive a nuclear 
attack.
     Previous computer networking efforts had required a line between 
each computer on the network, sort of like a one-track train route. The 
packet system allowed for creation of a data highway, in which large 
numbers of vehicles could essentially share the same lane.  Each packet 
was given the computer equivalent of a map and a time stamp, so that it 
could be sent to the right destination, where it would then be 
reassembled into a message the computer or a human could use. 
     This system allowed computers to share data and the researchers to 
exchange electronic mail, or e-mail.  In itself, e-mail was something 
of a revolution, offering the ability to send detailed letters at the 
speed of a phone call. 
      As this system, known as ARPANet, grew, some enterprising college 
students (and one in high school) developed a way to use it to conduct 
online conferences.  These started as science-oriented discussions, but 
they soon branched out into virtually every other field, as people 
recognized the power of being able to "talk" to hundreds, or even 
thousands, of people around the country. 
     In the 1970s, ARPA helped support the development of rules, or 
protocols, for transferring data between different types of computer 
networks.  These "internet" (from "internetworking") protocols made it 
possible to develop the worldwide Net we have today that links all sorts 
of computers across national boundaries. By the close of the 1970s, links 
developed between ARPANet and counterparts in other countries.  The world 
was now tied together in a computer web.  
     In the 1980s, this network of networks, which became known 
collectively as the Internet, expanded at a phenomenal rate.  Hundreds, 
then thousands, of colleges, research companies and government agencies 
began to connect their computers to this worldwide Net.  Some 
enterprising hobbyists and companies unwilling to pay the high costs of 
Internet access (or unable to meet stringent government regulations for 
access) learned how to link their own systems to the Internet, even if 
"only" for e-mail and conferences.  Some of these systems began 
offering access to the public. Now anybody with a computer and modem -- 
and persistence -- could tap into the world. 
     In the 1990s, the Net continues to grow at exponential rates.  Some 
estimates are that the volume of messages transferred through the Net 
grows 20 percent a month.  In response, government and other users have 
tried in recent years to expand the Net itself.  Once, the main Net 
"backbone" in the U.S. moved data at 56,000 bits per second. That proved 
too slow for the ever increasing amounts of data being sent over it, and 
in recent years the maximum speed was increased to 1.5 million and then 
45 million bits per second. Even before the Net was able to reach that 
latter speed, however, Net experts were already figuring out ways to pump 
data at speeds of up to 2 billion bits per second -- fast enough to send 
the entire Encyclopedia Britannica across the country in just one or two 
seconds.  Another major change has been the development of commercial 
services that provide internetworking services at speeds comparable to 
those of the government system.  In fact, by mid-1994, the U.S. 
government will remove itself from any day-to-day control over the 
workings of the Net, as regional and national providers continue to 
expand.
 

1.6  HOW IT WORKS
 

     The worldwide Net is actually a complex web of smaller regional 
networks.  To understand it, picture a modern road network of trans-
continental superhighways connecting large cities.  From these large cities 
come smaller freeways and parkways to link together small towns, whose 
residents travel on slower, narrow residential ways.  
     The Net superhighway is the high-speed Internet.  Connected to 
this are computers that use a particular system of transferring data 
at high speeds.  In the U.S., the major Internet "backbone" 
theoretically can move data at rates of 45 million bits per second 
(compare this to the average home modem, which has a top speed of roughly 
9,600 to 14,400 bits per second).  
     Connected to the backbone computers are smaller networks serving 
particular geographic regions, which generally move data at speeds 
around 1.5 million bits per second.
     Feeding off these in turn are even smaller networks or individual 
computers.
     Unlike with commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy, there 
is no one central computer or computers running the Internet -- its 
resources are to be found among thousands of individual computers.  This 
is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.   The approach 
means it is virtually impossible for the entire Net to crash at once -- 
even if one computer shuts down, the rest of the network stays up.  The 
design also reduces the costs for an individual or organization to get 
onto the network.  But thousands of connected computers can also make it 
difficult to navigate the Net and find what you want -- especially as 
different computers may have different commands for plumbing their 
resources.  It is only recently that Net users have begun to develop the 
sorts of navigational tools and "maps" that will let neophytes get around 
without getting lost. 
     Nobody really knows how many computers and networks actually make 
up this Net.  Some estimates say there are now as many as 5,000 
networks connecting nearly 2 million computers and more than 15 million 
people around the world.  Whatever the actual numbers, however, it is 
clear they are only increasing.   
     The Net is more than just a technological marvel. It is human 
communication at its most fundamental level.  The pace may be a little 
quicker when the messages race around the world in a few seconds, but 
it's not much different from a large and interesting party. You'll see 
things in cyberspace that will make you laugh; you'll see things that 
will anger you.  You'll read silly little snippets and new ideas that 
make you think.  You'll make new friends and meet people you wish would 
just go away. 
     Major network providers continue to work on ways to make it 
easier for users of one network to communicate with those of another.  
Work is underway on a system for providing a universal "white pages" 
in which you could look up somebody's electronic-mail address, for 
example.  This connectivity trend will likely speed up in coming years 
as users begin to demand seamless network access, much as telephone 
users can now dial almost anywhere in the world without worrying about 
how many phone companies actually have to connect their calls. 
     And today, the links grow ever closer between the Internet and such 
commercial networks as CompuServe and Prodigy, whose users can now 
exchange electronic mail with their Internet friends.  Some commercial 
providers, such as Delphi and America Online, are working to bring their 
subscribers direct access to Internet services.
     And as it becomes easier to use, more and more people will join 
this worldwide community we call the Net. 
     Being connected to the Net takes more than just reading 
conferences and logging messages to your computer; it takes asking and 
answering questions, exchanging opinions -- getting involved. 
     If you choose to go forward, to use and contribute, you will become 
a citizen of Cyberspace.  If you're reading these words for the first 
time, this may seem like an amusing but unlikely notion -- that one 
could "inhabit" a place without physical space.  But put a mark beside 
these words.  Join the Net and actively participate for a year.  Then 
re-read this passage.  It will no longer seem so strange to be a 
"citizen of Cyberspace."  It will seem like the most natural thing in 
the world.   
     And that leads to another fundamental thing to remember:
 
                You can't break the Net!
 
     As you travel the Net, your computer may freeze, your screen may 
erupt into a mass of gibberish.  You may think you've just disabled a 
million-dollar computer somewhere -- or even your own personal 
computer.  Sooner or later, this feeling happens to everyone -- and 
likely more than once. But the Net and your computer are hardier than 
you think, so relax.  You can no more break the Net than you can the 
phone system.  If something goes wrong, try again.  If nothing at all 
happens, you can always disconnect.   If worse comes to worse, you can 
turn off your computer.  Then take a deep breath.  And dial right back 
in. Leave a note for the person who runs the computer to which you've 
connected to ask for advice.  Try it again. Persistence pays.  
     Stay and contribute.  The Net will be richer for it -- and so will 
you.        


1.7  WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 
 
     * Your computer connects with a public-access site and get gibberish 
on your screen.  
     If you are using parameters of 8-1-N, try 7-1-e (or vice-versa).  If 
that doesn't work, try another modem speed. 
     * You have your computer dial a public-access site, but nothing 
happens.  
     Check the phone number you typed in.  If correct, turn on your modem's 
speaker (on Hayes-compatible modems, you can usually do this by typing ATM1 
in your communications software's "terminal mode").  If the phone just 
rings and rings, the public-access site could be down for maintenance or 
due to a crash or some other problem.  If you get a "connect" message, but 
nothing else, try hitting enter or escape a couple of times.  
     * You try to log in, but after you type your password, nothing 
happens, or you get a "timed out" message followed by a disconnect.  
     Re-dial the number and try it again.
     * Always remember, if you have a problem that just doesn't go away,
ask! Ask your system administrator, ask a friend, but ask.  Somebody will
know what to do.


1.8  FYI


     The Net grows so fast that even the best guide to its resources 
would be somewhat outdated the day it was printed.  At the end of each 
chapter, however, you'll find FYI pointers to places on the Net where you 
can go for more information or to keep updated on new resources and 
services. 
     Peter Kaminski maintains a list of systems that provide public 
access to Internet services.  It's availble on the network itself, which 
obviously does you little good if you currently have no access, but which 
can prove invaluable should you move or want to find a new system.  Look 
for his "PDIAL" file in the alt.bbs.lists or news.answers newsgroups in 
Usenet (for information on accessing Usenet, see Chapter 3).
     Steven Levy's book, "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution," 
(Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1984). describes the early culture and ethos 
that ultimately resulted in the Internet and Usenet. 
     John Quarterman's "The Matrix: Computer Networks and Conferencing 
Systems Worldwide" (Digital Press, 1990) is an exhaustive look at 
computer networks and how they connect with each other. 
     You'll find numerous documents about the Internet, its history and
its resources in the pub/Net_info directory on the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's FTP server (see chapter 7 to decipher this).






Chapter 2: E-MAIL

 
 

2.1  THE BASICS


     Electronic mail, or e-mail, is your personal connection to the 
world of the Net. 
     All of the millions of people around the world who use the 
Net have their own e-mail addresses.  A growing number of "gateways" tie 
more and more people to the Net every day.  When you logged onto the host 
system you are now using, it automatically generated an address for you, 
as well. 
    The basic concepts behind e-mail parallel those of regular mail.  
You send mail to people at their particular addresses.  In turn, they 
write to you at your e-mail address.  You can subscribe to the 
electronic equivalent of magazines and newspapers. You might even get 
electronic junk mail.
    E-mail has two distinct advantages over regular mail.  The most 
obvious is speed. Instead of several days, your message can reach the 
other side of the world in hours, minutes or even seconds (depending on 
where you drop off your mail and the state of the connections between 
there and your recipient).  The other advantage is that once you master 
the basics, you'll be able to use e-mail to access databases and file 
libraries.  You'll see how to do this later, along with learning how to 
transfer program and data files through e-mail. 
    E-mail also has advantages over the telephone.  You send your 
message when it's convenient for you.  Your recipients respond at their 
convenience.  No more telephone tag.  And while a phone call across 
the country or around the world can quickly result in huge phone 
bills, e-mail lets you exchange vast amounts of mail for only a few 
pennies -- even if the other person is in New Zealand. 
    E-mail is your connection to help -- your Net lifeline.  The 
Net can sometimes seem a frustrating place!  No matter how hard you 
try, no matter where you look, you just might not be able to find the 
answer to whatever is causing you problems. But when you know how to 
use e-mail, help is often just a few keystrokes away: you can ask your 
system administrator or a friend for help in an e-mail message. 
    The quickest way to start learning e-mail is to send yourself a 
message.  Most public-access sites actually have several different types 
of mail systems, all of which let you both send and receive mail. We'll 
start with the simplest one, known, appropriately enough, as "mail," and 
then look at a couple of other interfaces. At your host system's command 
prompt, type: 
 
             mail username 
 
where username is the name you gave yourself when you first logged on.  
Hit enter.  The computer might respond with 
    
             subject: 
 
     Type 
 
             test 
 
or, actually, anything at all (but you'll have to hit enter before 
you get to the end of the screen). Hit enter. 
     The cursor will drop down a line. You can now begin writing the 
actual message. Type a sentence, again, anything at all.  And here's 
where you hit your first Unix frustration, one that will bug you 
repeatedly: you have to hit enter before you get to the very end of the 
line.  Just like typewriters, many Unix programs have no word-wrapping 
(although there are ways to get some Unix text processors, such as emacs, 
to word-wrap). 
     When done with your message, hit return. Now hit control-D (the 
control and the D keys at the same time).  This is a Unix command that 
tells the computer you're done writing and that it should close your 
"envelope" and mail it off (you could also hit enter once and then, on 
a blank line, type a period at the beginning of the line and hit enter 
again). 
     You've just sent your first e-mail message.  And because you're 
sending mail to yourself, rather than to someone somewhere else on the 
Net, your message has already arrived, as we'll see in a moment.
     If you had wanted, you could have even written your message on 
your own computer and then uploaded it into this electronic 
"envelope."  There are a couple of good reasons to do this with long 
or involved messages.  One is that once you hit enter at the end of a 
line in "mail" you can't readily fix any mistakes on that line (unless 
you use some special commands to call up a Unix text processor).  Also, 
if you are paying for access by the hour, uploading a prepared 
message can save you money.  Remember to save the document in ASCII or 
text format.  Uploading a document you've created in a word processor 
that uses special formatting commands (which these days means many 
programs) will cause strange effects.
     When you get that blank line after the subject line, upload the 
message using the ASCII protocol.  Or you can copy and paste the text, 
if your software allows that. When done, hit control-D as above. 
     Now you have mail waiting for you.  Normally, when you log on, 
your public-access site will tell you whether you have new mail 
waiting.  To open your mailbox and see your waiting mail, type 
                 
          mail 
 
and hit enter. 
     When the host system sees "mail" without a name after it, it 
knows you want to look in your mailbox rather than send a message. 
Your screen, on a plain-vanilla Unix system will display:
 
         Mail version SMI 4.0 Mon Apr 24 18:34:15 PDT 1989  Type ? for help. 
         "/usr/spool/mail/adamg": 1 message 1 new 1 unread 
  
         >N 1 adamg              Sat Jan 15 20:04   12/290   test 
   
     Ignore the first line; it's just computerese of value only to the 
people who run your system. You can type a question mark and hit 
return, but unless you're familiar with Unix, most of what you'll see 
won't make much sense at this point.  
     The second line tells you the directory on the host system where 
your mail messages are put, which again, is not something you'll likely 
need to know.  The second line also tells you how many messages are in your 
mailbox, how many have come in since the last time you looked and how 
many messages you haven't read yet. 
     It's the third line that is of real interest -- it tells you who 
the message is from, when it arrived, how many lines and characters 
it takes up, and what the subject is.  The "N" means it is a new 
message -- it arrived after the last time you looked in your mailbox.  
Hit enter. And there's your message -- only now it's a lot 
longer than what you wrote! 
 
        Message 1: 
        From adamg Jan 15 20:04:55 1994
        Received: by eff.org id AA28949 
        (5.65c/IDA-1.4.4/pen-ident for adamg); Sat, 15 Jan 1994 20:04:55 -0400  
        (ident-sender: adamg@eff.org) 
        Date: Sat, 15 Jan 1994 21:34:55 -0400 
        From: Adam Gaffin <adamg> 
        Message-Id: <199204270134.AA28949@eff.org> 
        To: adamg 
        Subject: test 
        Status: R 
 
        This is only a test! 
 
     Whoa! What is all that stuff? It's your message with a postmark 
gone mad.  Just as the postal service puts its marks on every piece of 
mail it handles, so do Net postal systems.  Only it's called a 
"header" instead of a postmark. Each system that handles or routes 
your mail puts its stamp on it.  Since many messages go through a 
number of systems on their way to you, you will often get messages 
with headers that seem to go on forever.  Among other things, a header 
will tell you exactly when a message was sent and received (even the 
difference between your local time and Greenwich Mean Time -- as at the end 
of line 4 above). 
     If this had been a long message, it would just keep scrolling 
across and down your screen -- unless the people who run your public-
access site have set it up to pause every 24 lines.  One way to deal 
with a message that doesn't stop is to use your telecommunication 
software's logging or text-buffer function.  Start it before you hit 
the number of the message you want to see.  Your computer will ask you 
what you want to call the file you're about to create. After you name 
the file and hit enter, type the number of the message you want to see 
and hit enter.  When the message finishes scrolling, turn off the 
text-buffer function. The message is now saved in your computer.  
This way, you can read the message while not connected to the Net 
(which can save you money if you're paying by the hour) and write a 
reply offline. 
     But in the meantime, now what?  You can respond to the message, 
delete it or save it.  To respond, type a lowercase r and hit 
enter.  You'll get something like this: 
 
          To: adamg 
          Subject: Re:  test 
 
     Note that this time, you don't have to enter a user name.  The 
computer takes it from the message you're replying to and 
automatically addresses your message to its sender. The computer also 
automatically inserts a subject line, by adding "Re:" to the original 
subject.  From here, it's just like writing a new message. But say you 
change your mind and decide not to reply after all. How do you get out 
of the message? Hit control-C once. You'll get this: 
 
          (Interrupt -- one more to kill letter) 
 
If you hit control-C once more, the message will disappear and you'll 
get back to your mail's command line. 
     Now, if you type a lowercase d and then hit enter, you'll 
delete the original message.  Type a lowercase q to exit your 
mailbox.  
     If you type a q without first hitting d, your message is 
transferred to a file called mbox.  This file is where all read, but 
un-deleted messages go.  If you want to leave it in your mailbox for 
now, type a lowercase x and hit enter.  This gets you out of mail 
without making any changes. 
     The mbox file works a lot like your mailbox.  To access it, 
type 
   
           mail -f mbox 
 
at your host system's command line and hit enter.  
     You'll get a menu identical to the one in your mailbox from which 
you can read these old messages, delete them or respond to them.  It's 
probably a good idea to clear out your mailbox and mbox file from 
time to time, if only to keep them uncluttered. 
    Are there any drawbacks to e-mail?  There are a few.  One is that 
people seem more willing to fly off the handle electronically than in 
person, or over the phone.  Maybe it's because it's so easy to hit r
and reply to a message without pausing and reflecting a moment.  
That's why we have smileys (see section 2.4)!  There's no online 
equivalent yet of a return receipt: chances are your message got to where 
it's going, but there's no absolute way for you to know for sure unless 
you get a reply from the other person.                
     So now you're ready to send e-mail to other people on the Net.  
Of course, you need somebody's address to send them mail.  How do you 
get it?  
     Alas, the simplest answer is not what you'd call the most 
elegant: you call them up on the phone or write them a letter on paper 
and ask them.  Residents of the electronic frontier are only beginning 
to develop the equivalent of phone books, and the ones that exist 
today are far from complete (still, later on, in Chapter 6, we'll show 
you how to use some of these directories). 
     Eventually, you'll start corresponding with people, which means 
you'll want to know how to address mail to them.  It's vital to know 
how to do this, because the smallest mistake -- using a comma when you 
should have used a period, for instance, can bounce the message back 
to you, undelivered.  In this sense, Net addresses are like phone 
numbers: one wrong digit and you get the wrong person.  Fortunately, 
most net addresses now adhere to a relatively easy-to-understand 
system. 
     Earlier, you sent yourself a mail message using just your user-
name.  This was sort of like making a local phone call -- you didn't 
have to dial a 1 or an area code.  This also works for mail to anybody 
else who has an account on the same system as you. 
     Sending mail outside of your system, though, will require the use 
of the Net equivalent of area codes, called "domains." A basic Net 
address will look something like this: 
 
              tomg@world.std.com 
 
     Tomg is somebody's user ID, and he is at (hence the @ sign) a site 
(or in Internetese, a "domain") known as std.com.  Large organizations 
often have more than one computer linked to the Internet; in this case, 
the name of the particular machine is world (you will quickly notice 
that, like boat owners, Internet computer owners always name their 
machines). 
     Domains tell you the name of the organization that runs a given 
e-mail site and what kind of site it is or, if it's not in the U.S., 
what country it's located in.  Large organizations may have more than 
one computer or gateway tied to the Internet, so you'll often see a 
two-part domain name; and sometimes even three- or four-part domain 
names. 
     In general, American addresses end in an organizational suffix, 
such as ".edu," which means the site is at a college or university. 
Other American suffixes include: 
          
          .com for businesses 
          .org for non-profit organizations 
          .gov and .mil for government and military agencies 
          .net for companies or organizations that run large networks.  
 
     Sites in the rest of the world tend to use a two-letter code that 
represents their country.  Most make sense, such as .ca for Canadian 
sites, but there are a couple of seemingly odd ones.  Swiss sites end 
in .ch, while South African ones end in .za.  Some U.S. sites have 
followed this international convention (such as well.sf.ca.us).
    You'll notice that the above addresses are all in lower-case.  
Unlike almost everything else having anything at all to do with Unix, 
most Net mailing systems don't care about case, so you generally don't 
have to worry about capitalizing e-mail addresses.  Alas, there are a few 
exceptions -- some public-access sites do allow for capital letters in 
user names.  When in doubt, ask the person you want to write to, or let 
her send you a message first (recall how a person's e-mail address is 
usually found on the top of her message). The domain name, the part of the 
address after the @ sign, never has to be capitalized.               
     It's all a fairly simple system that works very well, except, 
again, it's vital to get the address exactly right -- just as you have 
to dial a phone number exactly right.  Send a message to tomg@unm.edu 
(which is the University of New Mexico) when you meant to send it to 
tomg@umn.edu (the University of Minnesota), and your letter will either 
bounce back to you undelivered, or go to the wrong person.
     If your message is bounced back to you as undeliverable, you'll 
get an ominous looking-message from MAILER-DAEMON (actually a rather 
benign Unix program that exists to handle mail), with an evil-looking 
header followed by the text of your message. Sometimes, you can tell 
what went wrong by looking at the first few lines of the bounced 
message.  Besides an incorrect address, it's possible your host system 
does not have the other site in the "map" it maintains of other host 
systems. Or you could be trying to send mail to another network, such 
as Bitnet or CompuServe, that has special addressing requirements.
    Sometimes, figuring all this out can prove highly frustrating.  
But remember the prime Net commandment: Ask.  Send a message to your 
system administrator.  He or she might be able to help decipher the 
problem. 
    There is one kind of address that may give your host system 
particular problems.  There are two main ways that Unix systems 
exchange mail.  One is known as UUCP and started out with a different 
addressing system than the rest of the Net.  Most UUCP systems have 
since switched over to the standard Net addressing system, but a few 
traditional sites still cling to their original type, which tends to 
have lots of exclamation points in it, like this: 
 
               uunet!somesite!othersite!mybuddy 
 
     The problem for many host sites is that exclamation points (also 
known as "bangs") now mean something special in the more common systems 
or "shells" used to operate many Unix computers. This means that 
addressing mail to such a site (or even responding to a message you 
received from one) could confuse the poor computer to no end and your 
message never gets sent out. If that happens, try putting backslashes in 
front of each exclamation point, so that you get an address that looks 
like this: 
          
               uunet\!somesite\!othersite\!mybuddy 
 
Note that this means you may not be able to respond to such a message 
by typing a lowercase r  -- you may get an error message and you'll 
have to create a brand-new message. 
    If you want to get a taste of what's possible through e-mail,
start an e-mail message to
 
              almanac@oes.orst.edu
 
Leave the "subject:" line blank.  As a message, write this:
 
              send quote
 
Or, if you're feeling a little down, write this instead:
 
              send moral-support
 
     In either case, you will get back a message within a few seconds to 
a few hours (depending on the state of your host system's Internet 
connection).  If you simply asked for a quote, you'll get back a 
fortune-cookie-like saying.  If you asked for moral support, you'll also 
get back a fortune-cookie-like saying, only supposedly more uplifting.
      This particular "mail server" is run by Oregon State University. 
Its main purpose is actually to provide a way to distribute agricultural 
information via e-mail.  If you'd like to find out how to use the 
server's full range of services, send a message to its address with this 
line in it: 
 
              send help
 
You'll quickly get back a lengthy document detailing just what's 
available and how to get it.
     Feeling opinionated?  Want to give the President of the United 
States a piece of your mind?  Send a message to president@whitehouse.gov.  
Or if the vice president will do, write vice-president@whitehouse.gov. 
     The "mail" program is actually a very powerful one and a Netwide 
standard, at least on Unix computers.  But it can be hard to figure 
out -- you can type a question mark to get a list of commands, but 
these may be of limited use unless you're already familiar with Unix. 
Fortunately, there are a couple of other mail programs that are easier 
to use. 


2.2  ELM -- A BETTER WAY 

 
     Elm is a combination mailbox and letter-writing system that uses 
menus to help you navigate through mail.  Most Unix-based host systems 
now have it online. To use it, type 
  
                elm 
 
and hit enter.  You'll get a menu of your waiting mail, along with a 
list of commands you can execute, that will look something like this:

   You can use any of the following commands by pressing the first character;  
 d)elete or u)ndelete mail,  m)ail a message,  r)eply or f)orward mail,  q)uit 
    To read a message, press <return>.  j = move down, k = move up, ? = help   
 
     Each line shows the date you received the message, who sent it, 
how many lines long the message is, and the message's subject.
     If you are using VT100 emulation, you can move up and down the 
menu with your up and down arrow keys.  Otherwise, type the line number 
of the message you want to read or delete and hit enter.
     When you read a message, it pauses every 24 lines, instead of 
scrolling until it's done.  Hit the space bar to read the next page.  
You can type a lowercase r to reply or a lower-case q or i 
to get back to the menu (the I stands for "index").  
     At the main menu, hitting a lowercase m followed by enter 
will let you start a message.  To delete a message, type a lower-case 
d.  You can do this while reading the message.  Or, if you are in 
the menu, move the cursor to the message's line and then hit d. 
     When you're done with elm, type a lower-case q.  The program 
will ask if you really want to delete the messages you marked. Then, 
it will ask you if you want to move any messages you've read but 
haven't marked for deletion to a "received" file.  For now, hit your n
key.  
     Elm has a major disadvantage for the beginner. The default text 
editor it generally calls up when you hit your r or m key is often a 
program called emacs. Unixoids swear by emacs, but everybody else almost 
always finds it impossible.  Unfortunately, you can't always get away 
from it (or vi, another text editor often found on Unix systems), so 
later on we'll talk about some basic commands that will keep you from 
going totally nuts. 
     If you want to save a message to your own computer, hit s, either 
within the message or with your cursor on the message entry in the elm 
menu.  A filename will pop up.  If you do not like it, type a new name 
(you won't have to backspace).  Hit enter, and the message will be saved 
with that file name in your "home directory" on your host system.  After 
you exit elm, you can now download it (ask your system administrator for 
specifics on how to download -- and upload -- such files).

 
2.3  PINE -- AN EVEN BETTER WAY

 
     Pine is based on elm but includes a number of improvements that 
make it an ideal mail system for beginners.   Like elm, pine starts 
you with a menu.  It also has an "address book" feature that is handy 
for people with long or complex e-mail addresses. Hitting A at the 
main menu puts you in the address book, where you can type in the 
person's first name (or nickname) followed by her address. Then, when 
you want to send that person a message, you only have to type in her 
first name or nickname, and pine automatically inserts her actual 
address. The address book also lets you set up a mailing list.  This 
feature allows you to send the same message to a number of people at 
once. 
     What really sets pine apart is its built-in text editor, 
which looks and feels a lot more like word-processing programs 
available for MS-DOS and Macintosh users.  Not only does it have 
word wrap (a revolutionary concept if ever there was one), it also has a 
spell-checker and a search command. Best of all, all of the commands 
you need are listed in a two-line mini-menu at the bottom of each 
screen.  The commands look like this: 
 
               ^W Where is 
 
The little caret is a synonym for the key marked "control" on your 
keyboard.  To find where a particular word is in your document, you'd 
hit your control key and your W key at the same time, which would bring 
up a prompt asking you for the word to look for. 
     Some of pine's commands are a tad peculiar (control-V for "page 
down" for example), which comes from being based on a variant of 
emacs (which is utterly peculiar).  But again, all of the commands you 
need are listed on that two-line mini-menu, so it shouldn't take you 
more than a couple of seconds to find the right one. 
     To use pine, type 
 
               pine 
 
at the command line and hit enter.  It's a relatively new program, so 
some systems may not yet have it online.  But it's so easy to use, you 
should probably send e-mail to your system administrator urging him to 
get it! 
 
 
2.4  SMILEYS
 
 
    When you're involved in an online discussion, you can't see the 
smiles or shrugs that the other person might make in a live 
conversation to show he's only kidding.  But online, there's no body 
language. So what you might think is funny, somebody else might take as 
an insult.  To try to keep such misunderstandings from erupting into 
bitter disputes, we have smileys.  Tilt your head to the left and look at 
the following sideways. :-).  Or simply :).  This is your basic "smiley."
Use it to indicate people should not take that comment you just made as 
seriously as they might otherwise.  You make a smiley by typing a colon, 
a hyphen and a right parenthetical bracket. Some people prefer using the 
word "grin," usually in this form: 
 
          <grin>   
 
Sometimes, though, you'll see it as *grin* or even just <g> for short. 
 
Some other smileys include: 
 
          ;-)      Wink; 
          :-(      Frown; 
          :-O      Surprise; 
          8-)      Wearing glasses; 
          =|:-)=   Abe Lincoln. 
    
         OK, so maybe the last two are a little bogus :-).
 

2.5  SENDING E-MAIL TO OTHER NETWORKS
 
 
     There are a number of computer networks that are not directly 
part of the Net, but which are now connected through "gateways" that 
allow the passing of e-mail.  Here's a list of some of the larger 
networks, how to send mail to them and how their users can send mail to 
you: 
 
America Online 
 
     Remove any spaces from a user's name and append "aol.com," to get 
 
               user@aol.com 
 
     America Online users who want to send mail to you need only put 
your Net address in the "to:" field before composing a message. 
 
 
ATTMail 
 
     Address your message to user@attmail.com. 
   
     From ATTMail, a user would send mail to you in this form: 
 
               internet!domain!user 
 
     So if your address were nancyr@world.std.com, your correspondent 
would send a message to you at 
 
               internet!world.std.com!nancyr 
 
 
Bitnet 
     
     Users of Bitnet (and NetNorth in Canada and EARN in Europe) often 
have addresses in this form: IZZY@INDVMS.  If you're lucky, all you'll 
have to do to mail to that address is add "bitnet" at the end, to get 
izzy@indvms.bitnet.  Sometimes, however, mail to such an address will 
bounce back to you, because Bitnet addresses do not always translate 
well into an Internet form.  If this happens, you can send mail 
through one of two Internet/Bitnet gateways. First, change the @ in 
the address to a %, so that you get username%site.bitnet.  Then add 
either @vm.marist.edu or @cunyvm.cuny.edu, so that, with the above 
example, you would get izzy%indyvms.bitnet@vm.marist.edu or 
izzy%indvyvms.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu 
      Bitnet users have it a little easier: They can usually send mail 
directly to your e-mail address without fooling around with it at all.  
So send them your address and they should be OK. 
 
 
CompuServe 
 
     CompuServe users have numerical addresses in this form: 
73727,545. To send mail to a CompuServe user, change the comma to a 
period and add "@compuserve.com"; for example: 
73727.545@compuserve.com. 
     Note that some CompuServe users must pay extra to receive mail from 
the Internet.
     If you know CompuServe users who want to send you mail, tell them 
to GO MAIL and create a mail message. In the address area, instead of 
typing in a CompuServe number, have them type your address in this 
form: 
 
               >INTERNET:YourID@YourAddress. 
 
     For example, >INTERNET:adamg@world.std.com.  Note that both the 
">" and the ":" are required. 
 
 
Delphi
 
     To send mail to a Delphi user, the form is username@delphi.com.
 
     
Fidonet 
 
    To send mail to people using a Fidonet BBS, you need the name 
they use to log onto that system and its "node number.''  Fidonet node 
numbers or addresses consist of three numbers, in this form: 
1:322/190.  The first number tells which of several broad geographic 
zones the BBS is in (1 represents the U.S. and Canada, 2 Europe and 
Israel, 3 Pacific Asia, 4 South America).  The second number 
represents the BBS's network, while the final number is the BBS's 
"FidoNode'' number in that network. If your correspondent only gives 
you two numbers (for example, 322/190), it means the system is in zone 
1.   
     Now comes the tricky part. You have to reverse the numbers and 
add to them the letters f, n and z (which stand for 
"FidoNode,''"network,'' and "zone'). For example, the address above 
would become 
 
               f190.n322.z1. 
 
     Now add "fidonet.org'' at the end, to get 
f190.n322.z1.fidonet.org. Then add "FirstName.LastName@', to get 
 
               FirstName.LastName@f190.n322.z1.fidonet.org
 
Note the period between the first and last names. Also, some countries 
now have their own Fidonet "backbone" systems, which might affect 
addressing.  For example, were the above address in Germany, you would 
end it with "fido.de" instead of "fidonet.org."
     Whew! 
     The reverse process is totally different. First, the person has 
to have access to his or her BBS's "net mail" area and know the 
Fidonet address of his or her local Fidonet/UUCP gateway (often their 
system operator will know it).  Your Fidonet correspondent should 
address a net-mail message to UUCP (not your name) in the "to:" field.  
In the node-number field, they should type in the node number of the 
Fidonet/UUCP gateway (if the gateway system is in the same regional 
network as their system, they need only type the last number, for 
example, 390 instead of 322/390).  Then, the first line of the message 
has to be your Internet address, followed by a blank line.  After 
that, the person can write the message and send it.  
     Because of the way Fidonet moves mail, it could take a day or two 
for a message to be delivered in either direction.  Also, because many 
Fidonet systems are run as hobbies, it is considered good form to ask 
the gateway sysop's permission if you intend to pass large amounts of 
mail back and forth. Messages of a commercial nature are strictly 
forbidden (even if it's something the other person asked for). Also, 
consider it very likely that somebody other than the recipient will 
read your messages. 
 
 
GEnie  
 
      To send mail to a GEnie user, add "@genie.com" to the end
of the GEnie user name, for example: walt@genie.com. 
 
MCIMail 
 
      To send mail to somebody with an MCIMail account, add 
"@mcimail.com to the end of their name or numerical address. For 
example: 
       
                555-1212@mcimail.com 
 
      or 
     
                jsmith@mcimail.com 
 
     Note that if there is more than one MCIMail subscriber with that 
name, you will get a mail message back from MCI giving you their names 
and numerical addresses. You'll then have to figure out which one you 
want and re-send the message. 
 
     From MCI, a user would type 
 
                Your Name (EMS) 
 
at the "To:" prompt.  At the EMS prompt, he or she would type 
 
                internet 
 
followed by your Net address at the "Mbx:" prompt. 
 
 
Peacenet 
 
     To send mail to a Peacenet user, use this form: 
 
                username@igc.org 
 
     Peacenet subscribers can use your regular address to send you 
mail. 
 
 
Prodigy 
 
     UserID@prodigy.com.  Note that Prodigy users must pay extra for 
Internet e-mail.


2.6  SEVEN UNIX COMMANDS YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT:

 
     If you connect to the Net through a Unix system, eventually you'll 
have to come to terms with Unix.  For better or worse, most Unix systems do 
NOT shield you from their inner workings -- if you want to copy a Usenet 
posting to a file, for example, you'll have to use some Unix commands if 
you ever want to do anything with that file.
     Like MS-DOS, Unix is an operating system - it tells the computer how 
to do things.  Now while Unix may have a reputation as being even more 
complex than MS-DOS, in most cases, a few basic, and simple, commands 
should be all you'll ever need. 
     If your own computer uses MS-DOS or PC-DOS, the basic concepts will 
seem very familiar -- but watch out for the cd command, which works 
differently enough from the similarly named DOS command that it will drive 
you crazy.  Also, unlike MS-DOS, Unix is case sensitive -- if you type 
commands or directory names in the wrong case, you'll get an error message. 
     If you're used to working on a Mac, you'll have to remember that Unix 
stores files in "directories" rather than "folders."  Unix directories are 
organized like branches on a tree. At the bottom is the "root" directory, 
with sub-directories branching off that (and sub-directories in turn can 
have sub-directories). The Mac equivalent of a Unix sub-directory is a 
folder within another folder. 
 
cat           Equivalent to the MS-DOS "type" command.  To pause a file 
              every screen, type
 
                        cat file |more
 
              where "file" is the name of the file you want to see.  
              Hitting control-C will stop the display.  Alternately,
              you could type
                     
                        more file
              
              to achieve the same result. You can also use cat for 
              writing or uploading text files to your name or home 
              directory (similar to the MS-DOS "copy con" command).  If 
              you type
 
                        cat>test
 
              you start a file called "test."  You can either write 
              something simple (no editing once you've finished a line and
              you have to hit return at the end of each line) or upload
              something into that file using your communications software's
              ASCII protocol).  To close the file, hit control-D.
 
cd            The "change directory" command.  To change from your present 
              directory to another, type
 
                        cd directory
 
              and hit enter. Unlike MS-DOS, which uses a \ to denote sub-
              directories (for example: \stuff\text), Unix uses a / (for 
              example: /stuff/text).  So to change from your present 
              directory to the stuff/text sub-directory,  you would type 
                
                        cd stuff/text
 
              and then hit enter. As in MS-DOS, you do not need the first 
              backslash if the subdirectory comes off the directory you're 
              already in.  To move back up a directory tree, you would type
                
                        cd ..
 
              followed by enter. Note the space between the cd and the two 
              periods -- this is where MS-DOS users will really go nuts.
 
cp            Copies a file. The syntax is
 
                        cp file1 file2
 
              which would copy file1 to file2 (or overwrite file2 with 
              file1).
 
ls            This command, when followed by enter, tells you what's in the 
              directory, similar to the DOS dir command, except in 
              alphabetical order.
       
                        ls | more 
 
              will stop the listing every 24 lines -- handy if there are a 
              lot of things in the directory. The basic ls command does not 
              list "hidden" files, such as the .login file that controls 
              how your system interacts with Unix. To see these files, type 
 
                        ls -a      or    ls -a | more
 
              ls -l will tell you the size of each file in bytes and tell 
              you when each was created or modified. 
 
mv            Similar to the MS-DOS rename command.
 
                        mv file1 file2
 
              will rename file1 as file2, The command can 
              also be used to move files between directories.
 
                        mv file1 News
 
              would move file1 to your News directory.
 
rm            Deletes a file.  Type
 
                        rm filename
 
              and hit enter (but beware: when you hit enter, it's gone for
              good).
               
     WILDCARDS:  When searching for, copying or deleting files, you can 
use "wildcards" if you are not sure of the file's exact name. 
 
              ls man*
 
 
would find the following files:
 
              manual, manual.txt, man-o-man.
 
Use a question mark when you're sure about all but one or two characters.  
For example, 
 
              ls man?
 
would find a file called mane, but not one called manual.
 

2.7  WHEN THINGS GO WRONG                  
 

     * You send a message but get back an ominous looking message from 
MAILER-DAEMON containing up to several dozen lines of computerese 
followed by your message.  
     Somewhere in those lines you can often find a clue to what went 
wrong.  You might have made a mistake in spelling the e-mail address.  
The site to which you're sending mail might have been down for 
maintenance or a problem. You may have used the wrong "translation" for 
mail to a non-Internet network. 
     * You call up your host system's text editor to write a message or 
reply to one and can't seem to get out.  
     If it's emacs, try control-X, control-C (in other words, hit your 
control key and your X key at the same time, followed by control and C).  
If worse comes to worse, you can hang up. 
     * In elm, you accidentally hit the D key for a message you want to 
save.  
     Type the number of the message, hit enter and then U, which will 
"un-delete" the message.  This works only before you exit Elm; once you 
quit, the message is gone. 
     * You try to upload an ASCII message you've written on your own
computer into a message you're preparing in Elm or Pine and you get a
lot of left brackets, capital Ms, Ks and Ls and some funny-looking
characters.  
     Believe it or not, your message will actually wind up looking fine; 
all that garbage is temporary and reflects the problems some Unix text 
processors have with ASCII uploads.  But it will take much longer for 
your upload to finish.  One way to deal with this is to call up the 
simple mail program, which will not produce any weird characters when you 
upload a text file into a message.  Another way (which is better if your 
prepared message is a response to somebody's mail), is to create a text 
file on your host system with cat, for example, 
 
          cat>file
 
and then upload your text into that.  Then, in elm or pine, you can 
insert the message with a simple command (control-R in pine, for 
example); only this time you won't see all that extraneous stuff. 
     *  You haven't cleared out your Elm mailbox in awhile, and you 
accidentally hit "y" when you meant to hit "n" (or vice-versa) when 
exiting and now all your messages have disappeared.  Look in your News 
directory (at the command line, type: cd News) for a file called 
recieved.  Those are all your messages.  Unfortunately, there's no way to 
get them back into your Elm mailbox -- you'll have to download the file 
or read it online.






Chapter 3: USENET I
 
 


3.1  THE GLOBAL WATERING HOLE


     Imagine a conversation carried out over a period of hours and days, 
as if people were leaving messages and responses on a bulletin board.  Or 
imagine the electronic equivalent of a radio talk show where everybody 
can put their two cents in and no one is ever on hold. 
     Unlike e-mail, which is usually "one-to-one,"  Usenet is "many-to-
many." Usenet is the international meeting place, where people gather to 
meet their friends, discuss the day's events, keep up with computer 
trends or talk about whatever's on their mind.  Jumping into a Usenet 
discussion can be a liberating experience.  Nobody knows what you look or 
sound like, how old you are, what your background is.  You're judged 
solely on your words, your ability to make a point. 
     To many people, Usenet IS the Net. In fact, it is often confused 
with Internet.  But it is a totally separate system. All Internet sites 
CAN carry Usenet, but so do many non-Internet sites, from sophisticated 
Unix machines to old XT clones and Apple IIs. 
     Technically, Usenet messages are shipped around the world, from 
host system to host system, using one of several specific Net 
protocols.  Your host system stores all of its Usenet messages in one 
place, which everybody with an account on the system can access. That 
way, no matter how many people actually read a given message, each 
host system has to store only one copy of it. Many host systems "talk" 
with several others regularly in case one or another of their links goes 
down for some reason.  When two host systems connect, they basically 
compare notes on which Usenet messages they already have.  Any that one 
is missing the other then transmits, and vice-versa.  Because they are 
computers, they don't mind running through thousands, even millions, of 
these comparisons every day. 
     Yes, millions.  For Usenet is huge.  Every day, Usenet users 
pump upwards of 40 million characters a day into the system -- roughly 
the equivalent of volumes A-G of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Obviously, 
nobody could possibly keep up with this immense flow of messages.  Let's 
look at how to find conferences and discussions of interest to you. 
     The basic building block of Usenet is the newsgroup, which is a 
collection of messages with a related theme (on other networks, these 
would be called conferences, forums, bboards or special-interest 
groups).  There are now more than 5,000 of these newsgroups, in several 
diferent languages, covering everything from art to zoology, from 
science fiction to South Africa.
     Some public-access systems, typically the ones that work through 
menus, try to make it easier by dividing Usenet into several broad 
categories.  Choose one of those and you're given a list of newsgroups in 
that category.  Then select the newsgroup you're interested in and start 
reading. 
     Other systems let you compile your own "reading list" so that you 
only see messages in conferences you want.  In both cases, conferences 
are arranged in a particular hierarchy devised in the early 1980s.  
Newsgroup names start with one of a series of broad topic names.  For 
example, newsgroups beginning with "comp." are about particular computer-
related topics.  These broad topics are followed by a series of more 
focused topics (so that "comp.unix" groups are limited to discussion 
about Unix).  The main hierarchies are: 
 
             bionet          Research biology
             bit.listserv    Conferences originating as Bitnet mailing lists
             biz             Business
             comp            Computers and related subjects
             misc            Discussions that don't fit anywhere else
             news            News about Usenet itself
             rec             Hobbies, games and recreation
             sci             Science other than research biology
             soc             "Social" groups, often ethnically related
             talk            Politics and related topics
             alt             Controversial or unusual topics; not
                             carried by all sites
 
     In addition, many host systems carry newsgroups for a particular 
city, state or region.  For example, ne.housing is a newsgroup where 
New Englanders look for apartments.  A growing number also carry K12 
newsgroups, which are aimed at elementary and secondary teachers and 
students.  And a number of sites carry clari newsgroups, which is 
actually a commercial service consisting of wire-service stories and 
a unique online computer news service (more on this in chapter 10). 


3.2 NAVIGATING USENET WITH nn


     How do you dive right in?  As mentioned, on some systems, it's all 
done through menus -- you just keep choosing from a list of choices until 
you get to the newsgroup you want and then hit the "read" command.  On 
Unix systems, however, you will have to use a "newsreader" program.  Two 
of the more common ones are known as rn (for "read news") and nn (for "no 
news" -- because it's supposed to be simpler to use). 
     For beginners, nn may be the better choice because it works with
menus -- you get a list of articles in a given newsgroup and then you 
choose which ones you want to see.  To try it out, connect to your host 
system and, at the command line, type 
 
               nn news.announce.newusers
 
and hit enter.  After a few seconds, you should see something like 
this:
 
Newsgroup: news.announce.newusers                     Articles: 22 of 22/1 NEW

Explanatory postings for new users. (Moderated)                                
 
     Obviously, this is a good newsgroup to begin your exploration of 
Usenet!  Here's what all this means:  The first letter on each line is 
the letter you type to read that particular "article" (it makes sense 
that a "newsgroup" would have "articles").  Next comes the name of the 
person who wrote that article, followed by its length, in lines, and 
what the article is about. At the bottom, you see the local time at your 
access site, what you're doing right now (i.e., SELECTing articles), 
which key to hit for some help (the ? key) and how many of the articles 
in the newsgroup you can see on this screen. The "(moderated)" means the 
newsgroup has a "moderator" who is the only one who can directly post 
messages to it.  This is generally limited to groups such as this, which 
contain articles of basic information, or for digests, which are 
basically online magazines (more on them in a bit). 
      Say you're particularly interested in what "Emily Postnews" has to 
say about proper etiquette on Usenet. Hit your c key (lower case!), and 
the line will light up.  If you want to read something else, hit the key 
that corresponds to it.  And if you want to see what's on the next page 
of articles, hit return or your space bar.
     But you're impatient to get going, and you want to read that 
article now.  The command for that in nn is a capital Z.  Hit it and 
you'll see something like this:

     The first few lines are the message's header, similar to the header 
you get in e-mail messages.  Then comes the beginning of the message.  
The last line tells you the time again, the newsgroup name (or part of 
it, anyway), the position in your message stack that this message 
occupies, how to get help, and how much of the message is on screen.  If 
you want to keep reading this message, just hit your space bar (not your 
enter key!) for the next screen and so on until done. When done, you'll 
be returned to the newsgroup menu.  For now hit Q (upper case this time), 
which quits you out of nn and returns you to your host system's command 
line. 
     To get a look at another interesting newsgroup, type
 
                nn comp.risks
 
and hit enter.  This newsgroup is another moderated group, this time a 
digest of all the funny and frightening ways computers and the people 
who run and use them can go wrong.  Again, you read articles by 
selecting their letters.  If you're in the middle of an article and 
decide you want to go onto the next one, hit your n key.
     Now it's time to look for some newsgroups that might be of 
particular interest to you.  Unix host systems that have nn use a program 
called nngrep (ever get the feeling Unix was not entirely written in 
English?) that lets you scan newsgroups.  Exit nn and at your host 
system's command line, type 
 
                nngrep word
 
where word is the subject you're interested in.  If you use a Macintosh 
computer, you might try
 
                nngrep mac
 
     You'll get something that looks like this:
 
               alt.music.machines.of.loving.grace
               alt.religion.emacs
               comp.binaries.mac
               comp.emacs
               comp.lang.forth.mac
               comp.os.mach
               comp.sources.mac
               comp.sys.mac.announce
               comp.sys.mac.apps
               comp.sys.mac.comm
               comp.sys.mac.databases
               comp.sys.mac.digest
               comp.sys.mac.games
               comp.sys.mac.hardware
               comp.sys.mac.hypercard
               comp.sys.mac.misc
               comp.sys.mac.programmer
               comp.sys.mac.system
               comp.sys.mac.wanted
               gnu.emacs.announce
               gnu.emacs.bug
               gnu.emacs.gnews
               gnu.emacs.gnus
               gnu.emacs.help
               gnu.emacs.lisp.manual
               gnu.emacs.sources
               gnu.emacs.vm.bug
               gnu.emacs.vm.info
               gnu.emacs.vms
 
     Note that some of these obviously have something to do with 
Macintoshes while some obviously do not; nngrep is not a perfect system.  
If you want to get a list of ALL the newsgroups available on your host 
system, type 
 
                nngrep -a |more
 
or
                nngrep -a |pg
 
and hit enter (which one to use depends on the Unix used on your host 
system; if one doesn't do anything, try the other). You don't 
absolutely need the |more or |pg, but if you don't include it, the list 
will keep scrolling, rather than pausing every 24 lines.  If you are in 
nn, hitting a capital Y will bring up a similar list. 
     Typing "nn newsgroup" for every newsgroup can get awfully tiring 
after awhile.  When you use nn, your host system looks in a file called 
.newsrc.  This is basically a list of every newsgroup on the host system 
along with notations on which groups and articles you have read (all 
maintained by the computer).  You can also use this file to create a 
"reading list" that brings up each newsgroup to which you want to 
"subscribe."  To try it out, type 
 
                nn
 
without any newsgroup name, and hit enter.  
     Unfortunately, you will start out with a .newsrc file that has you 
"subscribed" to every single newsgroup on your host system!  To delete 
a newsgroup from your reading list, type a capital U while its menu is 
on the screen.  The computer will ask you if you're sure you want to 
"unsubscribe."  If you then hit a Y, you'll be unsubscribed and put in 
the next group. 
     With many host systems carrying thousands of newsgroups, this will 
take you forever.  
     Fortunately, there are a couple of easier ways to do this.  Both 
involve calling up your .newsrc file in a word or text processor.  In a 
.newsrc file, each newsgroup takes up one line, consisting of the 
group's name, an exclamation point or a colon and a range of numbers.  
Newsgroups with a colon are ones to which you are subscribed; those 
followed by an exclamation point are "un-subscribed."  To start with a 
clean slate, then, you have to change all those colons to exclamation 
points. 
     If you know how to use emacs or vi, call up the .newsrc file (you 
might want to make a copy of .newsrc first, just in case), and use the 
search-and-replace function to make the change.
    If you're not comfortable with these text processor, you can 
download the .newsrc file, make the changes on your own computer and 
then upload the revised file.  Before you download the file, however, 
you should do a couple of things.  One is to type
 
                cp .newsrc temprc
 
and hit enter.  You will actually download this temprc file (note the 
name does not start with a period -- some computers, such as those using 
MS-DOS, do not allow file names starting with periods).  After you 
download the file, open it in your favorite word processor and use its 
search-and-replace function to change the exclamation points to colons. 
Be careful not to change anything else!  Save the document in ASCII or 
text format.  Dial back into your host system.  At the command line, 
type
 
                cp temprc temprc1
 
and hit enter.  This new file will serve as your backup .newsrc file 
just in case something goes wrong. Upload the temprc file from your 
computer.  This will overwrite the Unix system's old temprc file.  Now 
type 
 
                cp temprc .newsrc
 
and hit enter.  You now have a clean slate to start creating a reading 
list.


3.3  nn COMMANDS

 
To mark a specific article for reading, type the letter next to it (in lower 
case).  To mark a specific article and all of its responses, type the letter 
and an asterisk, for example: 
 
          a* 
 
To un-select an article, type the letter next to it (again, in lower case). 
 
C               Cancels an article (around the world) that you wrote.  
                Every article posted on Usenet has a unique ID number.  
                Hitting a capital C sends out a new message that tells host 
                systems that receive it to find earlier message and delete 
                it. 
 
F               To post a public response, or follow-up. If selected while 
                still on a newsgroup "page", asks you which article to 
                follow up.  If selected while in a specific article, will 
                follow up that article. In either case, you'll be asked if 
                you want to include the original article in yours. Caution:
                puts you in whatever text editor is your default.
 
N               Goes to the next subscribed newsgroup with unread articles. 
 
P               Goes to the previous subscribed newsgroup with unread 
                articles. 
 
G news.group    Goes to a specific newsgroup. Can be used to subscribe to 
                new newsgroups.  Hitting G brings up a sub-menu: 
 
                          u     Goes to the group and shows only un-read 
                                articles. 
 
                          a     Goes to the group and shows all articles, 
                                even ones you've already read. 
 
                          s     Will show you only articles with a specific 
                                subject. 
 
                          n     Will show you only articles from a specific 
                                person. 
 
M               Mails a copy of the current article to somebody.  You'll be 
                asked for the recipient's e-mail address and whether you 
                want to add any comments to the article before sending it 
                off.  As with F, puts you in the default editor.
 
:post           Post an article. You'll be asked for the name of the group. 
 
Q               Quit, or exit, nn. 
 
U               Un-subscribe from the current newsgroup. 
 
R               Responds to an article via e-mail. 
 
space           Hitting the space bar brings up the next page of articles. 
 
X               If you have selected articles, this will show them to you 
                and then take you to the next subscribed newsgroup with 
                unread articles. If you don't have any selected articles, 
                it marks all articles as read and takes you to the next 
                unread subscribed newsgroup. 
 
=word           Finds and marks all articles in the newsgroup with a 
                specific word in the "subject:" line, for example: 
 
                          =modem 
 
Z               Shows you selected articles immediately and then returns 
                you to the current newsgroup. 
 
?               Brings up a help screen. 
 
<               Goes to the previous page in the newsgroup. 
 
>               Goes to the next page in the newsgroup. 
 
$               Goes to the last page in an article.
 
^               Goes to the first page in an article.
 
 
3.4  USING rn


     Some folks prefer this older newsreader.   
     If you type 
 
                rn news.announce.newusers
 
at your host system's command line, you'll see something like this:
 
    ********  21 unread articles in news.announce.newusers--read now? [ynq]
 
If you hit your Y key, the first article will appear on your screen.  If 
you want to see what articles are available first, though, hit your 
computer's = key and you'll get something like this:

   The first thing to understand about Usenet is that it is widely
   misunderstood.  Every day on Usenet, the "blind men and the elephant"
   phenomenon is evident, in spades.  In my opinion, more flame wars
   arise because of a lack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than
   from any other source.  And consider that such flame wars arise, of
   necessity, among people who are on Usenet.  Imagine, then, how poorly
   understood Usenet must be by those outside!
                                                                               
   --MORE--(7%)
 
     This time, the header looks much more like the gobbledygook you get 
in e-mail messages.  To keep reading, hit your space bar.  If you hit 
your n key (lower case), you'll go to the next message in the 
numerical order.
     To escape rn, just keep hitting your q key (in lower case), until 
you get back to the command line.  Now let's set up your reading list.  
Because rn uses the same .newsrc file as nn, you can use one of the 
search-and-replace methods described above.  Or you can do this:  Type
 
                rn
 
and hit enter.  When the first newsgroup comes up on your screen, hit 
your u key (in lower case).  Hit it again, and again, and again.  Or 
just keep it pressed down (if your computer starts beeping, let up for a 
couple of seconds).  Eventually, you'll be told you're at the end of the 
newsgroups, and asked what you want to do next.  
     Here's where you begin entering newsgroups.  Type 
 
                g newsgroup
 
(for example, g comp.sys.mac.announce) and hit enter.  You'll be asked 
if you want to "subscribe." Hit your y key.  Then type
 
                g next newsgroup
 
(for example, g comp.announce.newusers) and hit enter.  Repeat until 
done.  This process will also set up your reading list for nn, if you 
prefer that newsreader. But how do you know which newsgroups to 
subscribe?  Typing a lowercase l and then hitting enter will show you a 
list of all available newsgroups.  Again, since there could be more than 
2,000 newsgroups on your system, this might not be something you want to 
do.  Fortunately, you can search for groups with particular words in 
their names, using the l command.  Typing 
 
        l mac
 
followed by enter, will bring up a list of newsgroups with those letters 
in them (and as in nn, you will also see groups dealing with emacs and 
the like, in addition to groups related to Macintosh computers).
     Because of the vast amount of messages transmitted over Usenet, 
most systems carry messages for only a few days or weeks.  So if there's 
a message you want to keep, you should either turn on your computer's 
screen capture or save it to a file which you can later download).  To 
save a message as a file in rn, type 
 
                s filename
 
where filename is what you want to call the file. Hit enter.  You'll be 
asked if you want to save it in "mailbox format."  In most cases, you 
can answer with an n (which will strip off the header).  The message 
will now be saved to a file in your News directory (which you can access 
by typing cd News and then hitting enter).  
     Also, some newsgroups fill up particularly quickly -- go away for a 
couple of days and you'll come back to find hundreds of articles!  One 
way to deal with that is to mark them as "read" so that they no longer 
appear on your screen.  In nn, hit a capital J; in rn, a small c. 


3.5  rn COMMANDS
 
 
     Different commands are available to you in rn depending on whether you 
are already in a newsgroup or reading a specific article. At any point, 
typing a lowercase h will bring up a list of available commands and some 
terse instructions for using them. Here are some of them: 
 
After you've just called up rn, or within a newsgroup:
 
c             Marks every article in a newsgroup as read (or "caught up")
              so that you don't have to see them again. The system will ask 
              you if you are sure. Can be done either when asked if you
              want to read a particular newsgroup or once in the newsgroup.
 
g             Goes to a newsgroup, in this form: 
     
                        g news.group 
      
              Use this both for going to groups to which you're already 
              subscribed and subscribing to new groups. 
 
h             Provides a list of available commands with terse 
              instructions.
 
l             Gives a list of all available newsgroups.
 
p             Goes to the first previous subscribed newsgroup with un-read 
              articles. 
 
q             Quits, or exits, rn if you have not yet gone into a newsgroup. 
              If you are in a newsgroup, it quits that one and brings you to 
              the next subscribed newsgroup. 
 
Only within a newsgroup:
 
=             Gives a list of all available articles in the newsgroup.
 
 
m             Marks a specific article or series of articles as "un-read" 
              again so that you can come back to them later. Typing
 
                        1700m
 
              and hitting enter would mark just that article as un-read. 
              Typing 
 
                        1700-1800m
 
              and hitting enter would mark all of those articles as un-
              read.
 
space         Brings up the next page of article listings.  If already on
              the last page, displays the first article in the newsgroup.
 
u             Un-subscribe from the newsgroup. 
 
/text/        Searches through the newsgroup for articles with a specific
              word or phrase in the "subject:" line, from the current 
              article to the end of the newsgroup. For example, 
 
                        /EFF/
 
              would bring you to the first article with "EFF" in the 
              "subject:" line.
 
?text?        The same as /text/ except it searches in reverse order from 
              the current article.
 
Only within a specific article:
 
e             Some newsgroups consist of articles that are binary files, 
              typically programs or graphics images.  Hitting e will convert 
              the ASCII characters within such an article into a file you
              can then download and use or view (assuming you have the proper
              computer and software).  Many times, such files will be split
              into several articles; just keep calling up the articles and
              hitting e until done.  You'll find the resulting file in your
              News subdirectory.

C             If you post an article and then decide it was a mistake, call 
              it up on your host system and hit this.  The message will soon 
              begin disappearing on systems around the world. 
 
F             Post a public response in the newsgroup to the current 
              article.  Includes a copy of her posting, which you can then 
              edit down using your host system's text editor. 
 
f             The same as above except it does not include a copy of the 
              original message in yours.
 
m             Marks the current article as "un-read" so that you can come 
              back to it later.  You do not have to type the article 
              number.       
 
Control-N     Brings up the first response to the article. If there is no 
              follow-up article, this returns you to the first unread article 
              in the newsgroup). 
 
Control-P     Goes to the message to which the current article is a reply.
 
n             Goes to the next unread article in the newsgroup. 
 
N             Takes you to the next article in the newsgroup even if you've 
              already read it.
 
q             Quits, or exits, the current article. Leaves you in the current 
              newsgroup.
 
R             Reply, via e-mail only, to the author of the current article. 
              Includes a copy of his message in yours.
 
r             The same as above, except it does not include a copy of his 
              article.
 
s file        Copies the current article to a file in your News directory, 
              where "file" is the name of the file you want to save it to. 
              You'll be asked if you want to use "mailbox" format when 
              saving. If you answer by hitting your N key, most of the 
              header will not be saved. 

s|mail user   Mails a copy of the article to somebody. For "user" substitute
              an e-mail address. Does not let you add comments to the 
              message first, however.
 
space         Hitting the space bar shows the next page of the article, or, if 
              at the end, goes to the next un-read article.


3.6  ESSENTIAL NEWSGROUPS


     With so much to choose from, everybody will likely have their own 
unique Usenet reading list.  But there are a few newsgroups that are 
particularly of interest to newcomers.  Among them:

     news.announce.newusers     This group consists of a series of
                                articles that explain various facets of
                                Usenet.

     news.newusers.questions    This is where you can ask questions 
                                (we'll see how in a bit) about how
                                Usenet works.

     news.announce.newsgroups   Look here for information about new or
                                proposed newsgroups.

     news.answers               Contains lists of "Frequently Asked
                                Questions"  (FAQs) and their answers from 
                                many different newsgroups.  Learn how to
                                fight jet lag in the FAQ from 
                                rec.travel.air; look up answers to common
                                questions about Microsoft Windows in
                                an FAQ from comp.os.ms-windows; etc.

     alt.internet.services      Looking for something in particular on 
                                the Internet?  Ask here.

     alt.infosystems.announce   People adding new information services to
                                the Internet will post details here.


3.7  SPEAKING UP


     "Threads" are an integral part of Usenet.  When somebody posts a 
message, often somebody else will respond.  Soon, a thread of 
conversation begins.  Following these threads is relatively easy.  In 
nn, related messages are grouped together.  In rn, when you're done 
with a message, you can hit control-N to read the next related 
message, or followup.  As you explore Usenet, it's probably a good 
idea to read discussions for awhile before you jump in.  This way, you 
can get a feel for the particular newsgroup -- each has its 
own rhythms.
     Eventually, though, you'll want to speak up.  There are two main 
ways to do this.  You join an existing conversation, or you can start 
a whole new thread.
     If you want to join a discussion, you have to decide if you want 
to include portions of the message you are responding to in your 
message.  The reason to do this is so people can see what you're 
responding to, just in case the original message has disappeared from 
their system (remember that most Usenet messages have a short life span 
on the average host system) or they can't find it.  
     If you're using a Unix host system, joining an existing 
conversation is similar in both nn and rn: hit your F key when done 
with a given article in the thread.  In rn, type a small f if you 
don't want to include portions of the message you're responding to; an 
uppercase F if you do. In nn, type a capital F.  You'll then be asked 
if you want to include portions of the original message. 
     And here's where you hit another Unix wall.  When you hit your F 
key, your host system calls up its basic Unix text editor.  If you're 
lucky, that'll be pico, a very easy system.  More likely, however, 
you'll get dumped into emacs (or possibly vi), which you've already met 
in the chapter on e-mail.  
     The single most important emacs command is
 
               control-x control-c
 
     This means, depress your control key and hit x.  Then depress the 
control key and hit c.  Memorize this.  In fact, it's so important, it 
bears repeating: 
 
               control-x control-c
 
     These keystrokes are how you get out of emacs.  If they work well, 
you'll be asked if you want to send, edit, abort or list the message you 
were working on.  If they don't work well (say you accidentally hit some 
other weird key combination that means something special to emacs) and 
nothing seems to happen, or you just get more weird-looking emacs 
prompts on the bottom of your screen, try hitting control-g. This should 
stop whatever emacs was trying to do (you should see the word "quit" on 
the bottom of your screen), after which you can hit control-x control-c. 
But if this still doesn't work, remember that you can always disconnect 
and dial back in! 
     If you have told your newsreader you do want to include portions 
of the original message in yours, it will automatically put the entire 
thing at the top of your message.  Use the arrow keys to move down to 
the lines you want to delete and hit control-K, which will delete one 
line at a time.
     You can then write your message.  Remember that you have to hit 
enter before your cursor gets to the end of the line, because emacs 
does not have word wrapping.
     When done, hit control-X control-C.  You'll be asked the 
question about sending, editing, aborting, etc.  Choose one.  If you 
hit Y, your host system will start the process to sending your 
message across the Net. 
     The nn and rn programs work differently when it comes to posting 
entirely new messages.  In nn, type
 
     :post
 
and hit enter in any newsgroup.  You'll be asked which newsgroup to 
post a message to.  Type in its name and hit enter.  Then you'll be 
asked for "keywords."  These are words you'd use to attract somebody 
scanning a newsgroup.  Say you're selling your car.  You might type 
the type of car here.  Next comes a "summary" line, which is somewhat 
similar.  Finally, you'll be asked for the message's "distribution."
This is where you put how widely you want your message disseminated.  
Think about this one for a second.  If you are selling your car, it 
makes little sense to send a message about it all over the world.  But 
if you want to talk about the environment, it might make a lot of 
sense.  Each host system has its own set of distribution 
classifications, but there's generally a local one (just for users of 
that system), one for the city, state or region it's in, another for 
the country (for example, usa), one for the continent (for Americans 
and Canadians, na) and finally, one for the entire world (usually: 
world).
     Which one to use?  Generally, a couple of seconds' thought will 
help you decide.  If you're selling your car, use your city or regional 
distribution -- people in Australia won't much care and may even get 
annoyed.  If you want to discuss presidential politics, using a USA 
distribution makes more sense.  If you want to talk about events in the 
Middle East, sending your message to the entire world is perfectly 
acceptable.
     Then you can type your message.  If you've composed your message 
offline (generally a good idea if you and emacs don't get along), you 
can upload it now.  You may see a lot of weird looking characters as 
it uploads into emacs, but those will disappear when you hit control-X 
and then control-C.  Alternately: "save" the message (for example, by 
hitting m in rn), log out, compose your message offline, log back on and 
upload your message into a file on your host system.  Then call up 
Usenet, find the article you "saved." Start a reply, and you'll be asked 
if you want to include a prepared message.  Type in the name of the file 
you just created and hit enter.
     In rn, you have to wait until you get to the end of a newsgroup 
to hit F, which will bring up a message-composing system.  
Alternately, at your host system's command line, you can type 
 
                Pnews
 
and hit enter.  You'll be prompted somewhat similarly to the nn 
system, except that you'll be given a list of possible distributions.  
If you chose "world," you'll get this message:
 
                                                                               
This program posts news to thousands of machines throughout the entire         
civilized world.  Your message will cost the net hundreds if not thousands of  
dollars to send everywhere.  Please be sure you know what you are doing.       
                                                                               
Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this? [ny]                         
 
     Don't worry -- your message won't really cost the Net untold 
amounts, although, again, it's a good idea to think for a second 
whether your message really should go everywhere.
     If you want to respond to a given post through e-mail, instead of 
publicly, hit R in nn or r or R in rn.  In rn, as with follow-up 
articles, the upper-case key includes the original message in yours.
     Most newsgroups are unmoderated, which means that every message 
you post will eventually wind up on every host system within the 
geographic region you specified that carries that newsgroup.
     Some newsgroups, however, are moderated, as you saw earlier with 
comp.risks.  In these groups, messages are shipped to a single 
location where a moderator, acting much like a magazine editor, 
decides what actually gets posted.  In some cases, groups are 
moderated like scholarly journals.  In other cases, it's to try to cut 
down on the massive number of messages that might otherwise be posted.  
     You'll notice that many articles in Usenet end with a fancy 
"signature" that often contains some witty saying, a clever drawing 
and, almost incidentally, the poster's name and e-mail address.  You 
too can have your own "signature" automatically appended to everything 
you post.  On your own computer, create a signature file.  Try to keep 
it to four lines or less, lest you annoy others on the Net.  Then, 
while connected to your host system, type 
 
               cat>.signature
 
and hit enter (note the period before the s).  Upload your signature 
file into this using your communications software's ASCII upload 
protocol.  When done, hit control-D, the Unix command for closing a 
file.  Now, every time you post a message, this will be appended to it. 
     There are a few caveats to posting.  Usenet is no different from 
a Town Meeting or publication: you're not supposed to break the law, 
whether that's posting copyrighted material or engaging in illegal 
activities.  It is also not a place to try to sell products (except in 
certain biz. and for-sale newsgroups).


3.8  CROSS-POSTING
 

     Sometimes, you'll have an issue you think should be discussed in 
more than one Usenet newsgroup.  Rather than posting individual messages 
in each group, you can post the same message in several groups at once, 
through a process known as cross-posting. 
     Say you want to start a discussion about the political 
ramifications of importing rare tropical fish from Brazil.  People who 
read rec.aquaria might have something to say. So might people who read 
alt.politics.animals and talk.politics.misc.
     Cross-posting is easy.  It also should mean that people on other 
systems who subscribe to several newsgroups will see your message only 
once, rather than several times -- news-reading software can cancel out 
the other copies once a person has read the message.  When you get ready 
to post a message (whether through Pnews for rn or the :post command in 
nn), you'll be asked in which newsgroups.  Type the names of the various 
groups, separated by a comma, but no space, for example: 
 
          rec.aquaria,alt.politics.animals,talk.politics.misc
 
and hit enter.  After answering the other questions (geographic 
distribution, etc.), the message will be posted in the various 
groups (unless one of the groups is moderated, in which case the 
message goes to the moderator, who decides whether to make it public). 
     It's considered bad form to post to an excessive number of 
newsgroups, or inappropriate newsgroups.  Probably, you don't really have 
to post something in 20 different places.  And while you may think your 
particular political issue is vitally important to the fate of the world, 
chances are the readers of rec.arts.comics will not, or at least not 
important enough to impose on them.  You'll get a lot of nasty e-mail 
messages demanding you restrict your messages to the "appropriate" 
newsgroups. 





Chapter 4: USENET II
 
 
4.1  FLAME, BLATHER AND SPEW
 

     Something about online communications seems to make some people 
particularly irritable.  Perhaps it's the immediacy and semi-anonymity 
of it all.  Whatever it is, there are whole classes of people you will 
soon think seem to exist to make you miserable.
     Rather than pausing and reflecting on a message as one might do 
with a letter received on paper, it's just so easy to hit your R key 
and tell somebody you don't really know what you really think of them.  
Even otherwise calm people sometimes find themselves turning into 
raving lunatics.  When this happens, flames erupt.  
     A flame is a particularly nasty, personal attack on somebody for 
something he or she has written.  Periodically, an exchange of flames 
erupts into a flame war that begin to take up all the space in a given 
newsgroup (and sometimes several; flamers like cross-posting to let the 
world know how they feel).  These can go on for weeks (sometimes they go 
on for years, in which case they become "holy wars," usually on such 
topics as the relative merits of Macintoshes and IBMs).  Often, just when 
they're dying down, somebody new to the flame war reads all the messages, 
gets upset and issues an urgent plea that the flame war be taken to e-
mail so everybody else can get back to whatever the newsgroup's business 
is.  All this usually does, though, is start a brand new flame war, in 
which this poor person comes under attack for daring to question the 
First Amendment, prompting others to jump on the attackers for impugning 
this poor soul...  You get the idea. 
     Every so often, a discussion gets so out of hand that somebody 
predicts that either the government will catch on and shut the whole 
thing down or somebody will sue to close down the network, or maybe 
even the wrath of God will smote everybody involved.  This brings what 
has become an inevitable rejoinder from others who realize that the 
network is, in fact, a resilient creature that will not die easily: 
"Imminent death of Usenet predicted. Film at 11.'' 
     Flame wars can be tremendously fun to watch at first.  They 
quickly grow boring, though.  And wait until the first time you're 
attacked!
     Flamers are not the only net.characters to watch out for.  
     Spewers assume that whatever they are particularly concerned about 
either really is of universal interest or should be rammed down the 
throats of people who don't seem to care -- as frequently as possible. 
You can usually tell a spewer's work by the number of articles he posts 
in a day on the same subject and the number of newsgroups to which he 
then sends these articles -- both can reach well into double digits. 
Often, these messages relate to various ethnic conflicts around the 
world. Frequently, there is no conceivable connection between the issue 
at hand and most of the newsgroups to which he posts.  No matter.  If you 
try to point this out in a response to one of these messages, you will be 
inundated with angry messages that either accuse you of being an 
insensitive racist/American/whatever or ignore your point entirely to 
bring up several hundred more lines of commentary on the perfidy of 
whoever it is the spewer thinks is out to destroy his people. 
     Closely related to these folks are the Holocaust revisionists, who 
periodically inundate certain groups (such as soc.history) with long 
rants about how the Holocaust never really happened.  Some people 
attempt to refute these people with facts, but others realize this only 
encourages them.
      Blatherers tend to be more benign.  Their problem is that they 
just can't get to the point -- they can wring three or four screenfuls 
out of a thought that others might sum up in a sentence or two.  A 
related condition is excessive quoting.  People afflicted with this will 
include an entire message in their reply rather than excising the 
portions not relevant to whatever point they're trying to make.  The 
worst quote a long message and then add a single line:
 
           "I agree!"
 
or some such, often followed by a monster .signature (see section 4.5)
      There are a number of other Usenet denizens you'll soon come to 
recognize.  Among them: 
     Net.weenies.  These are the kind of people who enjoy Insulting 
others, the kind of people who post nasty messages in a sewing 
newsgroup just for the hell of it. 
     Net.geeks.  People to whom the Net is Life, who worry about what 
happens when they graduate and they lose their free, 24-hour access. 
     Net.gods.  The old-timers; the true titans of the Net and the 
keepers of its collective history. They were around when the Net 
consisted of a couple of computers tied together with baling wire.
     Lurkers.  Actually, you can't tell these people are there, but 
they are.  They're the folks who read a newsgroup but never post or 
respond. 
     Wizards.  People who know a particular Net-related topic inside 
and out.  Unix wizards can perform amazing tricks with that operating 
system, for example. 
     Net.saints.  Always willing to help a newcomer, eager to share 
their knowledge with those not born with an innate ability to navigate 
the Net, they are not as rare as you might think.  Post a question 
about something and you'll often be surprised how many responses you 
get.
     The last group brings us back to the Net's oral tradition.  With 
few written guides, people have traditionally learned their way around 
the Net by asking somebody, whether at the terminal next to them or on 
the Net itself.  That tradition continues: if you have a question, ask.
     Today, one of the places you can look for help is in the 
news.newusers.questions newsgroup, which, as its name suggests, is a 
place to learn more about Usenet.  But be careful what you post.  Some 
of the Usenet wizards there get cranky sometimes when they have to 
answer the same question over and over again. Oh, they'll eventually 
answer your question, but not before they tell you should have 
asked your host system administrator first or looked at the postings in 
news.announce.newusers.
 

4.2  KILLFILES, THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS YOU 

 
     As you keep reading Usenet, you are going to run across things or 
people that really drive you nuts -- or that you just get tired of 
seeing. 
     Killfiles are just the thing for you. When you start your 
newsreader, it checks to see if you have any lists of words, phrases 
or names you don't want to see.  If you do, then it blanks out any 
messages containing those words. 
     Such as cascades. 
     As you saw earlier, when you post a reply to a message and 
include parts of that message, the original lines show up with a > in 
front of them.  Well, what if you reply to a reply?  Then you get a >> 
in front of the line.  And if you reply to that reply? You get >>>.  
Keep this up, and soon you get a triangle of >'s building up in your 
message. 
     There are people who like building up these triangles, or 
cascades.  They'll "respond" to your message by deleting everything 
you've said, leaving only the "In message 123435, you said:" part and 
the last line of your message, to which they add a nonsensical 
retort.  On and on they go until the triangle has reached the right 
end of the page. Then they try to expand the triangle by deleting one 
> with each new line. Whoever gets to finish this mega-triangle wins.        
     There is even a newsgroup just for such folks: alt.cascade.  
Unfortunately, cascaders would generally rather cascade in other 
newsgroups. Because it takes a lot of messages to build up a completed 
cascade, the targeted newsgroup soon fills up with these messages. Of 
course, if you complain, you'll be bombarded with messages about the 
First Amendment and artistic expression -- or worse, with another 
cascade. The only thing you can do is ignore them, by setting up a 
killfile. 
     There are also certain newsgroups where killfiles will come in 
handy because of the way the newsgroups are organized.  For example, 
readers of rec.arts.tv.soaps always use an acronym in their subject: line 
for the show they're writing about (AMC, for example, for "All My 
Children").  This way, people who only want to read about "One Life to 
Live" can blank out all the messages about "The Young and the Restless" 
and all the others (to keep people from accidentally screening out 
messages that might contain the letters "gh" in them, "General Hospital" 
viewers always use "gh:" in their subject lines). 
      Both nn and rn let you create killfiles, but in different ways. 
     To create a killfile in nn, go into the newsgroup with the 
offending messages and type a capital K.  You'll see this at the 
bottom of your screen: 
 
               AUTO (k)ill or (s)elect (CR => Kill subject 30 days) 
                                                                               
If you hit return, nn will ask you which article's subject you're 
tired of. Choose one and the article and any follow-ups will disappear, 
and you won't see them again for 30 days. 
     If you type a lower-case k instead, you'll get this: 
 
               AUTO KILL on (s)ubject or (n)ame  (s) 
                                                                               
If you hit your S key or just enter,  you'll see this: 
                                                                               
               KILL Subject: (=/) 
 
Type in the name of the offending word or phrase and hit enter.  
You'll then be prompted: 
                                                                               
               KILL in (g)roup 'eff.test' or in (a)ll groups  (g) 
                                                                               
except that the name of the group you see will be the one you're 
actually in at the moment.  Because cascaders and other annoying 
people often cross-post their messages to a wide range of newsgroups, 
you might consider hitting a instead of g.  Next comes: 
 
               Lifetime of entry in days (p)ermanent  (30) 
 
The P key will screen out the offending articles forever, while 
hitting enter will do it for 30 days.  You can also type in a number 
of days for the blocking. 
     Creating killfiles in rn works differently -- its default 
killfile generator only works for messages in specific groups, rather 
than globally for your entire newsgroup list.  To create a global 
killfile, you'll have to write one yourself. 
     To create a killfile in rn, go into the newsgroup where the 
offending messages are and type in its number so you get it on your 
screen. Type a capital K.  From now on, any message with that subject 
line will disappear before you read the group. You should probably 
choose a reply, rather than the original message, so that you will get 
all of the followups (the original message won't have a "Re: " in its 
subject line). The next time you call up that newsgroup, rn will tell 
you it's killing messages. When it's done, hit the space bar to go 
back into reading mode. 
     To create a "global" kill file that will automatically wipe out 
articles in all groups you read, start rn and type control-K.  This 
will start your whatever text editor you have as your default on your 
host system and create a file (called KILL, in your News 
subdirectory).         
     On the first line, you'll type in the word, phrase or name you 
don't want to see, followed by commands that tell rn whether to search 
an entire message for the word or name and then what to do when it 
finds it. 
     Each line must be in this form 
 
               /pattern/modifier:j 
 
     "Pattern" is the word or phrase you want rn to look for.  It's 
case-insensitive: both "test" and "Test" will be knocked out.  The 
modifier tells rn whether to limit its search to message headers 
(which can be useful when the object is to never see messages from a 
particular person): 
 
               a:    Looks through an entire message 
               h:    Looks just at the header 
    
     You can leave out the modifier command, in which case rn will 
look only at the subject line of messages. The "j" at the end tells rn to 
screen out all articles with the offending word. 
     So if you never want to see the word "foo" in any header, ever again, 
type this: 
 
                /foo/h:j          
 
     This is particularly useful for getting rid of articles from 
people who post in more than one newsgroup, such as cascaders, since 
an article's newsgroup name is always in the header. 
     If you just want to block messages with a subject line about 
cascades, you could try: 
  
                 /foo/:j 
 
  To kill anything that is a followup to any article, use this 
pattern: 
 
                 /Subject: *Re:/:j 
 
When done writing lines for each phrase to screen, exit the text 
editor as you normally would, and you'll be put back in rn. 
     One word of caution: go easy on the global killfile.  An 
extensive global killfile, or one that makes frequent use of the a: 
modifier can dramatically slow down rn, since the system will now have 
to look at every single word in every single message in all the 
newsgroups you want to read. 
    If there's a particular person whose posts you never want to see 
again, first find his or her address (which will be in the "from:" line 
of his postings) and then write a line in your killfile like this: 
 
                  /From: *name@address\.all/h:j


4.3  SOME USENET HINTS

 
     Case counts in Unix -- most of the time.  Many Unix commands, 
including many of those used for reading Usenet articles, are case 
sensitive.  Hit a d when you meant a D and either nothing will happen, 
or something completely different from what you expected will happen.  
So watch that case! 
     In nn, you can get help most of the time by typing a question mark 
(the exception is when you are writing your own message, because then 
you are inside the text-processing program).  In rn, type a lower-case h 
at any prompt to get some online help.
     When you're searching for a particular newsgroup, whether through 
the l command in rn or with nngrep for nn, you sometimes may have to 
try several keywords.  For example, there is a newsgroup dedicated to
the Grateful Dead, but you'd never find it if you tried, say, l grateful
dead, because the name is rec.music.gdead.  In general, try the smallest
possible part of the word or discussion you're looking for, for example,
use "trek" to find newsgroups about "Star Trek."  If one word doesn't
produce anything, try another.


4.4  THE BRAIN-TUMOR BOY, THE MODEM TAX AND THE CHAIN LETTER
     
                                 
     Like the rest of the world, Usenet has its share of urban legends 
and questionable activities.  There are three in particular that plague 
the network.  Spend more than, oh, 15 minutes within Usenet and you're 
sure to run into the Brain Tumor Boy, the plot by the evil FCC to tax 
your modem and Dave Rhode's miracle cure for poverty.  For the record, 
here's the story on all of them: 
     There once was a seven-year-old boy in England named Craig 
Shergold who was diagnosed with a seemingly incurable brain tumor.  As 
he lay dying, he wished only to have friends send him postcards.  The 
local newspapers got a hold of the tear-jerking story.  Soon, the boy's 
wish had changed: he now wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World 
Records for the largest postcard collection.  Word spread around the 
world. People by the millions sent him postcards. 
     Miraculously, the boy lived.  An American billionaire even flew 
him to the U.S. for surgery to remove what remained of the tumor.  And 
his wish succeeded beyond his wildest dreams -- he made the Guinness 
Book of World Records. 
     But with Craig now well into his teens, his dream has turned into 
a nightmare for the post office in the small town outside London where 
he lives.  Like Craig himself, his request for cards just refuses to 
die, inundating the post office with millions of cards every year.  
Just when it seems like the flow is slowing, along comes somebody else 
who starts up a whole new slew of requests for people to send Craig 
post cards (or greeting cards or business cards -- Craig letters have 
truly taken on a life of their own and begun to mutate). Even Dear Abby 
has been powerless to make it stop!
     What does any of this have to do with the Net? The Craig letter 
seems to pop up on Usenet as often as it does on cork boards at major 
corporations.  No matter how many times somebody like Gene Spafford 
posts periodic messages to ignore them or spend your money on something 
more sensible (a donation to the local Red Cross, say), somebody 
manages to post a letter asking readers to send cards to poor little 
Craig. 
     Don't send any cards to the Federal Communications Commission, 
either.
     In 1987, the FCC considered removing a tax break it had granted 
CompuServe and other large commercial computer networks for use of the 
national phone system.  The FCC quickly reconsidered after alarmed users 
of bulletin-board systems bombarded it with complaints about this "modem 
tax." 
     Now, every couple of months, somebody posts an "urgent" message 
warning Net users that the FCC is about to impose a modem tax.  This is 
NOT true.  The way you can tell if you're dealing with the hoax story 
is simple: it ALWAYS mentions an incident in which a talk-show host on 
KGO radio in San Francisco becomes outraged on the air when he reads a 
story about the tax in the New York Times.  
     Another way to tell it's not true is that it never mentions a 
specific FCC docket number or closing date for comments.
     Save that letter to your congressman for something else.
     Sooner or later, you're going to run into a message titled "Make 
Money Fast."  It's your basic chain letter.  The Usenet version is always 
about some guy named Dave Rhodes who was on the verge of death, or 
something, when he discovered a perfectly legal way to make tons of money 
-- by posting a chain letter on computer systems around the world. Yeah, 
right. 


4.5  BIG SIG

 
     There are .sigs and there are .sigs.  Many people put only bare-bones 
information in their .sig files -- their names and e-mail addresses, 
perhaps their phone numbers.  Others add a quotation they think is funny or 
profound and a disclaimer that their views are not those of their employer.
 Still others add some ASCII-art graphics.  And then there are 
those who go totally berserk, posting huge creations with multiple quotes, 
hideous ASCII "barfics" and more e-mail addresses than anybody could 
humanly need.  College freshmen unleashed on the Net seem to excel at 
these.   You can see the best of the worst in the alt.fan.warlord 
newsgroup, which exists solely to critique .sigs that go too far, such as:

4.6  THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS LOCAL ORDINANCE
 
 
     Usenet's international reach raises interesting legal questions that 
have yet to be fully resolved.  Can a discussion or posting that is legal 
in one country be transmitted to a country where it is against the law?  
Does the posting even become illegal when it reaches the border?  And 
what if that country is the only path to a third country where the 
message is legal as well?  Several foreign colleges and other 
institutions have cut off feeds of certain newsgroups where Americans 
post what is, in the U.S., perfectly legal discussions of drugs or 
alternative sexual practices.  Even in the U.S., some universities have 
discontinued certain newsgroups their administrators find offensive, 
again, usually in the alt. hierarchy. 
     An interesting example of this sort of question happened in 1993, 
when a Canadian court issued a gag order on Canadian reporters covering a 
particularly controversial murder case.  Americans, not bound by the gag 
order, began posting accounts of the trial -- which any Canadian with a 
Net account could promptly read.


4.7  USENET HISTORY  
 

      In the late 1970s, Unix developers came up with a new feature: a 
system to allow Unix computers to exchange data over phone lines.
        In 1979, two graduate students at Duke University in North 
Carolina, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, came up with the idea of using 
this system, known as UUCP (for Unix-to-Unix CoPy), to distribute 
information of interest to people in the Unix community.  Along with 
Steve Bellovin, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina 
and Steve Daniel, they wrote conferencing software and linked together 
computers at Duke and UNC. 
     Word quickly spread and by 1981, a graduate student at Berkeley, 
Mark Horton and a nearby high school student, Matt Glickman, had 
released a new version that added more features and was able to handle 
larger volumes of postings -- the original North Carolina program was 
meant for only a few articles in a newsgroup each day. 
     Today, Usenet connects tens of thousands of sites around the world, 
from mainframes to Amigas.  With more than 3,000 newsgroups and untold 
thousands of readers, it is perhaps the world's largest computer 
network. 

            
4.8 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

 
     * When you start up rn, you get a "warning" that "bogus 
newsgroups" are present.  
     Within a couple of minutes, you'll be asked whether to keep these or 
delete them.  Delete them.  Bogus newsgroups are newsgroups that your 
system administrator or somebody else has determined are no longer 
needed. 
     * While in a newsgroup in rn, you get a message: "skipping 
unavailable article."  
     This is usually an article that somebody posted and then decided to 
cancel. 
     *  You upload a text file to your Unix host system for use in a 
Usenet message or e-mail, and when you or your recipient reads the file, 
every line ends with a ^M.
     This happens because Unix handles line endings differently than MS-
DOS or Macintosh computers.  Most Unix systems have programs to convert 
incoming files from other computers. To use it, upload your file and 
then, at your command line, type

     dos2unix filename filename  or

     mac2unix filename filename

depending on which kind of computer you are using and where filename is 
the name of the file you've just uploaded.  A similar program can prepare 
text files for downloading to your computer, for example:

     unix2dos filename filename  or
     unix2mac filename filename

will ensure that a text file you are about to get will not come out 
looking odd on your computer.


4.9 FYI

 
      Leanne Phillips periodically posts a list of frequently asked 
questions (and answers) about use of the rn killfile function in the 
news.newusers.questions and news.answers newsgroups on Usenet.  Bill 
Wohler posts a guide to using the nn newsreader in the news.answers and 
news.software newsgroups.  Look in the news.announce.newusers and 
news.groups newsgroups on Usenet for "A Guide to Social Newsgroups and 
Mailing Lists,'' which gives brief summaries of the various soc. 
newsgroups. 
     "Managing UUCP and Usenet,' by Tim O'Reilly and Grace Todino 
(O'Reilly & Associates, 1992) is a good guide for setting up your own 
Usenet system.





Chapter 5: MAILING LISTS AND BITNET
 
 

5.1  INTERNET MAILING LISTS


     Usenet is not the only forum on the Net.  Scores of "mailing 
lists"  represent another way to interact with other Net users.  
Unlike Usenet messages,  which are stored in one central location on 
your host system's computer, mailing-list messages are delivered right 
to your e-mail box, unlike Usenet messages.
     You have to ask for permission to join a mailing list.  Unlike 
Usenet, where your message is distributed to the world, on a mailing 
list, you send your messages to a central moderator, who either re-mails 
it to the other people on the list or uses it to compile a periodic 
"digest" mailed to subscribers. 
     Given the number of newsgroups, why would anybody bother with a 
mailing list?  
    Even on Usenet, there are some topics that just might not generate 
enough interest for a newsgroup; for example, the Queen list, which is 
all about the late Freddie Mercury's band.  
    And because a moderator decides who can participate, a mailing list 
can offer a degree of freedom to speak one's mind (or not worry about 
net.weenies) that is not necessarily possible on Usenet.  Several 
groups offer anonymous postings -- only the moderator knows the real 
names of people who contribute. Examples include 12Step, where people 
enrolled in such programs as Alcoholics Anonymous can discuss their 
experiences, and sappho, a list limited to gay and bisexual women. 
       You can find mailing addresses and descriptions of these lists 
in the news.announce.newusers newsgroup with the subject of "Publicly 
Accessible Mailing Lists."  Mailing lists now number in the hundreds, 
so this posting is divided into three parts. 
        If you find a list to which you want to subscribe, send an e-
mail message to 
 
        list-request@address
 
where "list" is the name of the mailing list and "address" is the 
moderator's e-mail address, asking to be added to the list.  Include 
your full e-mail address just in case something happens to your 
message's header along the way, and ask, if you're accepted, for the 
address to mail messages to the list. 


5.2 BITNET
    
 
     As if Usenet and mailing lists were not enough, there are Bitnet 
"discussion groups" or "lists."  
     Bitnet is an international network linking colleges and 
universities, but it uses a different set of technical protocols for 
distributing information from the Internet or Usenet. It offers hundreds 
of discussion groups, comparable in scope to Usenet newsgroups.         
     One of the major differences is the way messages are 
distributed.  Bitnet messages are sent to your mailbox, just as with a 
mailing list. However, where mailing lists are often maintained by a 
person, all Bitnet discussion groups are automated -- you subscribe to 
them through messages to a "listserver" computer.  This is a kind of 
robot moderator that controls distribution of messages on the list.  In 
many cases, it also maintains indexes and archives of past postings in a 
given discussion group, which can be handy if you want to get up to 
speed with a discussion or just search for some information related to 
it.
     Many Bitnet discussion groups are now "translated" into Usenet 
form and carried through Usenet in the bit.listserv hierarchy.  In 
general, it's probably better to read messages through Usenet if you 
can.  It saves some storage space on your host system's hard drives.  
     If 50 people subscribe to the same Bitnet list, that means 50 
copies of each message get stored on the system; whereas if 50 people 
read a Usenet message, that's still only one message that needs storage 
on the system.  It can also save your sanity if the discussion group 
generates large numbers of messages.  Think of opening your e-mailbox 
one day to find 200 messages in it -- 199 of them from a discussion 
group and one of them a "real" e-mail message that's important to you. 
     Subscribing and canceling subscriptions is done through an e-
mail message to the listserver computer.  For addressing, all 
listservers are known as "listserv" (yep) at some Bitnet address.  
This means you will have to add ".bitnet" to the end of the 
address, if it's in a form like this: listserv@miamiu. For example, if 
you have an interest in environmental issues, you might want to 
subscribe to the Econet discussion group.  To subscribe, send an e-mail 
message to
 
                listserv@miamiu.bitnet
 
Some Bitnet listservers are also connected to the Internet, so if you 
see a listserver address ending in ".edu", you can e-mail the 
listserver without adding ".bitnet" to the end. 
     Always leave the "subject:" line blank in a message to a 
listserver.  Inside the message, you tell the listserver what you 
want, with a series of simple commands: 
 
subscribe group Your Name    To subscribe to a list, where "group"
                             is the list name and "Your Name" is 
                             your full name, for example:
                             subscribe econet Henry Fielding
 
unsubscribe group Your Name  To discontinue a group, for example:
                             unsubscribe econet Henry Fielding
 
list global                  This sends you a list of all available 
                             Bitnet discussion groups.  But be careful 
                             -- the list is VERY long! 
 
get refcard                  Sends you a list of other commands you 
                             can use with a listserver, such as 
                             commands for retrieving past postings 
                             from a discussion group. 
 
     Each of these commands goes on a separate line in your message 
(and you can use one or all of them).  If you want to get a list of 
all Bitnet discussion groups, send e-mail to 
 
                listserv@bitnic.educom.edu
 
Leave the "subject:" line blank and use the list global command.
     When you subscribe to a Bitnet group, there are two important 
differences from Usenet.
     First, when you want to post a message for others to read in the 
discussion group, you send a message to the group name at its Bitnet 
address.  Using Econet as an example, you would mail the message to: 
 
                econet@miamiu.bitnet
 
     Note that this is different from the listserv address you used to 
subscribe to the group to begin with.  Use the listserv address ONLY 
to subscribe to or unsubscribe from a discussion group.  If you use the 
discussion-group address to try to subscribe or unsubscribe, your message 
will go out to every other subscriber, many of whom will think unkind 
thoughts, which they may share with you in an e-mail message). 
      The second difference relates to sending an e-mail message to the 
author of a particular posting.  Usenet newsreaders such as rn and nn 
let you do this with one key.  But if you hit your R key to respond to 
a discussion-group message, your message will go to the listserver, 
and from there to everybody else on the list!  This can prove 
embarrassing to you and annoying to others. To make sure your 
message goes just to the person who wrote the posting, take down his 
e-mail address from the posting and then compose a brand-new message.
Remember, also, that if you see an e-mail address like IZZY@INDYVMS, it's 
a Bitnet address. 
        Two Bitnet lists will prove helpful for delving further into the 
network.  NEW-LIST tells you the names of new discussion groups. To 
subscribe, send a message to listserv@ndsuvm1.bitnet: 
 
                sub NEW-LIST Your Name
 
     INFONETS is the place to go when you have questions about Bitnet.  
It is also  first rate for help on questions about all major computer 
networks and how to reach them.  To subscribe, send e-mail to info-nets-
request@think.com: 
 
                sub INFONETS Your Name
 
     Both of these lists are also available on Usenet, the former as 
bit.listserv.new-list; the latter as bit.listserv.infonets (sometimes 
bit.listserv.info-nets).





Chapter 6: TELNET 


 
 
6.1  MINING THE NET


     Like any large community, cyberspace has its libraries, places you 
can go to look up information or take out a good book.  Telnet is one of 
your keys to these libraries. 
     Telnet is a program that lets you use the power of the Internet to 
connect you to databases, library catalogs, and other information 
resources around the world.  Want to see what the weather's like in 
Vermont? Check on crop conditions in Azerbaijan? Get more information 
about somebody whose name you've seen online? Telnet lets you do this, 
and more. 
     Alas, there's a big "but!''  Unlike the phone system, Internet is not 
yet universal;  not everybody can use all of its services.  Almost all 
colleges and universities on the Internet provide telnet access.   So do 
all of the for-fee public-access systems listed in Chapter 1. But the 
Free-Net systems do not give you access to every telnet system.  And if 
you are using a public-access UUCP or Usenet site, you will not have 
access to telnet. The main reason for this is cost.  Connecting to the 
Internet can easily cost $1,000 or more for a leased, high-speed phone 
line. Some databases and file libraries can be queried by e-mail, 
however; we'll show you how to do that later on. In the meantime, the 
rest of this chapter assumes you are connected to a site with at least 
partial Internet access. 
     Most telnet sites are fairly easy to use and have online help systems. 
Most also work best (and in some cases, only) with VT100 emulation.  
Let's dive right in and try one.
     At your host system's command line, type
 
          telnet access.usask.ca
 
and hit enter.  That's all you have to do to connect to a telnet site!  
In this case, you'll be connecting to a service known as Hytelnet, which 
is a database of computerized library catalogs and other databases 
available through telnet.  You should see something like this:
 
          Trying 128.233.3.1 ...
          Connected to access.usask.ca.
          Escape character is '^]'.
 
 
          Ultrix UNIX (access.usask.ca)
 
          login: 
 
 
     Every telnet site has two addresses -- one composed of words that 
are easier for people to remember; the other a numerical address better 
suited for computers.  The "escape character" is good to remember.  When 
all else fails, hitting your control key and the ] key at the same time 
will disconnect you and return you to your host system.  At the login 
prompt, type 
 
        hytelnet
 
and hit enter.  You'll see something like this:
 
                            Welcome to HYTELNET 
                                version 6.2  
                            ...................

                          ........................
                      HYTELNET 6.2 was written by Peter Scott,
         U of Saskatchewan Libraries, Saskatoon, Sask, Canada.  1992
     Unix and VMS software by Earl Fogel, Computing Services, U of S 1992
                                                                       
      The first choice, "<WHATIS>" will be highlighted.  Use your down 
and up arrows to move the cursor among the choices.  Hit enter when you 
decide on one.  You'll get another menu, which in turn will bring up 
text files telling you how to connect to sites and giving any special 
commands or instructions you might need.  Hytelnet does have one quirk. 
To move back to where you started (for example, from a sub-menu to a 
main menu), hit the left-arrow key on your computer.  
     Play with the system.  You might want to turn on your computer's 
screen-capture, or at the very least, get out a pen and paper. You're 
bound to run across some interesting telnet services that you'll want to 
try -- and you'll need their telnet "addresses.''
     As you move around Hytelnet, it may seem as if you haven't left 
your host system -- telnet can work that quickly.  Occasionally, when 
network loads are heavy, however, you will notice a delay between the 
time you type a command or enter a request and the time the remote 
service responds. 
     To disconnect from Hytelnet and return to your system, hit your q 
key and enter. 
     Some telnet computers are set up so that you can only access them 
through a specific "port."  In those cases, you'll always see a number 
after their name, for example:  india.colorado.edu 13. It's important to 
include that number, because otherwise, you may not get in.
     In fact, try the above address. Type
 
                telnet india.colorado.edu 13
 
and hit enter.  You should see something like this:
 
                Trying 128.138.140.44 ...
 
Followed very quickly by this:
 
               telnet india.colorado.edu 13 
        
                Escape character is '^]'.
                Sun Jan 17 14:11:41 1994
                Connection closed by foreign host.
 
     
     What we want is the middle line, which tells you the exact 
Mountain Standard Time, as determined by a government-run atomic clock 
in Boulder, Colo. 
                   
 
6.2  LIBRARY CATALOGS
     

     Several hundred libraries around the world, from the Snohomish 
Public Library in Washington State to the Library of Congress are now 
available to you through telnet. You can use Hytelnet to find their 
names, telnet addresses and use instructions. 
     Why would you want to browse a library you can't physically get to?  
Many libraries share books, so if yours doesn't have what you're looking 
for, you can tell the librarian where he or she can get it.  Or if you live 
in an area where the libraries are not yet online, you can use telnet to do 
some basic bibliographic research before you head down to the local branch. 
     There are several different database programs in use by online 
libraries.  Harvard's is one of the easier ones to use, so let's try it.
     Telnet to hollis.harvard.edu.  When you connect, you'll see:

     The first thing to notice is the name of the system: Hollis. 
Librarians around the world seem to be inordinately found of cutesy, 
anthropomorphized acronyms for their machines (not far from Harvard, the 
librarians at Brandeis University came up with Library On-Line User 
Information Service, or Louis; MIT has Barton). 
     If you want to do some general browsing, probably the best bet on the 
Harvard system is to choose HU, which gets you access to their main 
holdings, including those of its medical libraries.  Choose that, and you'll 
see this:

     One particularly interesting system is the one run by the Colorado 
Alliance of Research Libraries, which maintains databases for libraries 
throughout Colorado, the West and even in Boston.
     Telnet pac.carl.org.
     Follow the simple log-in instructions. When you get a menu, type 72 
(even though that is not listed), which takes you to the Pikes Peak Library 
District, which serves the city of Colorado Springs.
     Several years ago, its librarians realized they could use their 
database program not just for books but for cataloging city records and 
community information, as well.  Today, if you want to look up municipal 
ordinances or city records, you only have to type in the word you're 
looking for and you'll get back cites of the relevant laws or decisions.
     Carl will also connect you to the University of Hawaii library, which, 
like the one in Colorado Springs, has more than just bibliographic material

you everything you ever wanted to know about Hawaiians, including the

6.3  SOME INTERESTING TELNET SITES
 
 
AGRICULTURE
 
     PENPages, run by Pennsylvania State University's College of 
Agricultural Sciences, provides weekly world weather and crop reports 
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These reports detail 
everything from the effect of the weather on palm trees in Malaysia to 
the state of the Ukrainian wheat crop. Reports from Pennsylvania 
country extension officers offer tips for improving farm life. One 
database lists Pennsylvania hay distributors by county -- and rates 
the quality of their hay! 
     The service lets you search for information two different ways. A 
menu system gives you quick access to reports that change frequently, 
such as the weekly crop/weather reports. An index system lets you 
search through several thousand online documents by keyword. At the 
main menu, you can either browse through an online manual or choose 
"PENPages,'' which puts you into the agriculture system. 
     Telnet: psupen.psu.edu
     User name: Your 2-letter state code or WORLD
 
     California State University's Advanced Technology Information 
Network provides similar information as PENPages, only focusing on 
California crops. It also maintains lists of upcoming California trade 
shows and carries updates on biotechnology. 
     Telnet:  caticsuf.cati.csufresno.edu 
     Log in:  public 
 
    You will then be asked to register and will be given a user name 
and password.  Hit "a'' at the main menu for agricultural information.  
Hit "d'' to call up a menu that includes a biweekly biotechnology 
report. 
 
 
AIDS
 
     The University of Miami maintains a database of AIDS health 
providers in southern Florida.
     Telnet:  callcat.med.miami.edu
     Log in:  library
 
     At the main menu, select P (for "AIDS providers" and you'll be able 
to search for doctors, hospitals and other providers that care for 
patients with AIDS.  You can also search by speciality.
 
     See also under Conversation and Health.
 
 
AMATEUR RADIO:
 
     The National Ham Radio Call-Sign Callbook lets you search for 
American amateur operators by callsign, city, last name or Zip code. A 
successful search will give you the ham's name, address, callsign, 
age, type of license and when he or she got it. 
     Telnet:  callsign.cs.buffalo.edu 2000 or ham.njit.edu 2000.
     When you connect, you tell the system how you want to search and 
what you're looking for. For example, if you want to search for hams 
by city, you would type 
 
          city city name 
 
and hit enter (for example: city Kankakee).
     Other search choices are "call" (after which you would type a 
ham's name), "name," and "zip" (which you would follow with a Zip 
code).  Be careful when searching for hams in a large city; there 
doesn't seem to be anyway to shut off the list once it starts except 
by using control-]. Otherwise, when done, type 
 
               quit 
 
and hit enter to disconnect.

    READY FOR NEW COMMAND:
 
CONVERSATION
    
     Communications Canada, a Canadian government agency is developing 
Conversational Hypertext Access Technology (CHAT) is a system being 
developed by Communications Canada to provide easy database access to 
people with little or no computer experience, using what are known as 
hypertext links.  Instead of cryptic computer commands, users type 
questions in English. 
    Telnet:  debra.doc.ca 
    Log in:  chat 
    You choose one of the three databases now online, one on AIDS, and 
then ask questions in English. 
    Ask the AIDS database, "When was AIDS first discovered?'' and it 
answers: 
    "The first case of AIDS in North America was diagnosed in 1979.  
Before that, it existed in Africa, probably beginning in the 1950's.  
AIDS was discovered in North America when a number of young men with a 
history of homosexuality developed a rare type of cancer called 
Kaposi's sarcoma.'' 
    Sometimes, you do have to rephrase your question. For example, 
when asked "What is the link between AIDS and drug use?'' the computer 
responds: 
    "I know two things about drugs: the drugs that are used to treat 
people with AIDS, and the risks that drug users have in getting AIDS.  
Please ask about treatments or drug users.''

6.4  TELNET BULLETIN-BOARD SYSTEMS
 
 
     You might think that Usenet, with its hundreds of newsgroups, 
would be enough to satisfy the most dedicated of online communicators. 
     But there are a number of "bulletin-board" and other systems that 
provide even more conferences or other services, many not found 
directly on the Net.  Some are free; others charge for access.  They 
include: 
 
     Bookstacks Unlimited is a Cleveland bookstore that uses the Internet
to advertise its services.  Its online system features not only a catalog, 
however, but conferences on books and literature.
     Telnet: books.com

6.5  PUTTING THE FINGER ON SOMEONE
 
     Finger is a handy little program which lets you find out more about 
people on the Net -- and lets you tell others on the Net more about 
yourself. 
     Finger uses the same concept as telnet or ftp. But it works with 
only one file, called .plan (yes, with a period in front).  This is a 
text file an Internet user creates with a text editor in his home 
directory.  You can put your phone number in there, tell a little bit 
about yourself, or write almost anything at all.
     To finger somebody else's .plan file, type this at the command 
line:
 
     finger email-address
 
where email-address is the person's e-mail address.  You'll get back a 
display that shows the last time the person was online, whether 
they've gotten any new mail since that time and what, if anything, is 
in their .plan file.
     Some people and institutions have come up with creative uses for 
these .plan files, letting you do everything from checking the weather 
in Massachusetts to getting the latest baseball standings.  Try 
fingering these e-mail addresses:
 
weather@cirrus.mit.edu            Latest National Weather Service weather 
                                  forecasts for regions in Massachusetts.
 
quake@geophys.washington.edu      Locations and magnitudes of recent 
                                  earthquakes around the world. 
 
jtchern@ocf.berkeley.edu          Current major-league baseball standings and 
                                  results of the previous day's games.
 
nasanews@space.mit.edu            The day's events at NASA.
 
coke@cs.cmu.edu                   See how many cans of each type of soda
                                  are left in a particular soda machine
                                  in the computer-science department of
                                  Carnegie-Mellon University.


6.6  FINDING SOMEONE ON THE NET
 

     So you have a friend and you want to find out if he has an Internet 
account to which you can write?  The quickest way may be to just pick up 
the phone, call him and ask him.  Although there are a variety of "white 
pages" services available on the Internet, they are far from complete -- 
college students, users of commercial services such as CompuServe and 
many Internet public-access sites, and many others simply won't be 
listed.  Major e-mail providers are working on a universal directory 
system, but that could be some time away.
     In the meantime, a couple of "white pages" services might give you 
some leads, or even just entertain you as you look up famous people or 
long-lost acquaintances.
     The whois directory provides names, e-mail and postal mail address 
and often phone numbers for people listed in it.  To use it, telnet to
 
     internic.net
 
No log-on is needed.  The quickest way to use it is to type
 
     whois name
 
at the prompt, where "name" is the last name or organization name you're 
looking for.
     Another service worth trying, especially since it seems to give 
beginners fewer problems, is the Knowbot Information Service reachable by 
telnet at
 
     info.cnri.reston.va.us 185

Again, no log-on is needed.  This service actually searches through a 
variety of other "white pages" systems, including the user directory for 
MCIMail.  To look for somebody, type
 
     query name
 
where "name" is the last name of the person you're looking for.  You can 
get details of other commands by hitting a question mark at the prompt. 
You can also use the knowbot system by e-mail.  Start a message to

     netaddress@info.cnri.reston.va.us
 
You can leave the "subject:" line blank. As your message, type

     query name

for the simplest type of search.  If you want details on more complex
searches, add another line:
 
     man

     Another way to search is via the Usenet name server. This is a 
system at MIT that keeps track of the e-mail addresses of everybody who 
posts a Usenet message that appears at MIT. It works by e-mail.  Send a 
message to 
     
          mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

Leave the "subject:" line blank. As your message, write 

           send usenet-addresses/lastname

where "lastname" is the last name of the person you're looking for.
 

6.7  WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
 
     * Nothing happens when you try to connect to a telnet site.  
     The site could be down for maintenance or problems. 
     * You get a "host unavailable" message.  The telnet site is down 
for some reason.  
     Try again later. 
     * You get a "host unknown" message.  
     Check your spelling of the site name. 
     * You type in a password on a telnet site that requires one, and 
you get a "login incorrect" message.  
     Try logging in again.  If you get the message again, hit your 
control and ] keys at the same time to disengage and return to your host 
system. 
     * You can't seem to disconnect from a telnet site.  
     Use control-] to disengage and return to your host system. 


6.8  FYI
 
     The Usenet newsgroups alt.internet.services and alt.bbs.internet 
can provide pointers to new telnet systems.  Scott Yanoff periodically 
posts his "Updated Internet Services List" in the former.   The 
alt.bbs.internet newsgroup is also where you'll find Aydin Edguer's 
compendium of FAQs related to Internet bulletin-board systems.                 
     Peter Scott, who maintains the Hytelnet database, runs a 
mailing list about new telnet services and changes in existing ones.   
To get on the list, send him a note at scott@sklib.usask.ca.
     Gleason Sackman maintains another mailing list dedicated to new 
Internet services and news about the new uses to which the Net is being 
put.  To subscribe, send a message to listserv@internic.net. Leave the 
"subject:" line blank, and as your message, write: Sub net-happenings 
Your Name. 





Chapter 7: FTP
 
 

7.1  TONS OF FILES

     Hundreds of systems connected to Internet have file libraries, or 
archives, accessible to the public. Much of this consists of free or low-
cost shareware programs for virtually every make of computer.  If you 
want a different communications program for your IBM, or feel like 
playing a new game on your Amiga, you'll be able to get it from the Net. 
     But there are also libraries of documents as well.  If you 
want a copy of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, you can find it on 
the Net.  Copies of historical documents, from the Magna Carta to the 
Declaration of Independence are also yours for the asking, along with a 
translation of a telegram from Lenin ordering the execution of 
rebellious peasants.  You can also find song lyrics, poems, even 
summaries of every "Lost in Space" episode ever made.  You can also find 
extensive files detailing everything you could ever possibly want to know 
about the Net itself.  First you'll see how to get these files; then 
we'll show you where they're kept.
     The commonest way to get these files is through the file transfer 
protocol, or ftp.  As with telnet, not all systems that connect to the 
Net have access to ftp.  However, if your system is one of these, you'll 
be able to get many of these files through e-mail (see the next chapter). 
     Starting ftp is as easy as using telnet. At your host system's command
line, type 
 
          ftp site.name
 
and hit enter, where "site.name" is the address of the ftp site you want 
to reach.  One major difference between telnet and ftp is that it is 
considered bad form to connect to most ftp sites during their business 
hours (generally 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time).  This is because 
transferring files across the network takes up considerable computing 
power, which during the day is likely to be needed for whatever the 
computer's main function is.  There are some ftp sites that are 
accessible to the public 24 hours a day, though.  You'll find these noted 
in the list of ftp sites in section 7.6


7.2  YOUR FRIEND ARCHIE


     How do you find a file you want, though?
     Until a few years ago, this could be quite the pain -- there was 
no master directory to tell you where a given file might be stored on 
the Net. Who'd want to slog through hundreds of file libraries looking 
for something? 
     Alan Emtage, Bill Heelan and Peter Deutsch, students at McGill 
University in Montreal, asked the same question.  Unlike the weather, 
though, they did something about it.
     They created a database system, called archie, that would 
periodically call up file libraries and basically find out what they had 
available.  In turn, anybody could dial into archie, type in a file name, 
and see where on the Net it was available. Archie currently catalogs 
close to 1,000 file libraries around the world. 
     Today, there are three ways to ask archie to find a file for you: 
through telnet, "client" Archie program on your own host system or e-
mail.  All three methods let you type in a full or partial file name and 
will tell you where on the Net it's stored. 
 If you have access to telnet, you can telnet to one of the following 
addresses: archie.mcgill.ca; archie.sura.net; archie.unl.edu; 
archie.ans.net; or archie.rutgers.edu.  If asked for a log-in name, type
 
           archie
 
and hit enter.
     When you connect, the key command is prog, which you use in this 
form: 
 
            prog filename
 
followed by enter, where "filename" is the program or file you're 
looking for. If you're unsure of a file's complete name, try typing in 
part of the name. For example, "PKZIP" will work as well as 
"PKZIP204.EXE."  The system does not support DOS or Unix wildcards.  
If you ask archie to look for "PKZIP*," it will tell you it couldn't 
find anything by that name.  One thing to keep in mind is that a file is 
not necessarily the same as a program -- it could also be a document.  
This means you can use archie to search for, say, everything online 
related to the Beetles, as well as computer programs and graphics files.
     A number of Net sites now have their own archie programs that 
take your request for information and pass it onto the nearest archie 
database -- ask your system administrator if she has it online. These 
"client" programs seem to provide information a lot more quickly than the 
actual archie itself!  If it is available, at your host system's command 
line, type 
 
     archie -s filename
 
where filename is the program or document you're looking for, and hit 
enter.  The -s tells the program to ignore case in a file name and lets 
you search for partial matches. You might actually want to type it this 
way: 
 
          archie -s filename|more
 
which will stop the output every screen (handy if there are many sites 
that carry the file you want).  Or you could open a file on your computer 
with your text-logging function. 
      The third way, for people without access to either of the above, is e-
mail.
     Send a message to archie@quiche.cs.mcgill.ca. You can leave the 
subject line blank.  Inside the message, type 
 
          prog filename
 
where filename is the file you're looking for.  You can ask archie to 
look up several programs by putting their names on the same "prog" line, 
like this:
                       
          prog file1 file2 file3
      
     Within a few hours, archie will write back with a list of the 
appropriate sites. 
       In all three cases, if there is a system that has your file, 
you'll get a response that looks something like this:
 
 Host sumex-aim.stanford.edu
 
     Location: /info-mac/comm
            FILE -rw-r--r--     258256  Feb 15 17:07  zterm-09.hqx
     Location: /info-mac/misc
            FILE -rw-r--r--       7490  Sep 12 1991  zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx
 
 
     Chances are, you will get a number of similar looking responses 
for each program.  The "host" is the system that has the file.  The 
"Location" tells you which directory to look in when you connect to 
that system.  Ignore the funny-looking collections of r's and hyphens 
for now.  After them, come the size of the file or directory listing 
in bytes, the date it was uploaded, and the name of the file.  


7.3  GETTING THE FILES

     Now you want to get that file.
     Assuming your host site does have ftp, you connect in a similar 
fashion to telnet, by typing: 
 
          ftp sumex-aim.stanford.edu
 
(or the name of whichever site you want to reach). Hit enter.  If the 
connection works, you'll see this: 
 
  Connected to sumex-aim.stanford.edu.
  220 SUMEX-AIM FTP server (Version 4.196 Mon Jan 13 13:52:23 PST 1992) ready.
  Name (sumex-aim.stanford.edu:adamg): 
 
     If nothing happens after a minute or so, hit control-C to return 
to your host system's command line.  But if it has worked, type
 
          anonymous
 
and hit enter.  You'll see a lot of references on the Net to 
"anonymous ftp." This is how it gets its name -- you don't really have 
to tell the library site what your name is. The reason is that these 
sites are set up so that anybody can gain access to certain public 
files, while letting people with accounts on the sites to log on and 
access their own personal files.  Next, you'll be asked for your 
password.  As a password, use your e-mail address.  This will then come 
up: 
     
          230 Guest connection accepted. Restrictions apply.
          Remote system type is UNIX.
          Using binary mode to transfer files.
          ftp>
 
 
Now type 
         
          ls
 
and hit enter.  You'll see something awful like this: 
 
          200 PORT command successful.
          150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.
          total 2636

          226 Transfer complete.
          ftp> 
 
     Ack! Let's decipher this Rosetta Stone.
     First, ls is the ftp command for displaying a directory (you can 
actually use dir as well, but if you're used to MS-DOS, this could lead 
to confusion when you try to use dir on your host system, where it won't 
work, so it's probably better to just remember to always use ls for a 
directory while online).                          
     The very first letter on each line tells you whether the listing is 
for a directory or a file. If the first letter is a ``d,'' or an "l", 
it's a directory. Otherwise, it's a file. 
     The rest of that weird set of letters and dashes consist of "flags" 
that tell the ftp site who can look at, change or delete the file. You 
can safely ignore it. You can also ignore the rest of the line until you 
get to the second number, the one just before the date. This tells you 
how large the file is, in bytes. If the line is for a directory, the 
 number gives you a rough indication of how many items are in that 
directory  -- a directory listing of 512 bytes is relatively small. Next 
comes the date the file or directory was uploaded, followed (finally!) by 
its name. 
     Notice the README.POSTING file up at the top of the directory. Most 
archive sites have a "read me" document, which usually contains some 
basic information about the site, its resources and how to use them. 
Let's get this file, both for the information in it and to see how to 
transfer files from there to here. At the ftp> prompt, type 
 
          get README

 and hit enter. Note that ftp sites are no different from Unix sites in 
general: they are case-sensitive. You'll see something like this: 

  200 PORT command successful. 
  150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for README (4444 bytes). 
  226 Transfer complete. 4444 bytes received in 1.177seconds (3.8 Kbytes/s)
 
And that's it! The file is now located in your home directory on your host 
system, from which you can now download it to your own computer. The 
simple "get" command is the key to transferring a file from an archive 
site to your host system. 
     If you want to download more than one file at a time (say a series
of documents, use mget instead of get; for example:

         mget *.txt

This will transfer copies of every file ending with .txt in the given
directory.  Before each file is copied, you'll be asked if you're sure
you want it.  Despite this, mget could still save you considerable 
time -- you won't have to type in every single file name. If you want to
save even more time, and are sure you really want ALL of the given files, 
type

          prompt

before you do the mget command. This will turn off the prompt, and all 
the files will be zapped right into your home directory.

        There is one other command to keep in mind.  If you want to get a 
copy of a computer program, type
 
         bin
 
and hit enter.  This tells the ftp site and your host site that you are 
sending a binary file, i.e., a program.  Most ftp sites now use binary 
format as a default, but it's a good idea to do this in case you've 
connected to one of the few that doesn't. 
     To switch to a directory, type 
 
          cd directory-name
 
(substituting the name of the directory you want to access) and hit 
enter. Type 
 
          ls 
 
and hit enter to get the file listing for that particular directory.  
To move back up the directory tree, type 
 
          cd .. 
 
(note the space between the d and the first period) and hit enter.  Or 
you could type 
 
         cdup 
 
and hit enter.  Keep doing this until you get to the directory of 
interest.  Alternately, if you already know the directory path of the 
file you want (from our friend archie), after you connect, you could 
simply type
 
        get directory/subdirectory/filename
 
     On many sites, files meant for public consumption are in the pub 
or public directory; sometimes you'll see an info directory.
     Almost every site has a bin directory, which at first glance 
sounds like a bin in which interesting stuff might be dumped.  But it 
actually stands for "binary" and is simply a place for the system 
administrator to store the programs that run the ftp system. Lost+found 
is another directory that looks interesting but actually never has 
anything of public interest in them.
     Before, you saw how to use archie.  From our example, you can see 
that some system administrators go a little berserk when naming files. 
Fortunately, there's a way for you to rename the file as it's being 
transferred. Using our archie example, you'd type 
 
            get zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx zterm.hqx
 
and hit enter.  Instead of having to deal constantly with a file called 
zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx, you'll now have one called, simply, 
zterm.hqx.
    Those last three letters bring up something else: Many program files 
are compressed to save on space and transmission time.  In order to 
actually use them, you'll have to use an un-compress program on them first.


7.4  ODD LETTERS -- DECODING FILE ENDINGS


      There are a wide variety of compression methods in use.  You can 
tell which method was used by the last one to three letters at the end of 
a file. Here are some of the more common ones and what you'll need to un-
compress the files they create (most of these decompression programs can 
be located through archie). 

.txt or .TXT  By itself, this means the file is a document, rather than a 
              program. 

.ps or .PS    A PostScript document (in Adobe's page description 
              language).  You can print this file on any PostScript 
              capable printer, or use a previewer, like GNU project's 
              GhostScript. 

.doc or .DOC  Another common "extension" for documents.  No decompression 
              is needed, unless it is followed by:

.Z            This indicates a Unix compression method. To uncompress, 
              type

                   uncompress filename.Z

              and hit enter at your host system's command line. If the
              file is a compressed text file, you can read it online by
              instead typing

                   zcat filename.txt.Z |more

              u16.zip is an MS-DOS program that will let you download 
              such a file and uncompress it on your own computer. The
              Macintosh equivalent program is called MacCompress (use
              archie to find these).

.zip or .ZIP  These indicate the file has been compressed with a common
              MS-DOS compression program, known as PKZIP (use archie to
              find PKZIP204.EXE).  Many Unix systems will let you un-ZIP
              a file with a program called, well, unzip.

.gz           A Unix version of ZIP.  To uncompress, type

                   gunzip filename.gz

              at your host system's command line.

.zoo or .ZOO  A Unix and MS-DOS compression format.  Use a program called 
              zoo to uncompress

.Hqx or .hqx  Mactintosh compression format. Requires the BinHex program.

.shar or      Another Unix format. Use unshar to uncompress.
.Shar

.tar          Another Unix format, often used to compress several related
              files into one large file. Most Unix systems will have a 
              program called tar for "un-tarring" such files.  Often, a 
              "tarred" file will also be compressed with the gz method,
              so you first have to use uncompress and then tar.

.sit or .Sit  A Mactinosh format that requires the StuffIt program.

.ARC          Another MS-DOS format, which requires the use of the ARC
              or ARCE programs.

.LHZ          Another MS-DOS format; requires the use of LHARC.

     A few last words of caution: Check the size of a file before you get 
it. The Net moves data at phenomenal rates of speed.  But that 500,000-
byte file that gets transferred to your host system in a few seconds 
could take more than an hour or two to download to your computer if 
you're using a 2400-baud modem.  Your host system may also have limits on 
the amount of bytes you can store online at any one time.  Also, although 
it is really extremely unlikely you will ever get a file infected with a 
virus, if you plan to do much downloading over the Net, you'd be wise to 
invest in a good anti-viral program, just in case.


7.5  THE KEYBOARD CABAL
 
 
    System administrators are like everybody else -- they try to make 
things easier for themselves.  And when you sit in front of a keyboard 
all day, that can mean trying everything possible to reduce the number 
of keys you actually have to hit each day.
     Unfortunately, that can make it difficult for the rest of us.
     You've already read about bin and lost+found directories. Etc is 
another seemingly interesting directory that turns out to be another 
place to store files used by the ftp site itself.  Again, nothing of any
real interest.
     Then, once you get into the actual file libraries, you'll find that
in many cases, files will have such non-descriptive names as V1.1-
AK.TXT.  The best known example is probably a set of several hundred 
files known as RFCs, which provide the basic technical and 
organizational information on which much of the Internet is built.  
These files can be found on many ftp sites, but always in a form such as 
RFC101.TXT, RFC102.TXT and so on, with no clue whatsoever as to what 
information they contain.
     Fortunately, almost all ftp sites have a "Rosetta Stone" to help 
you decipher these names.  Most will have a file named README (or some 
variant) that gives basic information about the system.  Then, most 
directories will either have a similar README file or will have an index 
that does give brief descriptions of each file.  These are usually the 
first file in a directory and often are in the form 00INDEX.TXT.  Use 
the ftp command to get this file.  You can then scan it online or 
download it to see which files you might be interested in. 
     Another file you will frequently see is called ls-lR.Z.  This contains
a listing of every file on the system, but without any descriptions (the
name comes from the Unix command ls -lR, which gives you a listing of all
the files in all your directories).  The Z at the end means the file has
been compressed, which means you will have to use a Unix un-compress command
before you can read the file.
     And finally, we have those system administrators who almost seem to
delight in making things difficult -- the ones who take full advantage of
Unix's ability to create absurdly long file names.  On some FTP sites, you
will see file names as long as 80 characters or so, full of capital letters,
underscores and every other orthographic device that will make it almost
impossible for you to type the file name correctly when you try to get it.
Your secret weapon here is the mget command.  Just type mget, a space, and
the first five or six letters of the file name, followed by an asterisk, for
example:
 
          mget This_F*
 
The FTP site will ask you if you want to get the file that begins with that 
name. If there are several files that start that way, you might have to 
answer 'n' a few times, but it's still easier than trying to recreate a 
ludicrously long file name.


7.6  SOME INTERESTING FTP SITES
 

     What follows is a list of some interesting ftp sites, arranged by 
category. With hundreds of ftp sites now on the Net, however, this list 
barely scratches the surface of what is available.  Liberal use of archie 
will help you find specific files.                  
     The times listed for each site are in Eastern time and represent 
the periods during which it is considered acceptable to connect. 
 
AMIGA 
 
     ftp.uu.net  Has Amiga programs in the systems/amiga directory. 
     Available 24 hours.

BOOKS 
 
     rtfm.mit.edu   The pub/usenet/rec.arts.books directories has 
reading lists for various authors as well as lists of recommended 
bookstores in different cities.  Unfortunately, this site uses incredibly 
long file names -- so long they may scroll off the end of your screen if 
you are using an MS-DOS or certain other computers.  Even if you want 
just one of the files, it probably makes more sense to use mget than get.  
This way, you will be asked on each file whether you want to get it; 
otherwise you may wind up frustrated because the system will keep telling 
you the file you want doesn't exist (since you may miss the end of its 
name due to the scrolling problem). 
     6 p.m. - 6 a.m.
                       
     mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu  Project Gutenberg is an effort to translate

weather images of North America.  Files are updated hourly and take this 
general form: CV100222.  The first two letters tell the type of file: CV 
means it is a visible-light photo taken by a weather satellite.  CI 
images are similar, but use infrared light.  Both these are in black and 
white.  Files that begin with SA are color radar maps of the U.S. that 
show severe weather patterns but also fronts and temperatures in major 
cities.  The numbers indicate the date and time (in GMT - five hours 
ahead of EST) of the image: the first two numbers represent the month, 
the next two the date, the last two the hour. The file WXKEY.GIF explains 
the various symbols in SA files.
 

7.7  ncftp -- NOW YOU TELL ME!

     
     If you're lucky, the people who run your host system or public-
access site have installed a program called ncftp, which takes some of 
the edges off the ftp process.
     For starters, when you use ncftp instead of plain old ftp, you no 
longer have to worry about misspelling "anonymous" when you connect.  The 
program does it for you.  And once you're in, instead of getting line 
after line filled with dashes, x's, r's and d's, you only get listings of 
the files or directories themselves (if you're used to MS-DOS, the 
display you get will be very similar to that produced by the dir/w 
command).  The program even creates a list of the ftp sites you've used 
most recently, so you can pick from that list, instead of trying to 
remember some incredibly complex ftp site name.
     Launching the program, assuming your site has it, is easy.  At the 
command prompt, type

        ncftp sitename

where "sitename" is the site you want to reach (alternately, you could 
type just ncftp and then use its open command).  Once connected, you can 
use the same ftp commands you've become used to, such as ls, get and 
mget.  Entries that end in a / are directories to which you can switch 
with cd; others are files you can get. A couple of useful ncftp commands 
include type, which lets you change the type of file transfer (from ASCII 
to binary for example) and size, which lets you see how large a file is 
before you get it, for example

        size declaration.txt

would tell you how large the declaration.txt file is before you get it.  
When you say "bye" to disconnect from a site, ncftp remembers the last 
directory you were in, so that the next time you connect to the site, you 
are put back into that directory automatically. If you type 

        help

you'll get a list of files you can read to extend the power of the 
program even further.


7.8 PROJECT GUTENBERG -- ELECTRONIC BOOKS

     Project Gutenberg, coordinated by Michael Hart, has a fairly 
ambitious goal: to make more than 10,000 books and other documents 
available electronically by the year 2001.  In 1993, the project uploaded 
an average of four books a month to its ftp sites; in 1994, they hope to 
double the pace.
     Begun in 1971, the project already maintains a "library" of hundreds 
of books and stories, from Aesop's Fables to "Through the Looking Glass" 
available for the taking.  It also has a growing number of current-
affairs documents, such as the CIA's annual "World Factbook" almanac.
     Besides nptn.org, Project Gutenberg texts can be retrieved from 
mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu in the etext directory.


7.9  WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

 
     * You get a "host unavailable" message.  The ftp site is down for 
some reason.  
     Try again later.
     * You get a "host unknown" message.  
     Check your spelling of the site name. 
     * You misspell "anonymous" when logging in and get a message 
telling you a password is required for whatever you typed in.  
     Type something in, hit enter, type bye, hit enter, and try again. 
Alternately, try typing "ftp" instead of "anonymous."  It will work on a 
surprising number of sites. Or just use ncftp, if your site has it, and 
never worry about this again. 


7.10  FYI
 
     Liberal use of archie will help you find specific files or 
documents.  For information on new or interesting ftp sites, try the 
comp.archives newsgroup on Usenet.  You can also look in the comp.misc, 
comp.sources.wanted or news.answers newsgroups on Usenet for lists of ftp 
sites posted every month by Tom Czarnik and Jon Granrose. 
     The comp.archives newsgroup carries news of new ftp sites and 
interesting new files on existing sites.                                   
     In the comp.virus newsgroup on Usenet, look for postings that list 
ftp sites carrying anti-viral software for Amiga, MS-DOS, Macintosh, 
Atari and other computers. 
     The comp.sys.ibm.pc.digest and comp.sys.mac.digest newsgroups

Chapter 8:  GOPHERS, WAISs AND THE WORLD-WIDE WEB
 
 


8.1.  GOPHERS


     Even with tools like Hytelnet and archie, telnet and ftp can still 
be frustrating.  There are all those telnet and ftp addresses to 
remember.  Telnet services often have their own unique commands.  And, 
oh, those weird directory and file names!
     But now that the Net has become a rich repository of information, 
people are developing ways to make it far easier to find and retrieve 
information and files. Gophers and Wide-Area Information Servers (WAISs) 
are two services that could ultimately make the Internet as easy to 
navigate as commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy.
     Both gophers and WAISs essentially take a request for information 
and then scan the Net for it, so you don't have to.  Both also work 
through menus -- instead of typing in some long sequence of characters, 
you just move a cursor to your choice and hit enter.  Gophers even 
let you select files and programs from ftp sites this way. 
     Let's first look at gophers (named for the official mascot of the 
University of Minnesota, where the system was developed).
     Many public-access sites now have gophers online.  To use one, type
 
          gopher
 
at the command prompt and hit enter.  If you know your site does not have 
a gopher, or if nothing happens when you type that, telnet to
 
          consultant.micro.umn.edu
 
At the log-in prompt, type
 
          gopher
 
and hit enter.  You'll be asked what type of terminal emulation you're 
using, after which you'll see something like this:
 
                    Internet Gopher Information Client v1.03                   
                                                                               
                    Root gopher server: gopher.micro.umn.edu

     Assuming you're using VT100 or some other VT emulation, you'll be 
able to move among the choices with your up and down arrow keys.  When 
you have your cursor on an entry that looks interesting, just hit enter, 
and you'll either get a new menu of choices, a database entry form, or a 
text file, depending on what the menu entry is linked to (more on how to 
tell which you'll get in a moment).
     Gophers are great for exploring the resources of the Net.  Just keep 
making choices to see what pops up.  Play with it; see where it takes 
you.  Some choices will be documents.  When you read one of these and 
either come to the end or hit a lower-case q to quit reading it, you'll 
be given the choice of saving a copy to your home directory or e-mailing 
it to yourself.  Other choices are simple databases that let you enter a 
word to look for in a particular database.  To get back to where you 
started on a gopher, hit your u key at a menu prompt, which will move you 
back "up" through the gopher menu structure (much like "cd .." in ftp).
     Notice that one of your choices above is "Internet file server (ftp) 
sites."  Choose this, and you'll be connected to a modified archie 
program -- an archie with a difference.  When you search for a file 
through a gopher archie, you'll get a menu of sites that have the file 
you're looking for, just as with the old archie.  Only now, instead of 
having to write down or remember an ftp address and directory, all you 
have to do is position the cursor next to one of the numbers in the menu 
and hit enter.  You'll be connected to the ftp site, from which you can 
then choose the file you want.  This time, move the cursor to the file 
you want and hit a lower-case s.  You'll be asked for a name in your home 
directory to use for the file, after which the file will be copied to 
your home system.  Unfortunately, this file-transfer process does not yet 
work with all public-access sites for computer programs and compressed 
files.  If it doesn't work with yours, you'll have to get the file the 
old-fashioned way, via anonymous ftp. 
     In addition to ftp sites, there are hundreds of databases and 
libraries around the world accessible through gophers.  There is not yet 
a common gopher interface for library catalogs, so be prepared to follow 
the online directions more closely when you use gopher to connect to 
one. 
     Gopher menu entries that end in a / are gateways to another menu of 
options.  Entries that end in a period are text, graphics or program 
files, which you can retrieve to your home directory (or e-mail to 
yourself or to somebody else).  A line that ends in <?> or <CSO> 
represents a request you can make to a database for information.  The 
difference is that <?> entries call up one-line interfaces in which you 
can search for a keyword or words, while <CSO> brings up an electronic 
form with several fields for you to fill out (you might see this in 
online "White Pages" directories at colleges).
     Gophers actually let you perform some relatively sophisticated 
Boolean searches.  For example, if you want to search only for files that 
contain the words "MS-DOS" and "Macintosh," you'd type

        ms-dos and macintosh

(gophers are not case-sensitive) in the keyword field.  Alternately, if 
you want to get a list of files that mention either "MS-DOS" or 
"Macintosh," you'd type

        ms-dos or macintosh


8.2  BURROWING DEEPER


     As fascinating as it can be to explore "gopherspace," you might one 
day want to quickly retrieve some information or a file.  Or you might 
grow tired of calling up endless menus to get to the one you want. 
Fortunately,  there are ways to make even gophers easier to use. 
     One is with archie's friend, veronica (it allegedly is an acronym, 
but don't believe that for a second), who does for gopherspace what 
archie does for ftp sites. 
     In most gophers, you'll find veronica by selecting "Other gopher and 
information services" at the main menu and then "Searching through 
gopherspace using veronica."  Select this and you'll get something like 
this: 

                    Internet Gopher Information Client v1.1

                  Search titles in Gopherspace using veronica

Press ? for Help, q to Quit, u to go up a menu                        Page: 1/1

     A few choices there!  First, the difference between searching 
directory titles and just plain ol' gopherspace.  If you already know the 
sort of directory you're looking for (say a directory containing MS-DOS 
programs), do a directory-title search.  But if you're not sure what kind 
of directory your information might be in, then do a general 
gopherspace search. In general, it doesn't matter which of the particular 
veronicas you use -- they should all be able to produce the same results.  
The reason there is more than one is because the Internet has become so 
popular that only one veronica (or one gopher or one of almost anything) 
would quickly be overwhelmed by all the information requests from around 
the world.  
     You can use veronica to search for almost anything.  Want to find 
museums that might have online displays from their exhibits?  Try 
searching for "museum."  Looking for a copy of the Declaration of 
Independence?  Try "declaration." 
     In many cases, your search will bring up a new gopher menu of 
choices to try.
     Say you want to impress those guests coming over for dinner on 
Friday by cooking cherries flambe. If you were to call up veronica and 
type in "flambe" after calling up veronica, you would soon get a menu 
listing several flambe recipes, including one called "dessert flambe."  
Put your cursor on that line of the menu and hit enter, and you'll find 
it's a menu for cherries flambe.  Then hit your q key to quit, and gopher 
will ask you if you want to save the file in your home directory on your 
public-access site or whether you want to e-mail it somewhere. 
     As you can see, you can use veronica as an alternative to archie, 
which, because of the Internet's growing popularity, seems to take longer 
and longer to work.
     In addition to archie and veronica, we now also have jugheads (no 
bettys yet, though).  These work the same as veronicas, but their 
searches are limited to the specific gopher systems on which they reside.
     If there are particular gopher resources you use frequently, there 
are a couple of ways to get to them even more directly.
     One is to use gopher in a manner similar to the way you can use 
telnet. If you know a particular gopher's Internet address (often the 
same as its telnet or ftp address), you can connect to it directly, 
rather than going through menus.  For example, say you want to use the 
gopher at info.umd.edu.  If your public-access site has a gopher system 
installed, type this 
           
         gopher info.umd.edu

at your command prompt and you'll be connected.
     But even that can get tedious if there are several gophers you use 
frequently. That's where bookmarks come in.  Gophers let you create a 
list of your favorite gopher sites and even database queries.  Then, 
instead of digging ever deeper into the gopher directory structure, you 
just call up your bookmark list and select the service you want.
     To create a bookmark for a particular gopher site, first call up 
gopher.  Then go through all the gopher menus until you get to the menu 
you want.  Type a capital A. You'll be given a suggested name for the 
bookmark enty, which you can change if you want by backspacing over the 
suggestion and typing in your own.  When done, hit enter.  Now, whenever 
you're in gopherspace and want to zip back to that particular gopher 
service, just hit your V key (upper- or lower-case; in this instance, 
gopher doesn't care) anywhere within gopher.  This will bring up a list 
of your bookmarks. Move to the one you want and hit enter, and you'll be 
connected. 
     Using a capital A is also good for saving particular database or 
veronica queries that you use frequently (for example, searching for 
news stories on a particular topic if your public-access site maintains 
an indexed archive of wire-service news).
    Instead of a capital A, you can also hit a lower-case a.  This will 
bring you to the particular line within a menu, rather than show you the 
entire menu.  
    If you ever want to delete a bookmark, hit V within gopher, select 
the item you want to get rid of, and then hit your D key.
    One more hint:
    If you want to find the address of a particular gopher service, hit 
your = key after you've highlighted its entry in a gopher menu.  You'll 
get back a couple of lines, most of which will be technicalese of no 
immediate value to most folks, but some of which will consist of the 
site's address.

8.5.  WIDE-AREA INFORMATION SERVERS

 
     Now you know there are hundreds of databases and library catalogs 
you can search through.  But as you look, you begin to realize that each 
seems to have its own unique method for searching.  If you connect to 
several, this can become a pain.  Gophers reduce this problem somewhat.
     Wide-area information servers promise another way to zero in on 
information hidden on the Net. In a WAIS, the user sees only one 
interface -- the program worries about how to access information on 
dozens, even hundreds, of different databases.  You tell give a WAIS a 
word and it scours the net looking for places where it's mentioned.  You 
get a menu of documents, each ranked according to how relevant to your 
search the WAIS thinks it is.
     Like gophers, WAIS "client" programs can already be found on many 
public-access Internet sites. If your system has a WAIS client, type 
 
        swais
 
at the command prompt and hit enter (the "s" stands for "simple").  If it 
doesn't, telnet to bbs.oit.unc.edu, which is run by the University of North 
Carolina  At the "login:" prompt, type 
 
               bbs
 
and hit enter.  You'll be asked to register and will then get a list of 
"bulletins,'' which are various files explaining how the system works. 
When done with those, hit your Q key and you'll get another menu.  Hit 4 
for the "simple WAIS client," and you'll see something like this:

Each line represents a different database (the .au at the end of some of 
them means they are in Australia; the .fr on the last line represents a 
database in France).  And this is just the first page!  If you type a 
capital K, you'll go to the next page (there are several pages).  
Hitting a capital J will move you back a page. 
     The first thing you want to do is tell the WAIS program which 
databases you want searched.  To select a database, move the cursor bar 
over the line you want (using your down and up arrow keys) and hit your 
space bar.  An asterisk will appear next to the line number.  Repeat this 
until you've selected all of the databases you want searched.  Then hit 
your W key, after which you'll be prompted for the key words you're 
looking for.  You can type in an entire line of these words -- separate 
each with a space, not a comma.
    Hit return, and the search begins.  
    Let's say you're utterly fascinated with wheat.  So you might select 
agricultural-market-news to find its current world price.  But you also 
want to see if it has any religious implications, so you choose the 
Bible and the Book of Mormon.  What do you do with the stuff?  Select 
recipes and usenet-cookbook. Are there any recent Supreme Court 
decisions involving the plant? Choose supreme-court.  How about synonyms? 
Try roget-thesaurus and just plain thesaurus. 
    Now hit w and type in wheat.  Hit enter, and the WAIS program begins 
its search.  As it looks, it tells you whether any of the databases are 
offline, and if so, when they might be ready for a search.  In about a 
minute, the program tells you how many hits it's found.  Then you get a new 
menu, that looks something like this:

Each of these represents an article or citing that contains the word wheat, 
or some related word.  Move the cursor bar (with the down and up arrow 
keys) to the one you want to see, hit enter, and it will begin to appear 
on your screen.  The "score" is a WAIS attempt to gauge how closely the 
citing matches your request.  Doesn't look like the Supreme Court has had 
anything to say about the plant of late!
     Now think of how much time you would have spent logging onto various 
databases just to find these relatively trivial examples. 
 

8.6  THE WORLD-WIDE WEB

 
     Developed by researchers at the European Particle Physics 
Laboratory in Geneva, the World-Wide Web is somewhat similar to a WAIS.  
But it's designed on a system known as hypertext.  Words in one document 
are "linked" to other documents.  It's sort of like sitting with an 
encyclopedia -- you're reading an article, see a reference that 
intrigues you and so flip the pages to look up that reference.

8.7. CLIENTS, OR HOW TO SNARE MORE ON THE WEB


     If you are used to plain-vanilla Unix or MS-DOS, then the way these 
gophers and WAISs work seems quite straightforward.  But if you're used 
to a computer with a graphical interface, such as a Macintosh, an IBM 
compatible with Windows or a Next, you'll probably regard their 
interfaces as somewhat primitive. And even to a veteran MS-DOS user, the 
World-Wide Web interface is rather clunky (and some of the documents and 
files on the Web now use special formatting that would confuse your poor 
computer). 
     There are, however, ways to integrate these services into your 
graphical user interface.  In fact, there are now ways to tie into the 
Internet directly, rather than relying on whatever interface your 
public-access system uses, through what are known as "client" programs.  
These programs provide graphical interfaces for everything from ftp to 
the World-Wide Web.  
     There is now a growing number of these "client" programs for 
everything from ftp to gopher.  PSI of Reston, Va., which offers 
nationwide Internet access, in fact, requires its customers to use these 
programs. Using protocols known as SLIP and PPP, these programs 
communicate with the Net using the same basic data packets as much larger 
computers online. 
     Beyond integration with your own computer's "desktop,'' client 
programs let you do more than one thing at once on the net -- while you're 
downloading a large file in one window, you can be chatting with a 
friend through an Internet chat program in another.
     Unfortunately, using a client program can cost a lot of money.  Some 
require you to be connected directly to the Internet through an Ethernet 
network for example.  Others work through modem protocols, such as SLIP, 
but public-access sites that allow such access may charge anywhere from 
$25 to $200 a month extra for the service.
     Your system administrator can give you more information on setting 
up one of these connections.


8.8.  WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

     As the Internet grows ever more popular, its resources come under 
more of a strain.  If you try to use gopher in the middle of the day, at 
least on the East Coast of the U.S., you'll sometimes notice that it 
takes a very long time for particular menus or database searches to come 
up.  Sometimes, you'll even get a message that there are too many people 
connected to whichever service you're trying to use and so you can't get 
in.  The only alternative is to either try again in 20 minutes or so, or 
wait until later in the day, when the load might be lower.  When this 
happens in veronica, try one of the other veronica entries.
     When you retrieve a file through gopher, you'll sometimes be asked 
if you want to store it under some ludicrously long name (there go our 
friends the system administrators again, using 128 characters just 
because Unix lets them).  With certain MS-DOS communications programs, if 
that name is longer than one line, you won't be able to backspace all the 
way back to the first line if you want to give it a simpler name.  
Backspace as far as you can.  Then, when you get ready to download it to 
your home computer, remember that the file name will be truncated on your 
end, because of MS-DOS's file-naming limitations.  Worse, your computer
might even reject the whole thing. What to do? Instead of saving it to
your home directory, mail it to yourself.  It should show up in your mail
by the time you exit gopher.  Then, use your mail command for saving it
to your home directory -- at which point you can name it anything you want.
Now you can download it.


8.9 FYI
 

     David Riggins maintains a list of gophers by type and category. You 
can find the most recent one at the ftp site ftp.einet.net, in the pub 
directory.  Look for a file with a name like "gopher-jewels.txt." 
Alternately, you can get on a mailing list to get the latest version sent 
to your e-mailbox automatically. Send a mail message to gopherjewelslist-
request@tpis.cactus.org (yep, that first part is all one word).  Leave 
the "subject:" line blank, and as a message, write SUBSCRIBE. 
     Blake Gumprecht maintains a list of gopher and telnet sites related 
to, or run by, the government. He posts it every three weeks to the 
news.answers and soc.answers newsgroups on Usenet. It can also be 
obtained via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu, as 
/pub/usenet/news.answers/us-govt-net-pointers. 
     Students at the University of Michigan's School of Information and 
Library Studies, recently compiled separate lists of Internet resources 
in 11 specific areas, from aeronautics to theater.  They can be obtained 
via gopher at gopher.lib.umich.edu, in the "What's New and Featured 
Resources" menu.
     The Usenet newsgroups comp.infosystems.gopher and 
comp.infosystems.wais are places to go for technical discussions about 
gophers and WAISs respectively.
     The Interpedia project is an attempt to take gopher one step 
further, by creating an online repository of all of the interesting and 
useful information availble on the Net and from its users. To get on the 
mailing list for the project, send an e-mail message, with a "subject:" 
of "subscribe" to interpedia-request@telerama.lm.com.  You can get 
supporting documentation for the project via anonymous ftp at ftp.lm.com 
in the pub/interpedia directory.






Chapter 9: ADVANCED E-MAIL
 
 
 
9.1  THE FILE'S IN THE MAIL


     E-mail by itself is a powerful tool, and by now you may be 
sending e-mail messages all over the place.  You might even be on a 
mailing list or two. But there is a lot more to e-mail than just 
sending messages.  If your host system does not have access to ftp, 
or it doesn't have access to every ftp site on the Net, you can have 
programs and files sent right to your mailbox.  And using some simple 
techniques, you can use e-mail to send data files such as spreadsheets, 
or even whole programs, to friends and colleagues around the world. 
     A key to both is a set of programs known as encoders and 
decoders.  For all its basic power, Net e-mail has a big problem: it 
can't handle graphics characters or the control codes found in even 
the simplest of computer programs. Encoders however, can translate 
these into forms usable in e-mail, while decoders turn them back into 
a form that you can actually use. If you are using a Unix-based host 
system, chances are it already has an encoder and decoder online that 
you can use. These programs will also let you use programs posted in 
several Usenet newsgroups, such as comp.binaries.ibm.pc. 
    If both you and the person with whom you want to exchange files use 
Unix host systems, you're in luck because virtually all Unix 
host systems have encoder/decoder programs online.  For now, let's 
assume that's the case. First, upload the file you want to send to your 
friend to your host site (ask your system administrator how to upload a 
file to your name or "home" directory if you don't already know how).  
Then type 
 
                uuencode file file > file.uu
 
and hit enter. "File" is the name of the file you want to prepare for 
mailing, and yes, you have to type the name twice!  The > is a Unix 
command that tells the system to call the "encoded" file "file.uu" 
(you could actually call it anything you want). 
     Now to get it into a mail message.  The quick and dirty way is to 
type 
 
                mail friend
 
where "friend" is your friend's address.  At the subject line, tell 
her the name of the enclosed file.  When you get the blank line, type 
 
                ~r file.uu
 
or whatever you called the file, and hit enter. (on some systems, the ~ 
may not work; if so, ask your system administrator what to use).  This 
inserts the file into your mail message.  Hit control-D, and your file 
is on its way! 
     On the other end, when your friend goes into her mailbox,  she 
should transfer it to her home directory.  Then she should type 
 
                uudecode file.name
 
and hit enter.  This creates a new file in her name directory with 
whatever name you originally gave it.  She can then download it to her 
own computer.  Before she can actually use it, though, she'll have to 
open it up with a text processor and delete the mail header that has 
been "stamped" on it.  If you use a mailer program that automatically 
appends a "signature," tell her about that so she can delete that as 
well. 


9.2  RECEIVING FILES


    If somebody sends you a file through the mail, you'll have to go 
through a couple of steps to get it into a form you can actually use.  If 
you are using the simple mail program, go into mail and type 
 
                w # file.name
 
where # is the number of the message you want to transfer and 
file.name is what you want to call the resulting file.  In pine, call 
up the message and hit your O key and then E.  You'll then be asked 
for a file name. In elm, call up the message and hit your S key.  
You'll get something that looks like this: 
 
                =file.request
 
     Type a new file name and hit enter (if you hit enter without 
typing a file name, the message will be saved to another mail folder, 
not your home directory). 
    In all three cases, exit the mail program to return to your host 
system's command line. Because the file has been encoded for mail 
delivery, you now have to run a decoder.  At the command line, type 
 
                uudecode file.name
 
where file.name is the file you created while in mail. Uudecode will 
create a new, uncompressed binary file.  In some cases, you may have to 
run it through some other programs (for example, if it is in "tar" form), 
but generally it should now be ready for you to download to your own 
computer (on which you might then have to run a de-compressor program 
such as PKXZIP).
     

9.3  FILES TO NON-INTERNET SITES
                                  

    What if your friend only connects with a non-Unix system, such as 
CompuServe or MCIMail?  There are programs available for MS-DOS, Apple 
and Amiga computers that will encode and decode files.  Of course, since 
you can't send one of these programs to your friend via e-mail (how would 
she un-encode it?), you'll have to mail (the old-fashioned way) or give 
her a diskette with the program on it first.   Then, she can get the file 
by e-mail and go through the above process (only on her own computer) to 
get a usable file.  Remember to give her an encoder program as well, if 
she wants to send you files in return. 
     For MS-DOS machines, you'll want to get uunecode.com and 
uudecode.com.  Both can be found through anonymous ftp at 
wuarchive.wustl.edu in the /mirrors/msdos/starter directory. The MS-
DOS version is as easy to use as the Unix one: Just type 
 
                uudecode filename.ext
 
and hit enter.
     Mac users should get a program called uutool, which can be found 
in the info-mac/util directory on sumex-aim.stanford.edu. 
     Think twice before sending somebody a giant file. Although large 
sites connected directly to the Internet can probably handle mega-files, 
many smaller systems cannot. Some commercial systems, such as CompuServe 
and MCIMail, limit the size of mail messages their users can receive.  
Fidonet doesn't even allow encoded messages.  In general, a file size of 
30,000 or so bytes is a safe upper limit for non-Internet systems. 


9.4  GETTING FTP FILES VIA E-MAIL


    To help people without ftp access, a number of ftp sites have set up 
mail servers (also known as archive servers) that allow you to get files 
via e-mail.  You send a request to one of these machines and they send 
back the file you want.  As with ftp, you'll be able to find everything 
from historical documents to software (but please note that if you do 
have access to ftp, that method is always quicker and ties up fewer 
resources than using e-mail). 
      Some interesting or useful mail servers include:
      mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu  Files of "frequently asked questions" 
related to Usenet; state-by-state lists of U.S. representatives and 
Senators and their addresses and office phone numbers. 
      archive-server@eff.org  Information about the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation; documents about legal issues on the Net. 
      archive-server@cs.widener.edu  Back copies of the Computer 
Underground Digest and every possible fact you could want to know about 
"The Simpsons." 
      netlib@uunet.uu.net  Programs for many types of personal computers;

      Most mail servers work pretty much the same -- you send an e-mail 
message that tells them what file you want and how you want it sent to 
you.  The most important command is "send," which tells the computer you 
want it to send you a particular file. 
     First, though, you'll need to know where the mail server stores 
that file, because you have to tell it which directory or sub-
directory it's in.  There are a couple of ways to do this. You can 
send an e-mail message to the archive-server that consists of one 
line: 
 
                index
 
     The server will then send you a directory listing of its main, or 
root directory.  You'll then have to send a second message to the 
archive server with one line: 
 
                index directory/subdirectory
 
where that is the directory or directory path for which you want a 
listing.  An alternative is to send an e-mail message to our old 
friend archie, which should send you back the file's exact location on 
the archive-server (along with similar listings for all the other 
sites that may have the file, however)
     Once you have the file name and its directory path, compose a 
message to the archive server like this:
 
                send directory/subdirectory/file 
  
     Send off the message and, anywhere from a few minutes to a couple 
of days later, you'll find a new message in your mailbox: a copy of the 
file you requested.  The exact time it will take a file to get to you 
depends on a variety of factors, including how many requests are in line 
before yours (mail servers can only process so many requests at a time) 
and the state of the connections between the server and you. 
     Seems simple enough. It gets a little more complicated when you 
request a program rather than a document.  Programs or other files that 
contain unusual characters or lines longer than 130 characters (graphics 
files, for example) require special processing by both the mail server 
to ensure they are transmitted via e-mail.  Then you'll have to run them 
through at least one converter program to put them in a form you can 
actually use.  To ensure that a program or other "non-mailable" file 
actually gets to you, include another line in your e-mail message to the 
server: 
                                            
                encoder                      
 
This converts the file into an encoded form.  To decode it, you'll 
first have to transfer the file message into a file in your home 
directory.  
     One further complication comes when you request a particularly 
long file.  Many Net sites can only handle so much mail at a time.  To 
make sure you get the entire file, tell the mail server to break it up 
into smaller pieces, with another line in your e-mail request like 
this: 
 
                size 100000
 
     This gives the mail server the maximum size, in bytes, of each 
file segment.  This particular size is good for UUCP sites. Internet 
and Bitnet sites can generally go up to 300000.  When you get all of 
these files in mail, transfer them to your home directory.  Exit mail 
and call up each file in your host system's text processor and delete 
each one's entire header and footer (or "signature" at the end).  When 
done with this, at your host system's command line, type 
 
                cat file1 file2 > bigfile
 
where file1 is the first file, file2 the second file, and so on.  The > 
tells your host system to combine them into a new megafile called 
bigfile (or whatever you want to call it).  After you save the file to 
your home directory (see section 9.2 above), you can then run uudecode, 
tar, etc. One word of caution, though: if the file you want is long 
enough that it has to be broken into pieces, think of how much time it's 
going to take you to download the whole thing -- especially if you're 
using a 2400-baud modem! 
     There are a number of other mail servers.  To get a list, send an 
e-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu: 
 
send usenet/comp.sources.wanted/How_to_find_sources_(READ_THIS_BEFORE_POSTING)
 
     You'll have to spell it exactly as listed above.  Some mail 
servers use different software, which will require slightly different 
commands than the ones listed here.  In general, if you send a message 
to a mail server that says only 
 
                help
 
you should get back a file detailing all of its commands. 
     But what if the file you want is not on one of these mail 
servers?  That's where ftpmail comes in.  Run by Digital Equipment 
Corp. in California, this service can connect to almost any ftp site 
in the world, get the file you want and then mail it to you. Using it 
is fairly simple -- you send an e-mail message to ftpmail that 
includes a series of commands telling the system where to find the 
file you want and how to format it to mail to you. 
     Compose an e-mail message to
 
                ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
 
     Leave the "subject:" line blank.  Inside the message, there are 
several commands you can give.  The first line should be 
 
                reply address
 
where "address" is your e-mail address. The next line should be 
 
                connect host
 
where "host" is the system that has the file you want (for example: 
wuarchive.wustl.edu). Other commands you should consider using are 
"binary" (required for program files); "compress" (reduces the file 
size for quicker transmission) and "uuencode" (which encodes the file 
so you can do something with it when it arrives).  The last line of 
your message should be the word "quit".  
     Let's say you want a copy of the U.S. constitution.  Using archie, 
you've found a file called, surprise, constitution, at the ftp site 
archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, in the /pub/firearms/politics/rkba 
directory. You'd send a message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com that looks 
like this: 
 
                reply adamg@world.std.com
                connect archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
                binary
                compress
                uuencode
                get pub/firearms/politics/rkba/constitution
                quit
 
     When you get the file in your mailbox, use the above procedure 
for copying it to a file.  Run it through uudecode.  Then type 
 
                uncompress file.name
 
to make it usable.
     Since this was a text file, you could have changed the "binary" to 
"ascii" and then eliminated the "uuencode" file.  For programs, though, 
you'll want to keep these lines.  One caveat with ftpmail: it has become 
such a popular service that it could take a week or more for your 
requested files to arrive.
 

9.5  THE ALL KNOWING ORACLE


      One other thing you can do through e-mail is consult with the 
Usenet Oracle.  You can ask the Oracle anything at all and get back an 
answer (whether you like the answer is another question). 
      First, you'll want to get instructions on how to address the Oracle 
(he, or she, or it, is very particular about such things and likes being 
addressed in august, solemn and particularly sycophantic tones).  Start 
an e-mail message to 
 
                oracle@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu 
 
      In the "subject:" line, type 
 
                help 
  
and hit enter.  You don't actually have to say anything in the message 
itself -- at least not yet.  Hit control-D to send off your request 
for help.  Within a few hours, the Oracle will mail you back detailed 
instructions.  It's a fairly long file, so before you start reading 
it, turn on your communications software's logging function, to save 
it to your computer (or save the message to a file on your host system's 
home directory and then download the file).  After you've digested it, 
you can compose your question to the Oracle.  Mail it to the above 
address, only this time with a subject line that describes your 
question.  Expect an answer within a couple of days. And don't be 
surprised if you also find a question in your mailbox -- the Oracle 
extracts payment by making seekers of knowledge answer questions as 
well!





Chapter 10: NEWS OF THE WORLD
 


     
10.1   Clarinet: UPI, Dave Barry and Dilbert.

 
     Usenet "newsgroups" can be something of a misnomer.  They may be 
interesting, informative and educational, but they are often not news, 
at least, not the way most people would think of them. But there are several 
sources of news and sports on the Net.  
     One of the largest is Clarinet, a company in Cupertino, Calf., that 
distributes wire-service news and columns, along with a news service 
devoted to computers and even the Dilbert comic strip, in Usenet form.  
     Distributed in Usenet form, Clarinet stories and columns are 
organized into more than 100 newsgroups (in this case, a truly 
appropriate name), some of them with an extremely narrow focus, for 
example, clari.news.gov.taxes.  The general news and sports come from 
United Press International; the computer news from the NewsBytes 
service; the features from several syndicates. 
     Because Clarinet charges for its service, not all host systems 
carry its articles. Those that do carry them as Usenet groups starting 
with "clari."  As with other Usenet hierarchies, these are named starting 
with broad area and ending with more specific categories.  Some of these 
include business news (clari.biz); general national and foreign news, 
politics and the like (clari.news), sports (clari.sports); columns by 
Mike Royko, Miss Manners, Dave Barry and others (clari.feature); and 
NewsBytes computer and telecommunications reports (clari.nb).  Because 
Clarinet started in Canada, there is a separate set of clari.canada 
newsgroups.  The clari.nb newsgroups are divided into specific computer 
types (clari.nb.apple, for example). 
     Clari news groups feature stories updated around the clock.  There 
are even a couple of "bulletin" newsgroups for breaking stories: 
clari.news.bulletin and clari.news.urgent.  Clarinet also sets up new 
newsgroups for breaking stories that become ongoing ones (such as major 
natural disasters, coups in large countries and the like). 
     Occasionally, you will see stories in clari newsgroups that just 
don't seem to belong there.  Stories about former Washington, D.C. mayor 
Marion Barry, for example, often wind interspersed among columns by Dave 
Barry.
     This happens because of the way wire services work.  UPI uses 
three-letter codes to route its stories to the newspapers and radio 
stations that make up most of its clientele, and harried editors on 
deadline sometimes punch in the wrong code.
 

10.2  REUTERS

     This is roughly the British equivalent of UPI or Associated Press. 
Msen, a public-access site in Michigan, currently feeds Reuters 
dispatches into a series of Usenet-style conferences.  If your site 
subscribes to this service, look for newsgroups with names that begin in 
msen.reuters.


10.3  USA TODAY
 
     If your host system doesn't carry the clari or msen.reuters 
newsgroups, you might be able to keep up with the news a different way 
over the Net.  USA Today has been something of an online newspaper 
pioneer, selling its stories to bulletin-board and online systems across 
the country for several years.  Cleveland Free-Net provides the online 
version of USA Today (along with all its other services) for free.  
Currently, the paper only publishes five days a week, so you'll have to 
get your weekend news fix elsewhere. 
 
          Telnet: freenet-in-a.cwru.edu or
                  freenet-in-b.cwru.edu
 
     After you connect and log in, look for this menu entry: NPTN/USA 
TODAY HEADLINE NEWS.  Type the number next to it and hit enter.  You'll 
then get a menu listing a series of broad categories, such as sports and 
telecommunications.  Choose one, and you'll get a yet another menu, 
listing the ten most recent dates of publication.  Each of these 
contains one-paragraph summaries of the day's news in that particular 
subject.
 
 
10.4  THE WORLD TODAY, FROM BELARUS TO BRAZIL
 

     Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are American radio stations 
that broadcast to the former Communist countries of eastern Europe.  
Every day, their news departments prepare a summary of news in those 
countries, which is then disseminated via the Net, through a Bitnet 
mailing list and a Usenet newsgroup.
     To have the daily digests sent directly to your e-mailbox, send a 
message to 
          
          listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
 
Leave the subject line blank, and as a message, write:
 
          subscribe rferl-l Your Name

Alternately, look for the bulletins in the Usenet newsgroup misc.news-
east-europe.rferl.
     Daily Brazilian news updates are available (in Portuguese) from the 
University of Sao Paulo.  Use anonymous ftp to connect to
 
          uspif.if.usp.br
 
Use cd to switch to the whois directory.  The news summaries are stored 
in files with this form: NEWS.23OCT92;1.  But to get them, leave off the 
semicolon and the 1, and don't capitalize anything, for example:
 
          get news.23oct92
 
     Daily summaries of news reports from France (in French) are availble 
on the National Capital FreeNet in Ottawa, Ont. Telnet to 

          freenet.carleton.ca

and log on as: guest.  At the main menu, select the number for "The 
Newsstand" and then "La presse de France."
     

10.5  E-MAILING NEWS ORGANIZATIONS


     A number of newspapers, television stations and networks and other 
news organizations now encourage readers and viewers to communicate with 
them electronically, via Internet e-mail addresses.  They include:

     The Middlesex News, Framingham, Mass.  sysop@news.ci.net
     The Boston Globe                       voxbox@globe.com
     WCVB-TV, Boston, Mass.                 wcvb@aol.com
     NBC News, New York, N.Y.               nightly@nbc.com
     The Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa, Ont.       ottawa-citizen@freenet.carleton.ca
     CJOH-TV, Ottawa, Ont.                  ab363@freenet.carleton.ca
     St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times            73174.3344@compuserve.com
     Illinois Issues, Springfield, Ill.     gherardi@sangamon.edu
     WTVF-TV, Nashville, Tenn.              craig.ownsby@nashville.com


10.6  FYI
 
     The clari.net.newusers newsgroup on Usenet provides a number of 
articles about Clarinet and ways of finding news stories of interest 
to you.
     To discuss the future of newspapers and newsrooms in the new 
electronic medium, subscribe to the Computer Assisted Reporting and 
Research mailing list on Bitnet.  Send a mail message of

Chapter 9: ADVANCED E-MAIL
 
 
 
9.1  THE FILE'S IN THE MAIL


     E-mail by itself is a powerful tool, and by now you may be 
sending e-mail messages all over the place.  You might even be on a 
mailing list or two. But there is a lot more to e-mail than just 
sending messages.  If your host system does not have access to ftp, 
or it doesn't have access to every ftp site on the Net, you can have 
programs and files sent right to your mailbox.  And using some simple 
techniques, you can use e-mail to send data files such as spreadsheets, 
or even whole programs, to friends and colleagues around the world. 
     A key to both is a set of programs known as encoders and 
decoders.  For all its basic power, Net e-mail has a big problem: it 
can't handle graphics characters or the control codes found in even 
the simplest of computer programs. Encoders however, can translate 
these into forms usable in e-mail, while decoders turn them back into 
a form that you can actually use. If you are using a Unix-based host 
system, chances are it already has an encoder and decoder online that 
you can use. These programs will also let you use programs posted in 
several Usenet newsgroups, such as comp.binaries.ibm.pc. 
    If both you and the person with whom you want to exchange files use 
Unix host systems, you're in luck because virtually all Unix 
host systems have encoder/decoder programs online.  For now, let's 
assume that's the case. First, upload the file you want to send to your 
friend to your host site (ask your system administrator how to upload a 
file to your name or "home" directory if you don't already know how).  
Then type 
 
                uuencode file file > file.uu
 
and hit enter. "File" is the name of the file you want to prepare for 
mailing, and yes, you have to type the name twice!  The > is a Unix 
command that tells the system to call the "encoded" file "file.uu" 
(you could actually call it anything you want). 
     Now to get it into a mail message.  The quick and dirty way is to 
type 
 
                mail friend
 
where "friend" is your friend's address.  At the subject line, type
the name of the enclosed file.  When you get the blank line, type 
 
                ~r file.uu
 
or whatever you called the file, and hit enter. (on some systems, the ~ 
may not work; if so, ask your system administrator what to use).  This 
inserts the file into your mail message.  Hit control-D, and your file 
is on its way! 
     On the other end, when your friend goes into her mailbox,  she 
should transfer it to her home directory.  Then she should type 
 
                uudecode file.name
 
and hit enter.  This creates a new file in her name directory with 
whatever name you originally gave it.  She can then download it to her 
own computer.  Before she can actually use it, though, she'll have to 
open it up with a text processor and delete the mail header that has 
been "stamped" on it.  If you use a mailer program that automatically 
appends a "signature," tell her about that so she can delete that as 
well. 


9.2  RECEIVING FILES


    If somebody sends you a file through the mail, you'll have to go 
through a couple of steps to get it into a form you can actually use.  If 
you are using the simple mail program, go into mail and type 
 
                w # file.name
 
where # is the number of the message you want to transfer and 
file.name is what you want to call the resulting file.  In pine, call 
up the message and hit your O key and then E.  You'll then be asked 
for a file name. In elm, call up the message and hit your S key.  
You'll get something that looks like this: 
 
                =file.request
 
     Type a new file name and hit enter (if you hit enter without 
typing a file name, the message will be saved to another mail folder, 
not your home directory). 
    In all three cases, exit the mail program to return to your host 
system's command line. Because the file has been encoded for mail 
delivery, you now have to run a decoder.  At the command line, type 
 
                uudecode file.name
 
where file.name is the file you created while in mail. Uudecode will 
create a new, uncompressed binary file.  In some cases, you may have to 
run it through some other programs (for example, if it is in "tar" form), 
but generally it should now be ready for you to download to your own 
computer (on which you might then have to run a de-compressor program 
such as PKXZIP).
     

9.3  SENDING FILES TO NON-INTERNET SITES
                                  

    What if your friend only connects with a non-Unix system, such as 
CompuServe or MCIMail?  There are programs available for MS-DOS, Apple 
and Amiga computers that will encode and decode files.  Of course, since 
you can't send one of these programs to your friend via e-mail (how would 
she un-encode it?), you'll have to mail (the old-fashioned way) or give 
her a diskette with the program on it first.   Then, she can get the file 
by e-mail and go through the above process (only on her own computer) to 
get a usable file.  Remember to give her an encoder program as well, if 
she wants to send you files in return. 
     For MS-DOS machines, you'll want to get uunecode.com and 
uudecode.com.  Both can be found through anonymous ftp at 
wuarchive.wustl.edu in the /mirrors/msdos/starter directory. The MS-
DOS version is as easy to use as the Unix one: Just type 
 
                uudecode filename.ext
 
and hit enter.
     Mac users should get a program called uutool, which can be found 
in the info-mac/util directory on sumex-aim.stanford.edu. 
     Think twice before sending somebody a giant file. Although large 
sites connected directly to the Internet can probably handle mega-files, 
many smaller systems cannot. Some commercial systems, such as CompuServe 
and MCIMail, limit the size of mail messages their users can receive.  
Fidonet doesn't even allow encoded messages.  In general, a file size of 
30,000 or so bytes is a safe upper limit for non-Internet systems. 


9.4  GETTING FTP FILES VIA E-MAIL


    To help people without ftp access, a number of ftp sites have set up 
mail servers (also known as archive servers) that allow you to get files 
via e-mail.  You send a request to one of these machines and they send 
back the file you want.  As with ftp, you'll be able to find everything 
from historical documents to software (but please note that if you do 
have access to ftp, that method is always quicker and ties up fewer 
resources than using e-mail). 
      Some interesting or useful mail servers include:
      mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu  Files of "frequently asked questions" 
related to Usenet; state-by-state lists of U.S. representatives and 
Senators and their addresses and office phone numbers. 
      archive-server@eff.org  Information about the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation; documents about legal issues on the Net. 
      archive-server@cs.widener.edu  Back copies of the Computer 
Underground Digest and every possible fact you could want to know about 
"The Simpsons." 
      netlib@uunet.uu.net  Programs for many types of personal computers; 
archives of past postings from many Usenet newsgroups. 
      archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov  Space-related text and graphics 
(GIF-format) files. 
      service@nic.ddn.mil  Detailed information about Internet. 
      Most mail servers work pretty much the same -- you send an e-mail 
message that tells them what file you want and how you want it sent to 
you.  The most important command is "send," which tells the computer you 
want it to send you a particular file. 
     First, though, you'll need to know where the mail server stores 
that file, because you have to tell it which directory or sub-
directory it's in.  There are a couple of ways to do this. You can 
send an e-mail message to the archive-server that consists of one 
line: 
 
                index
 
     The server will then send you a directory listing of its main, or 
root directory.  You'll then have to send a second message to the 
archive server with one line: 
 
                index directory/subdirectory
 
where directory/subdirectory is the directory path for which you want a 
listing.  An alternative is to send an e-mail message to our old friend 
archie, which should send you back the file's exact location on the 
archive-server (along with similar listings for all the other sites that 
may have the file, however) 
     Once you have the file name and its directory path, compose a 
message to the archive server like this:
 
                send directory/subdirectory/file 
  
     Send off the message and, anywhere from a few minutes to a couple 
of days later, you'll find a new message in your mailbox: a copy of the 
file you requested.  The exact time it will take a file to get to you 
depends on a variety of factors, including how many requests are in line 
before yours (mail servers can only process so many requests at a time) 
and the state of the connections between the server and you. 
     Seems simple enough. It gets a little more complicated when you 
request a program rather than a document.  Programs or other files that 
contain unusual characters or lines longer than 130 characters (graphics 
files, for example) require special processing by the mail server to 
ensure they are transmitted via e-mail.  Then you'll have to run them 
through at least one converter program to put them in a form you can 
actually use.  To ensure that a program or other "non-mailable" file 
actually gets to you, include another line in your e-mail message to the 
server: 
                                            
                encoder                      
 
This converts the file into an encoded form.  To decode it, you'll 
first have to transfer the file message into a file in your home 
directory.  
     One further complication comes when you request a particularly 
long file.  Many Net sites can only handle so much mail at a time.  To 
make sure you get the entire file, tell the mail server to break it up 
into smaller pieces, with another line in your e-mail request like 
this: 
 
                size 100000
 
     This gives the mail server the maximum size, in bytes, of each 
file segment.  This particular size is good for UUCP sites. Internet 
and Bitnet sites can generally go up to 300000.  When you get all of 
these files in mail, transfer them to your home directory.  Exit mail 
and call up each file in your host system's text processor and delete 
each one's entire header and footer (or "signature" at the end).  When 
done with this, at your host system's command line, type 
 
                cat file1 file2 > bigfile
 
where file1 is the first file, file2 the second file, and so on.  The > 
tells your host system to combine them into a new megafile called 
bigfile (or whatever you want to call it).  After you save the file to 
your home directory (see section 9.2 above), you can then run uudecode, 
tar, etc. One word of caution, though: if the file you want is long 
enough that it has to be broken into pieces, think of how much time it's 
going to take you to download the whole thing -- especially if you're 
using a 2400-baud modem! 
     There are a number of other mail servers.  To get a list, send an 
e-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu: 
 
send usenet/comp.sources.wanted/How_to_find_sources_(READ_THIS_BEFORE_POSTING)
 
     You'll have to spell it exactly as listed above.  Some mail 
servers use different software, which will require slightly different 
commands than the ones listed here.  In general, if you send a message 
to a mail server that says only 
 
                help
 
you should get back a file detailing all of its commands. 
     But what if the file you want is not on one of these mail 
servers?  That's where ftpmail comes in.  Run by Digital Equipment 
Corp. in California, this service can connect to almost any ftp site 
in the world, get the file you want and then mail it to you. Using it 
is fairly simple -- you send an e-mail message to ftpmail that 
includes a series of commands telling the system where to find the 
file you want and how to format it to mail to you. 
     Compose an e-mail message to
 
                ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
 
     Leave the "subject:" line blank.  Inside the message, there are 
several commands you can give.  The first line should be 
 
                reply address
 
where "address" is your e-mail address. The next line should be 
 
                connect host
 
where "host" is the system that has the file you want (for example: 
wuarchive.wustl.edu). Other commands you should consider using are 
"binary" (required for program files); "compress" (reduces the file 
size for quicker transmission) and "uuencode" (which encodes the file 
so you can do something with it when it arrives).  The last line of 
your message should be the word "quit".  
     Let's say you want a copy of the U.S. constitution.  Using archie, 
you've found a file called, surprise, constitution, at the ftp site 
archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, in the /pub/firearms/politics/rkba 
directory. You'd send a message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com that looks 
like this: 
 
                reply adamg@world.std.com
                connect archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
                binary
                compress
                uuencode
                get pub/firearms/politics/rkba/constitution
                quit
 
     When you get the file in your mailbox, use the above procedure 
for copying it to a file.  Run it through uudecode.  Then type 
 
                uncompress file.name
 
to make it usable.
     Since this was a text file, you could have changed the "binary" to 
"ascii" and then eliminated the "uuencode" file.  For programs, though, 
you'll want to keep these lines.  One caveat with ftpmail: it has become 
such a popular service that it could take a week or more for your 
requested files to arrive.
 

9.5  THE ALL KNOWING ORACLE


      One other thing you can do through e-mail is consult with the 
Usenet Oracle.  You can ask the Oracle anything at all and get back an 
answer (whether you'll like the answer is another question). 
      First, you'll want to get instructions on how to address the Oracle 
(he, or she, or it, is very particular about such things and likes being 
addressed in august, solemn and particularly sycophantic tones).  Start 
an e-mail message to 
 
                oracle@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu 
 
      In the "subject:" line, type 
 
                help 
  
and hit enter.  You don't actually have to say anything in the message 
itself -- at least not yet.  Hit control-D to send off your request 
for help.  Within a few hours, the Oracle will mail you back detailed 
instructions.  It's a fairly long file, so before you start reading 
it, turn on your communications software's logging function, to save 
it to your computer (or save the message to a file on your host system's 
home directory and then download the file).  After you've digested it, 
you can compose your question to the Oracle.  Mail it to the above 
address, only this time with a subject line that describes your 
question.  Expect an answer within a couple of days. And don't be 
surprised if you also find a question in your mailbox -- the Oracle 
extracts payment by making seekers of knowledge answer questions as 
well!





Chapter 10: NEWS OF THE WORLD
 


     
10.1   Clarinet: UPI, Dave Barry and Dilbert.

 
     Usenet "newsgroups" can be something of a misnomer.  They may be 
interesting, informative and educational, but they are often not news, 
at least, not the way most people would think of them. But there are several 
sources of news and sports on the Net.  
     One of the largest is Clarinet, a company in Cupertino, Calf., that 
distributes wire-service news and columns, along with a news service 
devoted to computers and even the Dilbert comic strip, in Usenet form.  
     Distributed in Usenet form, Clarinet stories and columns are 
organized into more than 100 newsgroups (in this case, a truly 
appropriate name), some of them with an extremely narrow focus, for 
example, clari.news.gov.taxes.  The general news and sports come from 
United Press International; the computer news from the NewsBytes 
service; the features from several syndicates. 
     Because Clarinet charges for its service, not all host systems 
carry its articles. Those that do carry them as Usenet groups starting 
with "clari."  As with other Usenet hierarchies, these are named starting 
with broad area and ending with more specific categories.  Some of these 
include business news (clari.biz); general national and foreign news, 
politics and the like (clari.news), sports (clari.sports); columns by 
Mike Royko, Miss Manners, Dave Barry and others (clari.feature); and 
NewsBytes computer and telecommunications reports (clari.nb).  Because 
Clarinet started in Canada, there is a separate set of clari.canada 
newsgroups.  The clari.nb newsgroups are divided into specific computer 
types (clari.nb.apple, for example). 
     Clari news groups feature stories updated around the clock.  There 
are even a couple of "bulletin" newsgroups for breaking stories: 
clari.news.bulletin and clari.news.urgent.  Clarinet also sets up new 
newsgroups for breaking stories that become ongoing ones (such as major 
natural disasters, coups in large countries and the like). 
     Occasionally, you will see stories in clari newsgroups that just 
don't seem to belong there.  Stories about former Washington, D.C. mayor 
Marion Barry, for example, often wind interspersed among columns by Dave 
Barry. This happens because of the way wire services work.  UPI uses 
three-letter codes to route its stories to the newspapers and radio 
stations that make up most of its clientele, and harried editors on 
deadline sometimes punch in the wrong code. 
 

10.2  REUTERS

     This is roughly the British equivalent of UPI or Associated Press. 
Msen, a public-access site in Michigan, currently feeds Reuters 
dispatches into a series of Usenet-style conferences.  If your site 
subscribes to this service, look for newsgroups with names that begin in 
msen.reuters.


10.3  USA TODAY
 
     If your host system doesn't carry the clari or msen.reuters 
newsgroups, you might be able to keep up with the news a different way 
over the Net.  USA Today has been something of an online newspaper 
pioneer, selling its stories to bulletin-board and online systems across 
the country for several years.  Cleveland Free-Net provides the online 
version of USA Today (along with all its other services) for free.  
Currently, the paper publishes only five days a week, so you'll have to 
get your weekend news fix elsewhere. 
 
          Telnet: freenet-in-a.cwru.edu or
                  freenet-in-b.cwru.edu or
                  freenet-in-c.cwru.edu

     After you connect and log in, look for this menu entry: NPTN/USA 
TODAY HEADLINE NEWS.  Type the number next to it and hit enter.  You'll 
then get a menu listing a series of broad categories, such as sports and 
telecommunications.  Choose one, and you'll get a yet another menu, 
listing the ten most recent dates of publication.  Each of these 
contains one-paragraph summaries of the day's news in that particular 
subject.
 
10.4  NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO

     Look in the alt.radio.networks.npr newsgroup in Usenet for summaries 
of NPR news shows such as "All Things Considered."  This newsgroup is 
also a place to discuss the network and its shows, personalities and 
policies.
 
10.5  THE WORLD TODAY, FROM BELARUS TO BRAZIL
 

     Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are American radio stations 
that broadcast to the former Communist countries of eastern Europe.  
Every day, their news departments prepare a summary of news in those 
countries, which is then disseminated via the Net, through a Bitnet 
mailing list and a Usenet newsgroup.
     To have the daily digests sent directly to your e-mailbox, send a 
message to 
          
          listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
 
Leave the subject line blank, and as a message, write:
 
          subscribe rferl-l Your Name

Alternately, look for the bulletins in the Usenet newsgroup misc.news-
east-europe.rferl.
     The Voice of America, a government broadcasting service aimed at 
other countries, provides transcripts of its English-language news 
reports through both gopher and anonymous ftp.  For the former, use 
gopher to connect to this address: 

          gopher.voa.gov

and for the latter, to this address:

          ftp.voa.gov

     Daily Brazilian news updates are available (in Portuguese) from the 
University of Sao Paulo.  Use anonymous ftp to connect to
 
          uspif.if.usp.br
 
Use cd to switch to the whois directory.  The news summaries are stored 
in files with this form: NEWS.23OCT92;1.  But to get them, leave off the 
semicolon and the 1, and don't capitalize anything, for example:
 
          get news.23oct92
 
     Daily summaries of news reports from France (in French) are availble 
on the National Capital FreeNet in Ottawa, Ont. Telnet to 

          freenet.carleton.ca

and log on as: guest.  At the main menu, select the number for "The 
Newsstand" and then "La presse de France."
     

10.6  E-MAILING NEWS ORGANIZATIONS


     A number of newspapers, television stations and networks and other 
news organizations now encourage readers and viewers to communicate with 
them electronically, via Internet e-mail addresses.  They include:

     The Middlesex News, Framingham, Mass.  sysop@news.ci.net
     The Boston Globe                       voxbox@globe.com
     WCVB-TV, Boston, Mass.                 wcvb@aol.com
     NBC News, New York, N.Y.               nightly@nbc.com
     The Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa, Ont.       ottawa-citizen@freenet.carleton.ca
     CJOH-TV, Ottawa, Ont.                  ab363@freenet.carleton.ca
     St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times            73174.3344@compuserve.com
     Illinois Issues, Springfield, Ill.     gherardi@sangamon.edu
     WTVF-TV, Nashville, Tenn.              craig.ownsby@nashville.com
     Santa Cruz County (Calif.) Sentinel    sented@cruzio.com
     Morning Journal, Lorain, Ohio          mamjornl@freenet.lorain.oberlin.edu 
     WCCO-TV, Minneapolis, Minn.            wccotv@mr.net
     Tico Times, Costa Rica                 ttimes@huracon.cr

10.7  FYI
 
     The clari.net.newusers newsgroup on Usenet provides a number of 
articles about Clarinet and ways of finding news stories of interest 
to you.
     To discuss the future of newspapers and newsrooms in the new 
electronic medium, subscribe to the Computer Assisted Reporting and 
Research mailing list on Bitnet.  Send a mail message of

to listserv@ulkyvm.bitnet.





Chapter 11: IRC, MUDs AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE FUN THAN THEY SOUND
 
 
 
 
     Many Net systems provide access to a series of interactive 
services that let you hold live "chats" or play online games with 
people around the world.  To find out if your host system offers 
these, you can ask your system administrator or just try them -- if 
nothing happens, then your system does not provide them.  In general, 
if you can use telnet and ftp, chances are good you can use these 
services as well.
 
 
11.1  TALK
 
 
     This is the Net equivalent of a telephone conversation and 
requires that both you and the person you want to talk to have access 
to this function and are online at the same time.  To use it, type 
 
                talk user@site.name
 
where user@site.name is the e-mail address of the other person.  She will 
see something like this on her screen: 
 
                talk: connection requested by yourname@site.name
                talk: respond with:  talk yourname@site.name
                                                                               
To start the conversation, she should then type (at her host system's 
command line):
   
                talk yourname@site.name
 
where that is your e-mail address.  Both of you will then get a top 
and bottom window on your screen.  She will see everything you type in 
one window; you'll see everything she types in the other.  To 
disconnect, hit control-C.
     One note: Public-access sites that use Sun computers sometimes have 
trouble with the talk program.  If talk does not work, try typing
 
     otalk
 
or
 
     ntalk
 
instead.  However, the party at the other end will have to have the same 
program online for the connection to work.
 
 
11.2  INTERNET RELAY CHAT
 
 
     IRC is a program that lets you hold live keyboard conversations 
with people around the world.  It's a lot like an international CB 
radio  - it even uses "channels."  Type something on your computer and 
it's instantly echoed around the world to whoever happens to be on the 
same channel with you.  You can join in existing public group chats or 
set up your own.  You can even create a private channel for yourself 
and as few as one or two other people.  And just like on a CB radio, 
you can give yourself a unique "handle" or nickname.
     IRC currently links host systems in 20 different countries, from 
Australia to Hong Kong to Israel.  Unfortunately, it's like telnet -- 
either your site has it or it doesn't.  If your host system does have it,  
Just type 
     
               irc
 
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
     You are now in channel 0, the "null" channel, in which you can look 
up various help files, but not much else. As you can see, IRC takes over 
your entire screen.  The top of the screen is where messages will 
appear.  The last line is where you type IRC commands and messages.  All 
IRC commands begin with a /.  The slash tells the computer you are about 
to enter a command, rather than a message. To see what channels are 
available, type 
 
                /list
 
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:

*** #p/g!      4                                                               
*** #DragonSrv 1                                                               
 
     Because IRC allows for a large number of channels, the list might 
scroll off your screen, so you might want to turn on your computer's 
screen capture to capture the entire list.  Note that the channels 
always have names, instead of numbers.  Each line in the listing tells 
you the channel name, the number of people currently in it, and whether 
there's a specific topic for it.  To switch to a particular channel, 
type 
 
                /join #channel
 
where "#channel" is the channel name and hit enter.  Some "public" 
channels actually require an invitation from somebody already on it.  To 
request an invitation, type
 
                /who #channel-name
 
where channel-name is the name of the channel, and hit enter.  Then ask 
someone with an @ next to their name if you can join in.  Note that 
whenever you enter a channel, you have to include the #.  Choose one 
with a number of users, so you can see IRC in action. 
     If it's a busy channel, as soon as you join it, the top of your 
screen will quickly be filled with messages.  Each will start with a 
person's IRC nickname, followed by his message.
     It may seem awfully confusing at first.  There could be two or 
three conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the 
messages will come in so fast you'll wonder how you can read them all.  
     Eventually, though, you'll get into the rhythm of the channel and 
things will begin to make more sense.  You might even want to add your 
two cents (in fact, don't be surprised if a message to you shows up on 
your screen right away; on some channels, newcomers are welcomed 
immediately).  To enter a public message, simply type it on that bottom 
line (the computer knows it's a message because you haven't started the 
line with a slash) and hit enter.                             
     Public messages have a user's nickname in brackets, like this:
 
                <tomg>
 
     If you receive a private message from somebody, his name will be 
between asterisks, like this:
 
                *tomg*
 
 
11.3  IRC COMMANDS
 
 
Note: Hit enter after each command.
 
 
/away         When you're called away to put out a grease fire 
              in the kitchen, issue this command to let others know 
              you're still connected but just away from your terminal 
              or computer for awhile. 
 
 
/help         Brings up a list of commands for which there is a help 
              file. You will get a "topic:" prompt.  Type in the 
              subject for which you want information and hit enter.  
              Hit enter by itself to exit help. 
 
/invite       Asks another IRC to join you in a conversation.
 
                        /invite fleepo #hottub
 
              would send a message to fleepo asking him to join you on 
              the #hottub channel.  The channel name is optional.
 
 
 
/join         Use this to switch to or create a particular channel, 
              like this: 
 
                        /join #hottub        
 
              If one of these channels exists and is not a private 
              one, you will enter it.  Otherwise, you have just 
              created it. Note you have to use a # as the first 
              character.
 
 
/list         This will give you a list of all available public 
              channels, their topics (if any) and the number of users 
              currently on them.  Hidden and private channels are not 
              shown. 
 
/m name       Send a private message to that user.
 
/mode         This lets you determine who can join a channel you've 
              created.  
 
                        /mode #channel +s
 
              creates a secret channel.
 
 
                        /mode #channel +p
 
              makes the channel private
 
/nick         This lets you change the name by which others see you.
 
                        /nick fleepo
 
              would change your name for the present session to 
              fleepo. People can still use /whois to find your e-mail
              address.  If you try to enter a channel where somebody 
              else is already using that nickname, IRC will ask you to 
              select another name.
 
/query        This sets up a private conversation between you and 
              another IRC user.  To do this, type
 
                        /query nickname
 
              Every message you type after that will go only to that 
              person.  If she then types
 
                        /query nickname
 
              where nickname is yours, then you have established a 
              private conversation.  To exit this mode, type
 
                        /query
 
              by itself.  While in query mode, you and the other 
              person can continue to "listen" to the discussion on 
              whatever public channels you were on, although neither 
              of you will be able to respond to any of the messages 
              there. 
 
/quit         Exit IRC.
 
/signoff      Exit IRC.
 
/summon       Asks somebody connected to a host system with IRC to 
              join you on IRC. You must use the person's entire e-mail
              address.
 
                        /summon fleepo@foo.bar.com
 
              would send a message to fleepo asking him to start IRC.  
              Usually not a good idea to just summon people unless you 
              know they're already amenable to the idea; otherwise you 
              may wind up annoying them no end. This command does not
              work on all sites.
 
/topic        When you've started a new channel, use this command to let
              others know what it's about.
 
                        /topic #Amiga
 
               would tell people who use /list that your channel is meant
               for discussing Amiga computers.
 
/who <chan>   Shows you the e-mail address of people on a particular 
              channel.
 
                        /who #foo
 
              would show you the addresses of everybody on channel foo.
 
                       /who
 
              by itself shows you every e-mail address for every person 
              on IRC at the time, although be careful: on a busy night
              you might get a list of 500 names!
 
/whois        Use this to get some information about a specific IRC 
              user or to see who is online.  
 
                        /whois nickname
 
              will give you the e-mail address for the person using 
              that nickname.  
 
                        /whois *
 
              will list everybody on every channel.
 
/whowas       Similar to /whois; gives information for people who 
              recently signed off IRC.
 
 
11.4  IRC IN TIMES OF CRISIS


     IRC has become a new medium for staying on top of really big 
breaking news.  In 1993, when Russian lawmakers barricaded themselves 
inside the parliament building, some enterprising Muscovites and a couple 
of Americans set up a "news channel" on IRC to relay first-person 
accounts direct from Moscow. The channel was set up to provide a 
continuous loop of information, much like all-news radio stations that 
cycle through the day's news every 20 minutes.  In 1994, Los Angeles 
residents set up a similar channel to relay information related to the 
Northridge earthquake.  In both cases, logs of the channels were archived 
somewhere on the Net, for those unable to "tune in" live.
     How would you find such channels in the future?  Use the /list 
command to scroll through the available channels.  If one has been set up 
to discuss a particular breaking event, chances are you'll see a brief 
description next to the channel name that will tell you that's the place 
to tune.


11.5  MUDs
 
 
     Multiple-User Dimensions or Dungeons (MUDs) take IRC into the 
realm of fantasy.  MUDs are live, role-playing games in which you 
enter assume a new identity and enter an alternate reality through 
your keyboard.  As you explore this other world, through a series of 
simple commands (such as "look," "go" and "take"), you'll run across 
other users, who may engage you in a friendly discussion, enlist your 
aid in some quest or try to kill you for no apparent reason. 
     Each MUD has its own personality and creator (or God) who was 
willing to put in the long hours required to establish the particular 
MUD's rules, laws of nature and information databases.  Some MUDs 
stress the social aspects of online communications -- users frequently 
gather online to chat and join together to build new structures or 
even entire realms.  Others are closer to "Dungeons and Dragons" and 
are filled with sorcerers, dragons and evil people out to keep you 
from completing your quest -- through murder if necessary. 
     Many MUDs (there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs) 
require you to apply in advance, through e-mail, for a character name 
and password.  One that lets you look around first, though, is 
HoloMuck at McGill University in Montreal.  The premise of this game 
is that you arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl, a city on the planet 
Holo.  You have to find a place to live (else you get thrown into the 
homeless shelter) and then you can begin exploring.  Magic is allowed 
on this world, but only outside the city limits.  Get bored with the 
city and you can roam the rest of the world or even take a trip into 
orbit (of course, all this takes money; you can either wait for your 
weekly salary or take a trip to the city casino).  Once you become 
familiar with the city and get your own character, you can even begin 
erecting your own building (or subway line, or almost anything else). 
     To connect, telnet to 
 
                collatz.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5757
 
     When you connect, type
 
                connect guest guest
 
     and hit enter.  This connects you to the "guest" account, which 
has a password of "guest."        
You'll see this:
 
The Homeless Shelter(#22Rna)                                                   
You wake up in the town's Homeless Shelter, where vagrants are put for         
protective holding.  Please don't sleep in public places-- there are plenty of 
open apartments available.  Type 'apartments' to see how to get to an          
apartment building with open vacancies.                                        
There is a small sign on the wall here, with helpful information.  Type 'look  
sign' to read it.                                                              
The door is standing open for your return to respectable society.  Simply walk 
'out' to the center.                                                           
     Of course, you want to join respectable society, but first you 
want to see what that sign says.  So you type 
 
                look sign
 
and hit enter, which brings up a list of some basic commands.  Then 
you type 
 
                out
 
followed by enter, which brings up this:
 
You slip out the door, and head southeast...                                   
Tanstaafl Center                                                               
This is the center of the beautiful town of Tanstaafl.  High Street runs north 
and south into residential areas, while Main Street runs east and west into    
business districts.                                                            
SW: is Tanstaafl Towers.  Please claim an apartment... no sleeping in public!  
SE: the Public Library offers both information and entertainment.              
NW: is the Homeless Shelter, formerly the Town Jail.                           
NE: is Town Hall, site of several important services, including: Public        
Message Board, Bureau of Land Management (with maps and regulations), and      
other governmental/ bureaucratic help.                                         
Down: Below a sign marked with both red and blue large letter 'U's, a          
staircase leads into an underground subway passage.                            
(Feel free to 'look' in any direction for more information.)                   
[Obvious exits: launch, d, nw, se, w, e, n, s, ne, sw]                         
Contents:                                                                      
Instructions for newcomers                                                     
Directional signpost                                                           
Founders' statue                                                               
 
     To see "Instructions for newcomers", type
 
                look Instructions for newcomers
 
and hit enter.  You could do the same for "Directional signpost" and 
"Founders' statue."  Then type
 
                SW
 
and enter to get to Tanstaafl Towers, the city housing complex, where 
you have to claim an apartment (you may have to look around; many will 
already) be occupied.  And now it's off to explore Holo!  One command 
you'll want to keep in mind is "take." Periodically, you'll come 
across items that, when you take them will confer certain abilities or 
powers on you.  If you type
 
                help
 
and enter, you'll get a list of files you can read to learn more about 
the MUD's commands.
     The "say" command lets you talk to other players publicly. For 
example, 
 
                say Hey, I'm here!
 
would be broadcast to everybody else in the room with you.  If you 
want to talk to just one particular person, use "whisper" instead of 
"say."

        whisper agora=Hey, I'm here!                                           
 
would be heard only by agora.  Another way to communicate with 
somebody regardless of where on the world they are is through your 
pager.  If you suddenly see yours go off while visiting, chances are 
it's a wizard checking to see if you need any help.  To read his 
message, type
 
                page
 
To send him a message, type
 
                page name=message
 
where name is the wizard's name (it'll be in the original message).
      Other MUDs and MUCKs may have different commands, but generally 
use the same basic idea of letting you navigate through relatively 
simple English commands.   
     When you connect to a MUD, choose your password as carefully as 
you would one for your host system; alas, there are MUD crackers who 
enjoy trying to break into other people's MUD accounts.  And never, 
never use the same password as the one you use on your host system!
     MUDs can prove highly addicting.  "The jury is still out on 
whether MUDding is 'just a game'  or 'an extension of real life with 
gamelike qualities'," says Jennifer Smith, an active MUD player who 
wrote an FAQ on the subject. 
     She adds one caution: "You shouldn't do anything that you 
wouldn't do in real life, even if the world is a fantasy world.  The 
important thing to remember is that it's the fantasy world of possibly 
hundreds of people, and not just yours in  particular.  There's a 
human being on the other side of each and every wire!  Always remember 
that you may meet these other people some day,  and they may break 
your nose.  People who treat others badly gradually build up bad 
reputations and eventually receive the NO FUN Stamp of Disapproval." 
 
 

11.6  GO, GO, GO (AND CHESS, TOO)!

     Fancy a good game of go or chess?  You no longer have to head for 
the nearest park with a board in hand.  The Internet has a couple of 
machines that let you engage people from around the world in your 
favorite board games.  Or, if you prefer, you can watch matches in 
progress.
     To play go, 

        telnet hellspark.wharton.upenn.edu 6969
        log on as: guest

You'll find prompts to various online help files to get you started. 
     For a chess match, 
                        
        telnet news.panix.com 5000
        log on as: guest

You'll find prompts for online help files on the system, which lets you 
choose your skill level.


11.7  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN
 

     All is not fun and games on the Net.  Like any community, the Net 
has its share of obnoxious characters who seem to exist only to make 
your life miserable (you've already met some of them in chapter 4).  
There are people who seem to spend a bit more time on the Net than many 
would find healthy.  It also has its criminals.  Clifford Stoll writes in 
"The Cuckoo's Egg" how he tracked a team of German hackers who were 
breaking into U.S. computers and selling the information they found to 
the Soviets.  Robert Morris, a Cornell University student, was convicted 
of unleashing a "worm" program that effectively disabled several thousand 
computers connected to the Internet.  
     Of more immediate concern to the average Net user are crackers 
who seek to find other's passwords to break into Net systems and people 
who infect programs on ftp sites with viruses.
    There is a widely available program known as "Crack" that can 
decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a 
dictionary (this is why you shouldn't use such passwords).  Short of 
that, there are the annoying types who take a special thrill in trying to 
make you miserable.  The best advice in dealing with them is to count to 
10 and then ignore them -- like juveniles everywhere, most of their fun 
comes in seeing how upset you can get. 
    Meanwhile, two Cornell University students pleaded guilty in 1992 to 
uploading virus-infected Macintosh programs to ftp sites.  If you plan 
to try out large amounts of software from ftp sites, it might be wise to 
download or buy a good anti-viral program.
    But can law enforcement go too far in seeking out the criminals?  
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in large part in 
response to a series of government raids against an alleged gang of 
hackers.  The raids resulted in the near bankruptcy of one game
company never alleged to have had anything to do with the hackers, 
when the government seized its computers and refused to give them 
back.  The case against another alleged participant collapsed in court 
when his attorney showed the "proprietary" and supposedly hacked 
information he printed in an electronic newsletter was actually 
available via an 800 number for about $13 -- from the phone company 
from which that data was taken.


11.8  FYI
 
     You can find discussions about IRC in the alt.irc newsgroup. 
     "A Discussion on Computer Network Conferencing," by Darren Reed 
(May, 1992), provides a theoretical background on why conferencing 
systems such as IRC are a Good Thing.  It's available through ftp at 
nic.ddn.mil in the rfc directory as rfc1324.txt.
     Every Friday, Scott Goehring posts a new list of  MUDs and related 
games and their telnet addresses in the newsgroup rec.games.mud.announce. 
There are several other mud newsgroups related to specific types of MUDs, 
including rec.games.mud.social, rec.games.mud.adventure, 
rec.games.mud.tiny, rec.games.mud.diku and rec.games.mud.lp. 
     For a good overview of the impact on the Internet of the Morris 
Worm, read "Virus Highlights Need for Improved Internet Management," by 
the U.S. General Accounting Office (June, 1989).  You can get a copy via 
ftp from cert.sei.cmu.edu in the pub/virus-l/docs directory.  It's 
listed as gao_rpt. 
     Clifford Stoll describes how the Internet works and how he tracked 
a group of KGB-paid German hackers through it, in "The Cuckoo's Egg: 
Tracking a Spy through the Maze of Computer Espionage," Doubleday 
(1989).





Chapter 12: EDUCATION AND THE NET 
 
 
 

12.1  THE NET IN THE CLASSROOM


     If you're a teacher, you've probably already begun to see the 
potential the Net has for use in the class.  Usenet, ftp and telnet have 
tremendous educational potential, from keeping up with world events to 
arranging international science experiments. 
     Because the Net now reaches so many countries and often stays 
online even when the phones go down, you and your students can  "tune 
in" to first-hand accounts during international conflicts.  Look at 
your system's list of Usenet soc.culture groups to see if there is one 
about the country or region you're interested in.  Even in peacetime, 
these newsgroups can be great places to find people from countries you 
might be studying. 
     The biggest problem may be getting accounts for your students, if 
you're not lucky enough to live within the local calling area of a 
Free-Net system. Many colleges and universities, however, are willing 
to discuss providing accounts for secondary students at little or no 
cost.  Several states, including California and Texas, have Internet-
linked networks for teachers and students. 

12.2  SOME SPECIFIC RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS

     In addition, there are a number of resources on the Internet aimed 
specifically at elementary and secondary students and teachers.  You 
can use these to set up science experiments with classes in another 
country, learn how to use computers in the classroom or keep up with the 
latest advances in teaching everything from physics to physical 
education.
     Among them:

                AskERIC provides a way for educators, librarians and 
                others interested in K-12 education to get more 
                information about virtually everything.  The center 
                maintains an e-mail address (askeric@ericir.syr.edu) for 
                questions and promises answers within 48 hours.  It also 
                maintains a gopher site that contains digests of 
                questions and answers, lesson plans in a variety of 
                fields and other educationally related information.  The 
                gopher address is ericir.syr.edu. 

Health-Ed:      A mailing list for health educators.  Send a request to 
                health-ed-request@stjhmc.fidonet.org 
 
K12Net:         Begun on the Fidonet hobbyist network, K12Net is now also 
                carried on many Usenet systems and provides a host of 
                interesting and valuable services.  These include 
                international chat for students, foreign-language 
                discussions (for example, there are French and German-
                only conference where American students can practice 
                those languages with students from Quebec and German).  
                There are also conferences aimed at teachers of specific 
                subjects, from physical education to physics. The K12 
                network still has limited distribution, so ask your 
                system administrator if your system carries it. 
 
Kidsphere:      Kidsphere is a mailing list for elementary and secondary 
                teachers, who use it to arrange joint projects and 
                discuss educational telecommunications.  You will find 
                news of new software, lists of sites from which you can 
                get computer-graphics pictures from various NASA 
                satellites and probes and other news of interest to 
                modem-using teachers.  
                     To subscribe, send a request by e-mail to kidsphere-
                request@vms.cis.pitt.edu or joinkids@vms.cis.pitt.edu and 
                you will start receiving messages within a couple of 
                days. 
                     To contribute to the discussion, send messages to 
                kidsphere@vms.cis.pitt.edu.

NASA Spacelink: This system, run by NASA in Huntsville, Ala., 
                provides all sorts of reports and data about NASA, its 
                history and its various missions, past and present.  
                Telnet spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov or 128.158.13.250. 
                     When you connect, you'll be given an overview of the 
                system and asked to register. The system maintains a 
                large file library of GIF-format space graphics, but note 
                that you can't download these through telnet. If you want 
                to, you have to dial the system directly, at (205) 895-
                0028.  Many can be obtained through ftp from 
                ames.arc.nasa.gov, however. 

Newton:          Run by the Argonne National Laboratory, it offers 
                conferences for teachers and students, including one 
                called "Ask a Scientist."  
 
                     Telnet: newton.dep.anl.gov.  
                     Log in as: cocotext 
 
                You'll be asked to provide your name and address.  When 
                you get the main menu, hit 4 for the various conferences.  
                The "Ask a Scientist" category lets you ask questions of 
                scientists in fields from biology to earth science.  
                Other categories let you discuss teaching, sports and 
                computer networks. 
 
OERI:           The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational 
                Resources and Improvement runs a gopher system that 
                provides numerous educational resources, information and 
                statistics for teachers.  Use gopher to connect to

                     gopher.ed.gov. 

Spacemet Forum: If your system doesn't carry the K12 conferences, but 
                does provide you with telnet, you can reach the 
                conferences through SpaceMet Forum, a bulletin-board 
                system aimed at teachers and students that is run by the 
                physics and astronomy department at the University of 
                Massachusetts at Amherst.  
                
                     Telnet: spacemet.phast.umass.edu. 
                
                When you connect, hit escape once, after which you'll be 
                asked to log on. Like K12Net, SpaceMet Forum began as a 
                Fidonet system, but has since grown much larger.  Mort 
                and Helen Sternheim, professors at the university, 
                started SpaceMet as a one-line bulletin-board system 
                several years ago to help bolster middle-school science 
                education in nearby towns. 
                     In addition to the K12 conferences, SpaceMet carries 
                numerous educationally oriented conferences.  It also has 
                a large file library of interest to educators and 
                students, but be aware that getting files to your site 
                could be difficult and maybe even impossible.  Unlike 
                most other Internet sites, Spacemet does not use an ftp 
                interface. The Sternheims say ZMODEM sometimes works over 
                the network, but don't count on it. 

 
12.3  USENET AND BITNET IN THE CLASSROOM

     There are numerous Usenet newsgroups of potential interest to 
teachers and students.  
     As you might expect, many are of a scientific bent. You can find 
these by typing l sci. in rn or using nngrep sci. for nn. There are now 
close to 40, with subjects ranging from archaeology to economics (the 
"dismal science," remember?) to astronomy to nanotechnology (the 
construction of microscopically small machines).
     One thing students will quickly learn from many of these groups: 
science is not just dull, boring facts.  Science is argument and standing 
your ground and making your case.  The Usenet sci. groups encourage 
critical thinking. 
     Beyond science, social-studies and history classes can keep busy 
learning about other countries, through the soc.culture newsgroups.
     Most of these newsgroups originated as ways for expatriates of a 
given country to keep in touch with their homeland and its culture.  In 
times of crisis, however, these groups often become places to 
disseminate information from or into the country and to discuss what is 
happening.  From Afghanistan to Yugoslavia, close to 50 countries are 
now represented on Usenet.  To see which groups are available, use l 
soc.culture. in rn or nngrep soc.culture. for nn. 
     Several "talk" newsgroups provide additional topical discussions, 
but teachers should screen them first before recommending them to 
students.  They range from talk.abortion and talk.politics.guns to 
talk.politics.space and talk.environment.
     One caveat:  Teachers might want to peruse particular newsgroups 
before setting their students loose in them.  Some have higher levels of 
flaming and blather than others.
     There are also a number of Bitnet discussion groups of potential 
interest to students and teachers.  See Chapter 5 for information on 
finding and subscribing to Bitnet discussion groups.  Some with an 
educational orientation include:
 
biopi-l     ksuvm.bitnet        Secondary biology education
chemed-l    uwf.bitnet          Chemistry education
dts-l       iubvm.bitnet        The Dead Teacher's Society list
phys-l      uwf.bitnet          Discussions for physics teachers
physhare    psuvm.bitnet        Where physics teachers share resources
scimath-l   psuvm.bitnet        Science and math education

     To get a list of ftp sites that carry astronomical images in the GIF 
graphics format, use ftp to connect to nic.funet.fi. Switch to the 
/pub/astro/general directory and get the file astroftp.txt.  Among the 
sites listed is ames.arc.nasa.gov, which carries images taken by the 
Voyager and Galileo probes, among other pictures. 





CHAPTER 13:  Business on the Net



13.1  SETTING UP SHOP


     Back in olden days, oh, before 1990 or so, there were no markets in 
the virtual community -- if you wanted to buy a book, you still had to 
jump in your car and drive to the nearest bookstore.
     This was because in those days, the Net consisted mainly of a series 
of government-funded networks on which explicit commercial activity was 
forbidden.  Today, much of the Net is run by private companies, which 
generally have no such restrictions, and a number of companies have begun 
experimenting with online "shops" or other services.  Many of these shops 
are run by booksellers, while the services range from delivery of indexed 
copies of federal documents to an online newsstand that hopes to entice 
you to subscribe to any of several publications (of the printed on paper 
variety).  A number of companies also use Usenet newsgroups (in the biz 
hierarchy) to distribute press releases and product information.
     Still, commercial activity on the remains far below that found on 
other networks, such as CompuServe, with its Electronic Mall, or Prodigy, 
with its advertisements on almost every screen.  In part that's because 
of the newness and complexity of the Internet as a commercial medium.  In 
part, however, that is because of security concerns.  Companies worry 
about such issues as crackers getting into their system over the network, 
and many people do not like the idea of sending a credit-card number via 
the Internet (an e-mail message could be routed through several sites to 
get to its destination).  These concerns could disappear as Net users 
turn to such means as message encryption and "digital signatures." In the 
meantime, however, businesses on the Net can still consider themselves 
something of Internet pioneers. 
     A couple of public-access sites and a regional network have set up 
"marketplaces" for online businesses. 
     The World in Brookline, Mass., currently rents "space" to several 
bookstores and computer-programming firms, as well as an "adult toy 
shop."  To browse their offerings, use gopher to connect to

        world.std.com

At the main menu, select "Shops on the World."
     Msen in Ann Arbor provides its "Msen Marketplace," where you'll find 
a travel agency and an "Online Career Center" offering help-wanted ads 
from across the country.  Msen also provides an "Internet Business 
Pages," an online directory of companies seeking to reach the Internet 
community.  You can reach Msen through gopher at 

        gopher.msen.com

At the main menu, select "Msen Marketplace."
     The Nova Scotia Technology Network runs a "Cybermarket" on its 
gopher service at

        nstn.ns.ca

There, you'll find an online bookstore that lets you order books through 
e-mail (to which you'll have to trust your credit-card number) and a 
similar "virtual record store.'' Both let you search their wares by 
keyword or by browsing through catalogs.

     Other online businesses include:

AnyWare Associates      This Boston company runs an Internet-to-fax
                        gateway that lets you send fax message anywhere
                        in the world via the Internet (for a fee, of 
                        course).  For more information, write

                        Internet product is indexed versions of federal
                        journals, including the Federal Register (a daily
                        compendium of government contracts, proposed 
                        regulations and the like).  Internet users can
                        browse through recent copies, but complete access
                        will run several thousand dollars a year.  Use
                        gopher to connect to

                                enews.com

                        and select "Counterpoint Publishing"

Chapter 14: CONCLUSION -- THE END?
 
 
     The revolution is just beginning.  New communications systems and 
digital technologies have already meant dramatic changes in the way we 
live.  Think of what is already routine that would have been considered 
impossible just ten years ago.  You can browse through the holdings of 
your local library -- or of libraries halfway around the world -- do your 
banking and see if your neighbor has gone bankrupt, all through a 
computer and modem.  
     Imploding costs coupled with exploding power are bringing ever 
more powerful computer and digital systems to ever growing numbers of 
people.  The Net, with its rapidly expanding collection of databases 
and other information sources, is no longer limited to the 
industrialized nations of the West; today the web extends from Siberia 
to Zimbabwe.  The cost of computers and modems used to plug into the Net, 
meanwhile, continue to plummet, making them ever more affordable. 
     Cyberspace has become a vital part of millions of people's daily 
lives. People form relationships online, they fall in love, they get 
married, all because of initial contacts in cyberspace, that ephemeral 
``place'' that transcends national and state boundaries. Business 
deals are transacted entirely in ASCII.  Political and social 
movements begin online, coordinated by people who could be thousands 
of miles apart. 
     Yet this is only the beginning.  
     We live in an age of communication, yet the various media we use 
to talk to one another remain largely separate systems. One day, 
however, your telephone, TV, fax machine and personal computer will be 
replaced by a single ``information processor'' linked to the worldwide 
Net by strands of optical fiber.  
     Beyond databases and file libraries, power will be at your 
fingertips. Linked to thousands, even millions of like-minded people, 
you'll be able to participate in social and political movements across 
the country and around the world.   
     How does this happen? In part, it will come about through new 
technologies. High-definition television will require the development 
of inexpensive computers that can process as much information as 
today's workstations.  Telephone and cable companies will cooperate, or 
in some cases compete, to bring those fiber-optic cables into your home.
     The Clinton administration, arguably the first led by people who 
know how to use not only computer networks but computers, is pushing for 
creation of a series of "information superhighways" comparable in scope 
to the Interstate highway system of the 1950s (one of whose champions in 
the Senate has a son elected vice president in 1992).    
     Right now, we are in the network equivalent of the early 1950s, 
just before the creation of that massive highway network. Sure, there are 
plenty of interesting things out there, but you have to meander along 
two-lane roads, and have a good map, to get to them. 
     Creation of this new Net will require more than just high-speed 
channels and routing equipment; it will require a new communications 
paradigm: the Net as information utility.  The Net remains a somewhat 
complicated and mysterious place.  To get something out of the Net today, 
you have to spend a fair amount of time with a Net veteran or a manual 
like this.  You have to learn such arcana as the vagaries of the Unix cd 
command.  
     Contrast this with the telephone, which now also provides access to 
large amounts of information through push buttons, or a computer network 
such as Prodigy, which one navigates through simple commands and mouse 
clicks.
     Internet system administrators have begun to realize that not all 
people want to learn the intricacies of Unix, and that that fact does 
not make them bad people.  We are already seeing the development of 
simple interfaces that will put the Net's power to use by millions of 
people.  You can already see their influence in the menus of gophers and 
the World-Wide Web, which require no complex computing skills but which 
open the gates to thousands of information resources.  Mail programs and 
text editors such as pico and pine promise much of the power of older 
programs such as emacs at a fraction of the complexity. 
     Some software engineers are taking this even further, by creating 
graphical interfaces that will let somebody navigate the Internet just by 
clicking on the screen with a mouse or by calling up an easy text editor, 
sort of the way one can now navigate a Macintosh computer -- or a 
commercial online service such as Prodigy. 
     Then there are the Internet services themselves.  
     For every database now available through the Internet, there are 
probably three or four that are not.  Government agencies are only 
now beginning to connect their storehouses of information to the 
Net. Several commercial vendors, from database services to booksellers, 
have made their services available through the Net.
     Few people now use one of the Net's more interesting 
applications.  A standard known as MIME lets one send audio and 
graphics files in a message.  Imagine opening your e-mail one day to hear 
your granddaughter's first words, or a "photo" of your friend's new 
house.  Eventually, this standard could allow for distribution of even 
small video displays over the Net.
    All of this will require vast new amounts of Net power, to handle 
both the millions of new people who will jump onto the Net and the new 
applications they want.  Replicating a moving image on a computer screen 
alone takes a phenomenal amount of computer bits, and computing power to 
arrange them. 
     All of this combines into a National Information Infrastructure able 
to move billions of bits of information in one second -- the kind of 
power needed to hook information "hoses" into every business and house.
     As these "superhighways" grow, so will the "on ramps," for a high-
speed road does you little good if you can't get to it.   The costs of 
modems seem to fall as fast as those of computers.  High-speed modems 
(9600 baud and up) are becoming increasingly affordable.  At 9600 baud, 
you can download a satellite weather image of North America in less than 
two minutes, a file that, with a slower modem could take up to 20 
minutes to download.  Eventually, homes could be connected directly to a 
national digital network.  Most long-distance phone traffic is already 
carried in digital form, through high-volume optical fibers.  Phone 
companies are ever so slowly working to extend these fibers the "final 
mile" to the home.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation is working to 
ensure these links are affordable. 
     Beyond the technical questions are increasingly thorny social, 
political and economic issues. Who is to have access to these 
services, and at what cost?  If we live in an information age, are we 
laying the seeds for a new information under class, unable to compete 
with those fortunate enough to have the money and skills needed to 
manipulate new communications channels? Who, in fact, decides who has 
access to what?  As more companies realize the potential profits to be 
made in the new information infrastructure, what happens to such 
systems as Usenet, possibly the world's first successful anarchistic 
system, where everybody can say whatever they want? 
     What are the laws of the electronic frontier?  When national and 
state boundaries lose their meaning in cyberspace,  the question might 
even be: WHO is the law?  What if a practice that is legal in one 
country is "committed" in another country where it is illegal, over a 
computer network that crosses through a third country? Who goes after 
computer crackers? 
     What role will you play in the revolution? 






Appendix A: THE LINGO

     Like any community, the Net has developed its own language.  
What follows is a glossary of some of the more common phrases you'll 
likely run into.  But it's only a small subset of net.speak.  You an find 
a more complete listing in "The New Hacker's Dictionary," compiled by 
Eric Raymond (MIT Press).  Raymond's work is based on an online reference 
known as "The Jargon File," which you can get through anonymous ftp from 
ftp.gnu.mit.ai.mit as jarg300.txt.gz in the pub/gnu directory (see 
chapter 7 for information on how to un-compress a .gz file). 
 
ASCII           Has two meanings.  ASCII is a universal computer code 
                for English letters and characters.  Computers store 
                all information as binary numbers. In ASCII, the 
                letter "A" is stored as 01000001, whether the computer 
                is made by IBM, Apple or Commodore.  ASCII also refers 
                to a method, or protocol, for copying files from one 
                computer to another over a network, in which neither 
                computer checks for any errors that might have been 
                caused by static or other problems.
 
ANSI            Computers use several different methods for deciding 
                how to put information on your screen and how your 
                keyboard interacts with the screen.  ANSI is one of 
                these "terminal emulation" methods.  Although most 
                popular on PC-based bulletin-board systems, it can also 
                be found on some Net sites.  To use it properly, you 
                will first have to turn it on, or enable it, in your 
                communications software.
 
 
ARPANet         A predecessor of the Internet.  Started in 1969 with 
                funds from the Defense Department's Advanced Projects 
                Research Agency. 
 
backbone        A high-speed network that connects several powerful 
                computers.  In the U.S., the backbone of the Internet is 
                often considered the NSFNet, a government funded link 
                between a handful of supercomputer sites across the 
                country. 
 
Baud            The speed at which modems transfer data.  One baud is 
                roughly equal to one bit per second.  It takes eight 
                bits to make up one letter or character.  Modems rarely 
                transfer data at exactly the same speed as their listed 
                baud rate because of static or computer problems. More 
                expensive modems use systems, such as Microcom Network 
                Protocol (MNP), which can correct for these errors or 
                which "compress" data to speed up transmission.
 
BITNet          Another, academically oriented, international computer 
                network, which uses a different set of computer 
                instructions to move data.  It is easily accessible to 
                Internet users through e-mail, and provides a large 
                number of conferences and databases.  Its name comes from 
                "Because It's Time." " 
 
Bounce          What your e-mail does when it cannot get to its 
                recipient -- it bounces back to you -- unless it goes 
                off into the ether, never to be found again.
 
Command line    On Unix host systems, this is where you tell the 
                machine what you want it to do, by entering commands.
 
Communications  A program that tells a modem how to work.
software   
 
Daemon          An otherwise harmless Unix program that normally works 
                out of sight of the user. On the Internet, you'll most 
                likely encounter it only when your e-mail is not 
                delivered to your recipient -- you'll get back your 
                original message plus an ugly message from a "mailer 
                daemon. 
 
Distribution    A way to limit where your Usenet postings go.  Handy for 
                such things as "for sale" messages or discussions of 
                regional politics. 
 
Domain          The last part of an Internet address, such as "news.com."
 
Dot             When you want to impress the net veterans you meet at 
                parties, say "dot" instead of "period," for example: "My 
                address is john at site dot domain dot com." 
 
Dot file        A file on a Unix public-access system 
                that alters the way you or your messages interact with 
                that system.  For example, your .login file contains 
                various parameters for such things as the text editor you 
                get when you send a message.   When you do an ls command, 
                these files do not appear in the directory listing; do ls 
                -a to list them. 
 
Down            When a public-access site runs into technical trouble, 
                and you can no longer gain access to it, it's down.
 
Download        Copy a file from a host system to your computer.  There 
                are several different methods, or protocols, for 
                downloading files, most of which periodically check the 
                file as it is being copied to ensure no information is 
                inadvertently destroyed or damaged during the process. 
                Some, such as XMODEM, only let you download one file at 
                a time.  Others, such as batch-YMODEM and ZMODEM, let 
                you type in the names of several files at once, which 
                are then automatically downloaded. 
 
EMACS           A standard Unix text editor preferred by Unix types
                that beginners tend to hate.                
 
E-mail          Electronic mail -- a way to send a private message to 
                somebody else on the Net. Used as both noun and verb.
 
Emoticon        See smiley.
 
F2F             Face to Face.  When you actually meet those people you 
                been corresponding with/flaming.
 
FAQ             Frequently Asked Questions.  A compilation of answers to 
                these.  Many Usenet newsgroups have these files, which 
                are posted once a month or so for beginners. 
 
Film at 11      One reaction to an overwrought argument: "Imminent death 
                of the Net predicted. Film at 11."
 
Finger          An Internet program that lets you get some bit of 
                information about another user, provided they have first 
                created a .plan file. 
 
Flame           Online yelling and/or ranting directed at somebody else.  
                Often results in flame wars, which occasionally turn into 
                holy wars (see). 
 
Followup        A Usenet posting that is a response to an earlier 
                message.

                you want to know when another site is run by a for-
                profit company, look for an address in the form of 
                foo@foobar.com."

GNU             Gnu's Not Unix.  A project of the Free Software 
                Foundation to write a free version of the Unix operating 
                system. 

Hacker          On the Net, unlike among the general public, this is not
                a bad person; it is simply somebody who enjoys stretching
                hardware and software to their limits, seeing just what 
                they can get their computers to do.  What many people 
                call hackers, net.denizens refer to as crackers.

Handshake       Two modems trying to connect first do this to agree on 
                how to transfer data.
 
Hang            When a modem fails to hang up.
 
Holy war        Arguments that involve certain basic tenets of faith, 
                about which one cannot disagree without setting one of 
                these off.  For example: IBM PCs are inherently superior to 
                Macintoshes.                     
         
Host system     A public-access site; provides Net access to people 
                outside the research and government community.
 
IMHO            In My Humble Opinion.
 
Internet        A worldwide system for linking smaller computer 
                networks together.  Networks connected through the 
                Internet use a particular set of communications 
                standards to communicate, known as TCP/IP.
 
Killfile        A file that lets you filter Usenet postings to some 
                extent, by excluding messages on certain topics or from 
                certain people.

Lurk            Read messages in a Usenet newsgroup without ever saying 
                anything.
 
Mailing list    Essentially a conference in which messages are delivered 
                right to your mailbox, instead of to a Usenet newsgroup.  
                You get on these by sending a message to a specific e-
                mail address, which is often that of a computer that 
                automates the process. 
 
MOTSS           Members of the Same Sex.  Gays and Lesbians online.  
                Originally an acronym used in the 1980 federal census.

                all and who has done it all.
 
Net.personality Somebody sufficiently opinionated/flaky/with plenty of 
                time on his hands to regularly post in dozens of 
                different Usenet newsgroups, whose presence is known to 
                thousands of people.
 
Net.police      Derogatory term for those who would impose their 
                standards on other users of the Net.  Often used in 
                vigorous flame wars (in which it occasionally mutates to 
                net.nazis). 
 
Netiquette      A set of common-sense guidelines for not annoying others.
 
Network         A communications system that links two or more 
                computers. It can be as simple as a cable strung 
                between two computers a few feet apart or as complex 
                as hundreds of thousands of computers around the world 
                linked through fiber optic cables, phone lines and 
                satellites.
 
Newbie          Somebody new to the Net.  Sometimes used derogatorily by 
                net.veterans who have forgotten that, they, too, were 
                once newbies who did not innately know the answer to 
                everything. "Clueless newbie" is always derogatory.
 
Newsgroup       A Usenet conference.
 
NIC             Network Information Center.  As close as an Internet-
                style network gets to a hub; it's usually where you'll 
                find information about that particular network. 
 
NSA line eater  The more aware/paranoid Net users believe that the 
                National Security Agency has a super-powerful computer 
                assigned to reading everything posted on the Net.   They 
                will jokingly (?) refer to this line eater in their 
                postings. Goes back to the early days of the Net when
                the bottom lines of messages would sometimes disappear
                for no apparent reason.
 
NSF             National Science Foundation.  Funds the NSFNet, a 
                high-speed network that once formed the backbone of the

.plan file      A file that lists anything you want others on the Net to 
                know about you.  You place it in your home directory on 
                your public-access site.  Then, anybody who fingers (see) 
                you, will get to see this file. 
 
Post            To compose a message for a Usenet newsgroup and then send 
                it out for others to see.
 
Postmaster      The person to contact at a particular site to ask for 
                information about the site or complain about one of 
                his/her user's behavior. 
 
Protocol        The method used to transfer a file between a host 
                system and your computer. There are several types,

ROT13           A simple way to encode bad jokes, movie reviews that give 
                away the ending, pornography, etc.  Essentially, each 
                letter in a message is replace by the letter 13 spaces 
                away from it in the alphabet.  There are online decoders 
                to read these; nn and rn have them built in. 
 
RTFM            Read the, uh, you know, Manual.  Often used in flames 
                against people who ask computer-related questions that 
                could be easily answered with a few minutes with a 
                manual. More politely: RTM.
 
Screen capture  A part of your communications software that 
                opens a file on your computer and saves to it whatever 
                scrolls past on the screen while connected to a host 
                system. 
 
Server          A computer that can distribute information or files 
                automatically in response to specifically worded e-mail 
                requests. 
 
Shareware       Software that is freely available on the Net.  If you 
                like and use the software, you should send in the fee
                requested by the author, whose name and address will be 
                found in a file distributed with the software. 
 
.sig file       Sometimes, .signature file.  A file that, when placed in 
                your home directory on your public-access site, will 
                automatically be appended to every Usenet posting you 
                write. 
 
.sig quote      A profound/witty/quizzical/whatever quote that you 
                include in your .sig file.
 
Signal-to-noise The amount of useful information to be found in a given
ratio           Usenet newsgroup.  Often used derogatorily, for example: 
                "the signal-to-noise ratio in this newsgroup is pretty low."
 
SIMTEL20        The White Sands Missile Range used to maintain a giant 
                collection of free and low-cost software of all kinds, 
                which was "mirrored" to numerous other ftp sites on the
                Net.  In the fall of 1993, the Air Force decided it had
                better things to do than maintain a free software library
                and shut it down.  But you'll still see references to
                the collection, known as SIMTEL20, around the Net.

Smiley          A way to describe emotion online.  Look at this with
                your head tilted to the left :-).  There are scores
                of these smileys, from grumpy to quizzical.

Snail mail      Mail that comes through a slot in your front door or a
                box mounted outside your house.

                system.

TANSTAAFL       There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch.  
 
TCP/IP          Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The 
                particular system for transferring information over a 
                computer network that is at the heart of the Internet.
 
Telnet          A program that lets you connect to other computers on 
                the Internet.
 
Terminal        There are several methods for determining how your 
emulation       keystrokes and screen interact with a public-access 
                site's operating system.  Most communications programs 
                offer a  choice of "emulations" that let you mimic the 
                keyboard that would normally be attached directly to 
                the host-system computer. 
 
UUCP            Unix-to-Unix CoPy.  A method for transferring Usenet 
                postings and e-mail that requires far fewer net resources 
                than TCP/IP, but which can result in considerably slower 
                transfer times.
 
Upload          Copy a file from your computer to a host system.
 
User name       On most host systems, the first time you connect you

Appendix B: General Information About the Electronic Frontier Foundation





The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a membership organization that
was founded in July of 1990 to ensure that the principles embodied in the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights are protected as new communications
technologies emerge.
 
From the beginning, EFF has worked to shape our nation's communications
infrastructure and the policies that govern it in order to maintain and
enhance First Amendment, privacy and other democratic values.  We believe
that our overriding public goal must be the creation of Electronic
Democracy, so our work focuses on the establishment of:
 
o       new laws that protect citizens' basic Constitutional rights as they
use new communications technologies,
 
o       a policy of common carriage requirements for all network providers
so that all speech, no matter how controversial, will be carried without
discrimination, 
 
o       a National Public Network where voice, data and video services are
accessible to all citizens on an equitable and affordable basis, and
 
o       a diversity of communities that enable all citizens to have a voice
in the information age.
