Using web proxies to disguise your IP address.

-------------------------- A lot of people have been concerned
recently about their anonymity on the internet. Deleting cookies etc.
and paying money for services like the anonymizer. Well here's an easy
(and free) way to get around this problem. Use the proxy machines of
other servers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------- Finding them is pretty easy, the best way
is probably the ping program. From a MS-DOS window in Win95 (or from
your shell) type: ping proxy.name-of-some-isp.net If you a message
like 'bad IP' then there's no such machine but if you get ICMP echo
information, then obviously there is. Also you can try looking around
the isp/companies web site for information, or perhaps a forged
(probably too busy, unconcerned to check.) email to the system admin
asking if they have a proxy machine. If you need the addresses of some
ISPs check out yahoo.com
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------- To use a proxy through your web browser, in
Netscape, click on Options|Network Preferences then click on the
'Proxies' tab and check the radio button 'Manual Proxy config' and
then click the 'view' button. Set it up for whatever protocols you
want, (some proxies might only support HTTP) probably FTP and HTTP.
*Most* proxy machines operate on port 8080 but not always. Email the
admin and ask. Be polite :) In Internet Explorer, click View|Options|
then click on the 'Connection' tab and set it up a la Netscape.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- Once you have done this properly, you're
real IP address won't show up on: Guestbooks, counterlogs. WWW Boards.
Java/html chat rooms. Anonymous FTP through your browser. Cookies will
be useless. So don't bother with the anonymizer. Allowed into
'customer only' FTP servers. Many isp's have 'customer only' sections
of their web sites (through CGI) you can access them and find out
stuff about their servers, get free counters etc.   *Also* if you have
a "web email" account (Hotmail, Rocketmail, etc.) if you post a
message through the web interface, the IP of the proxy and *not* that
of yours will show up.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- A WORD OF WARNING. It is probably not safe
to use the proxy for hacking (denial of service attacks via anon ftp
or whatever) as the owner of the proxy machine would probably give
away your IP address to whoever you've been picking on. *Also* some
squid (common) proxies do give your real IP for certain cgi requests.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- Here are some proxy machines:

proxy.cybercity.dk:8080 <Denmark>
proxy.mersinet.co.uk:8080 <England>
proxy.compuserve.com:8080

Lots more out there but I don't wanna make it too easy :)
