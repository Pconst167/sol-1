Sprint will recognize any individual who has a permanent impairment

himself or herself, perform manual tasks, walk, see, hear, speak, breathe,
learn, or work, as a prospect for Disabled Membership.  Prospects must
submit their name, address, telephone number (and PC Pursuit ID if an 
existing customer).  Additionally, they must submit one of the 
following: (1.) a letter from a licensed physician describing
the prospect's disability and how it substantially limits one or more
of the major life activities listed above or (2.) a copy of an award 
letter from the Social Security Administration for Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) or Disability benefits.  If the award letter is
not dated within the last 12 months please provide a copy of a 
current benefit statement as well.  Such letters and statements can 
be obtained from local SSA offices or by the calling the SSA toll 
free number 1-800-772-1213.
