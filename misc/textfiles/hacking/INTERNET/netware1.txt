The First part of StuBoy's Netware hacking tips... compliments of StuBoy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are not really hacking tips, but, more of a command guide useful
for whatever.  (he he he)

This explains about the rights of Novell Netware 3.12
The rest of the parts will need the preknowldge of the rights of Novell.
These are mostly harmless and can be played around with, 
**** with the exception of the EXUCUTE ONLY attrib. ******

Rights explained- (My short summary)- In netware users have set rights 
attached to their login scripts of where they can go, what they can view,
and what they can do.  The way rights work is like this....

		    A DIRECTORY TREE

			 root           (the root dir)
			   |
		    |-------------|     
		courses        public   (courses and public are sub dirs
		   |              |         of root)
	     |----------|     |---------|
	  students   admin   dos       win  (sub dirs of COURSES and PUBLIC)

:if you have any rights to courses then you have the same rights to the sub
   dirs and their sub dirs and...  *Unless the sysop changes the IRM (below)

*file rights work on a one file basis.
---------------------------------------

*purging- this command is used through out- (summary)- When files are 
   deleted in NetWare, NetWare saves them in salvagable state until disk 
   space is needed, then it just writes over them.  There is a NetWare 
   utility called SALVAGE which allows a user to "undelete" files that have 
   not been purged.  Purging (explain in part two) clears these files from
   the server so they may not be SALVAGED.

*The commands to add and modify Netware rights/file attribs/dir attribs are 
NOT dos functions. They will be explained in part two.

---- All right abbrevs are in the same case as seen in NetWare.

1:Trustee Rights (user rights)
Name            Abbreviation    Explanation
----            ------------    -----------

-Read           R               dir-open/read files in dir
				file-open/read file

-Write          W               dir-open/write to files in dir
				file-open/write file

-Create         C               dir-create subdirs, files,and write to files
				file-allows salvage (see salvage in work
				    station utils-part two)

-Erase          E               dir-del dir,files, and sub dirs
				file-del file

-Modify         M               dir-change name/attrib of dirs/sub dirs
				   and file attribs

-File Scan      F               dir-view file names and sub dirs
				file-view file name

-Access Control A               dir-change dir IRM and trustee assignments
				file-change file IRM and trustee assignments
				   (see IRM below)

-Supervisory    S               dir-all rights to files and sub dirs
				file-all rights to file
				   * supervisory rights cannot be removed *


*** IRM- Inhetited Rights Mask- allows the sysop to block certain rights, 
   of the sub dirs, from the parent dirs.  (if you have questions email me)
   (this is only way I can think of the descibe this right now)
