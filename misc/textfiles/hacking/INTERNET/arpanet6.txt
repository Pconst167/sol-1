       Hacking ARPANET -- Part VI

               The Source


***************************************


     This last part of the Hacking ARPANET series provides some more iformation
on the types of things that you can learn from the EXEC, and concludes by
explaining how to log onto the system and how passwords are structured.

     Once you are onto the EXEC, as explained in Part I, you should get into
the QUERY function which is also explained earlier.  QUERY will tell you just
about all you need to know about anyone, including their business phone numbers
and the locations of certain military employees.

 NIC/Query is a database system containing information about the Defense Data
Network (DDN)...
   1. INTERNET PROTOCOLS -- Describes Internet protocols
   2. PROGRAMS -- Describes programs available on DDN hosts
   3. PERSONNEL -- Directory of DDN users
   4. HOSTS -- Describes DDN hosts

     We have selected menu item 4, "HOSTS".

HOSTS -- Describes DDN hosts
   1. BY NAME -- Description of hosts by DDN hostname
   2. BY CPU -- List of hosts by CPU type
   3. BY OS -- List of hosts by Operating System

     If we were especially interested in working on one or another computer, a
CRAE, for example, we would select menu item 2. Or, if we wanted to learn a new
operating system, we could select menu item 3. But let's see what's available
under menu item 1:



HOSTS BY NAME -- Description of hosts by DDN hostname
To show the entry for a host, type its official name or nickname.
To get a menu of hostnames, select the appropriate choice below.

AI-HANDBOOK
The AI Handbook is aimed at making the results of AI research accessible to
the large, multi-disciplinary community of scientists who want to build AI
systems in their own problem areas.  Students and researchers at Stanford
and other AI laboratories have prepared over 300 short articles describing the
fundamental ideas, useful thechniques, and exemplary programs developed in the
field over the last 20 years.  These articles have been written for computer-
literate scienists and engineers in other fields who are unfamiliar with AI
reserch and jargon.  The Handbook will provide a scientist who, for instnce,
might want to knoge" front end, with information about all of the relevant AI
techniques and existing systems, as well as abundant pointers into the field's
literature.

ASSIST
ASSIST is a compiler fo a large subset of the IBM Assembler Language
instruction set.  ASSIST is oriented toward instructional use but is also
useful for program checkout.  ASSIST features simplified I/O statements and
detailed assembly and execution error messages.  ASSIST was developed at
Pennsylvania State University and the University of Tennessee.

Acquisition of Cognitive Procedures, combines a semantic network data-base with
a production system to simulate human cognition.  ACT possesses a number of
learning mechanisms which have been used to model the learning of procedural
skills such as language comprehension and geometry theorem proving.  It can also
model human limitations.

last name followed by three periods, e.g., Sm...)

LOGIN
-----

     ARPANET very graciously tells us just about all we know to be able to log
into the system in the related HELP file below:

 .HELP LOGIN
Only people with authorized accounts may log in on this system, though some
programs can be run without logging in.  Type "HELP GUEST" for a list of these
"free" programs.  Type "HELP ACCOUNT" for information on opening an account.
 To log in, type the word LOGIN (this may be abbreviated L) followed by a
space, your project name, a comma, and your programmer name:
 L PRJ,PRG
This will lo you in, and type out any system messages or personal mail for you
wich may exist.  You can stop the message typeout by typing the CALL eg
(CONTROL-C twice from other characters in place of the "," namely:
 / - types only system messages that have been posted since you last logged in.
 . - suppresses all messages.
 % - lets you specify a new password.
In order to log in from the network or remotely, you must have a password.
For a more complete description of LOGIN options, see the printed Monitor
Command Manual or its online version MONCOM.BH[S,DOC], whose updates are in
MONCOM.UPD[S,DOC].


     Rembember, ARPANET has already shown us how to find out the PRG
(programmer name) part of the login:
 .FINGER INT where INT are the initials of a programmer.  If the initials don't
exist you will get an error message.  Keep trying until you find the correct
initials.
     Passwords are often the same as the programmer's initials.  If not, then
try the programmer's first name which you can learn from using the Personnel
option on the menu in the Exec's QUERY.
     Once you have a password, you may then log onto just about any ARPANET
computer.  Instead of typing "O 0,11", enter the machine's NetWork number!
     All that's left to be hacked is the first section of the logon code --
the PRJ name, which may be as long as three letters and which may include
nubmers.

     HAPPY HACKING!
