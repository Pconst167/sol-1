 "TELENET TERMINAL IDENTIFIERS"
 ------------------------------




THIS IS A LIST OF THE TERMINAL IDENTIFIERS FOR TELENET AND THE SYSTEM TYPES THEY REPRESENT. REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST LOGON THE INITIAL (FIRST) QUESTION ASKED IS:
TERMINAL=

THIS LIST SHOULD PROVIDE YOU WITH ALL KNOW AVAILABLE TERMINAL TYPES. YOU MAY WISH TO MAKE NOTE THAT PERSONAL COMPUTERS USUALLY USE THE IDENTIFIER D1.

HOW TO HACK TELENET:

----------------------

 OKAY, SO YOU WANT TO TRY YOUR HAND AT FINDING SOME JUICY
COMPUTERS, HUH? WELL, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...................
FIRST, FIND OUT YOUR LOCAL TELENET ACCESS PHONE NUMBER.    
(THIS SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD IF YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND  WITH A  
SOURCE ACCOUNT) HAVE HIM TYPE 'TYMTEL' FROM THE COMMAND MODE.
THEN, DIAL UP AND REPLY 'D1' TO THE 'TERMINAL=' PROMPT.    
(THIS GETS RID OF ALL THOSE NULLS AT THE END OF EACH LINE.) 
NOW, TYPE 'C AAANN' WHERE AAA IS THE AREACODE OF THE COMPUTER
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, AND NN IS ANY NUMBER.. (START WITH 15 OR
20 îRQVêWORK BEST.) AFTER HITTING RETURN OR ENTER, YOU SHOULD
GET SOME SORT OF MESSAGE. IF IT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE 'NOT   
OPERATING' GIVE UP ON THAT NUMBER AND TRY ANOTHER. THE GOAL
HERE IS TO GET 'AAA NN CONNECTED'. ONCE CONNECTED, TRY A FEW
RETURNS, AND YOU'LL USUALLY GET A SIGNON PROMPT. THE OTHER.
GIVEAWAY ERRORS ARE 'AAA NN REJECTING' AND 'AAA NN REFUSED 
COLLECT CONNECTION'.THESE MEAN THERE ARE COMPUTERS THERE,BUT
THEY ARE UNREACHABLE.'INVALID ADDRESS' MEANS THERE IS NOTHING
CONNECTED. SOME "RIPE" AREACODES ARE 204 (CANADA) AND 415 IN
CALIFORNIA. GIVE IT A TRY AND LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!!!!


THE TELENET SYSTEM HAS A FEW COMMANDS OF ITS OWN. THESE ARE
VERY USEFUL FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, THE MOST USEFUL BEING THE
ABILITY TO DISCONNECT FROM A NODE WITHOUT HANGING UP THE
PHONE. (THUS MAKING IT EASIER TO TRY ANOTHER NODE ADDRESS).
I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SUMMARIZE TELENET'S COMMANDS BELOW:


   COMMAND      EFFECT

   -------      ------

    HALF       SETS NET HALF-DUPLEX. (ECHO)


    FULL       SETS NET FULL-DUPLEX. (NO ECHO)


  C AAA NN     CONNECT THE NODE ADDRESSED BY AAANN WHERE AAA

               IS A VALID US TELEPHONE AREACODE, AND NN IS

               ANY 2-DIGIT NUMBER.


     D         DISCONNECT NODE, IF STILL ATTACHED.


    ID         UNKNOWN - PROBABLY AN ID FOR NODES WITH

               SECURITY CHECKING.  [ NO IDEA OF PASSWORD

               FORMAT 


NOTE: THE ONLY WAY TO USE THE DISCONNECT COMMAND IS TO GET
      THE NET'S ATTENTION FIRST. ASSUMING YOU ARE CONNECTED
      TO A VALID NODE, THIS IS DONE BY TYPING THE SEQUENCE:
      <RETURN> FOLLOWED BY THE "AT" SIGN, AND ANOTHER
      <RETURN>.  IF IT IS EXECUTED CORRECTLY, THE WORD
      TELENET WILL APPEAR AS WELL AS ANOTHER "AT" SIGN. YOU
      MAY NOW ENTER "D" AND DISCONNECT FROM THE NODE.

             ACCESS TO TELENET VIA INTERNATIONAL TELEX
 
 
 
International users can access hosts on Telenet via International Telex.
The user follows local procedures and places a prepaid Telex call from
his terminal to the Telex number listed below.  There, Baudot-ASCII
conversion is performed.  The user then logs into his host.  The user
is billed localy for placing a Telex call from his international
location.  For additional information please contact your local
GTE Telenet Sales Office.

Tariff Structure For Legitimate Customers
 
For calls originating from/to Datapac/Telenet, kilopackets rates are
based on a tierred band structure.
 
Rate structure is based on the following:
 
For Telenet/USA to Datapac/Canada or Datapac/Canada to Telenet/USA
calls:
 
    Where is the call originating?
    If from Telenet/USA, is the call public dial or other?
    If call is public dial, then the rate is $4.50/hour plus kilopacket
    charge by band, (reference band chart below).
 
    If other type of call (private dial, DAF, or X.25), then there is
    a kilopacket charge for data transmitted.
 
    If call originates from Datapac/Canada, band needs to be determined.
    If service is Datapac 3000, then only kilopacket charge applies.
    If service is Datapac 3101, then $2.70/hour connect charge plus
    kilopacket charge by band is applicable.
