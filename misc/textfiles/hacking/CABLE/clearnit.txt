Ya! School is finally out! It's a 
warm 70 degrees with no wind, the 
stars are bright, and the moon is 
full-not a cloud in the sky! Scince 
the BBS's aren't able to be logged on 
to until after everyone is asleep, 
why not get a friend or two and go 
outside?

 Remote Controller For Cable Boxes
 On Your Block

 You might want to have a backpack 
dark in color to stuff all of this 
in!

:=> During Daylight Hours
 Scout out the storm drainage system 
underneath your block. This will be 
beneficial later. Steal some steel 
rods about 4 feet long from a nusery 
or someplace like that and hide them 
near each manhole cover. Draw a map 
of, or memorize the sewer system so 
you now where you are going in the 
dark!
 Find all the bedrooms of the 
good-looking chicks on your block, or 
at least the ones with big tits. Also 
find bushes, or a place to hide a 
moderate distance away from their 
bedroom window. Far enough not to be 
seen, close enough for the 230mm lens 
or the telescope. Draw a map or 
memorize.
 Plot escape routes or places to hide 
incase someone comes out a door, or a 
car drives by. These will be more 
important than you think.
 But most important of all, you 
should memorize the bowels of your 
neighborhood, so you know where you 
are going when ther is little or no 
light.

:=> Now It's DARK!!
 Wait until it's really dark and get 
your dark clothes on and don your 
backpack. Get your friend(s) and 
let's go! Sneak around for a while if 
this is your first time, and get to 
know everything in the dark. Get that 
map of where to hide and look in 
windows. Go to some place and try it 
out. If no one is getting ready for 
ed yet, see waht they are having for 
dinner. Eventually, they will have to 
go to bed! We've pulled some 
all-nighters, but it's paid off! You 
might want to bring aloksome food 
and have a snack while you wait.
 About 9:00 or so, everyone is 
watching TV. All the cable boxes on 
our block are rigged for remote 
controllers. And guess who has a 
spare? You guessed it! The same guys 
ewith the black backpack! It's a real 
blast changing channels on them or 
turning the power off or the volume 
up! You will have to get almost up to 
the window for some remotes. Be 
careful. This is especially effective 
if the TV set comes on at 3:00 AM!
 Still got your BB gun? Pump it up 
around 5 times depending on how far 
away you are and how powerful your 
gun is. Now aim at the post lamp or 
the light above their garage or door. 
Have you ever seen a 300w 
incandescant bulb explode after being 
hit with a BB? If a squirrel scares 
the shit out of you, waste him, too.
Grab some money. Because now we're 
going to 7-11! Ditch the backpack in 
an out of the way place where nobody 
can find it when you are going in to 
7-11. The How To Rob A 7-11 article 
would be especially helpful here.
 Find a way onto everyone's roof 
making as little noise as possible. 
You get a great view of evryone 
else's second story window from up 
here!
 Lots of times on our block, the chicks
that live here bring their boyfriends
over and make out on the back porch.
Whip out the shutgun mike and make
tape of it, use the CCD or 35mm to
'Capture The Memories', and when you're
sick to your stomach, scream some
vulger terms or launch bottle rockets
at them.
 Oh Boy! GARBAGE NIGHT! People have to
mow their lawn in the summer, right?
Well, at least some people do! I know
I don't! Grass is put into waht?
GRASS BAGS! Waht do the garbage men
do with these? They just pick them up
and sling 'em in the back of the truck.
Wouldn't it be a shame if there was a
hole in the bottom of the bag made with
a knife and the grass went all over
the curb? I guess you get the hint!
Have you ever stolen a garbage can?
Makes the old people on our block
REALLY pissed! I guess they have a
passion for garbage cans! Metal ones
are a lot easier to crush and hide in
the woods than plastic, though. But
have you ever heard an M80 go off in
metal can? More or less a Hefty bag?
Not as tough as they say! Still got
a metal can that you stole? Cut the
bottom out and then take it to a
house with another metal can. Place
yours down on the street and don't move
it. Transfer all the trash from the
goos one into yours. Now steal the
good one and wait for garbagemen to
try and pick up the trick can! Ha-ha!
 This last one you will have to be
real careful with! Even we don't like
to do it that much, but it can be done!
Sometimes, the dumb neighbors leave
their sliding glass doors open to
ventalate the house and then forget
to close them when they go to bed.
Hungry? This gives you access to the
kitchen! Don't stop to make a 
sandwich, just take all the lunchmeat
and run!
