                 A Guide to the Chicago Cable System Part 1

         Rather than starting things off with a desciption of what is 
really going on out there, here is a quick and easy way to start saving 
money off of your monthly cable bill. This of course only applies if you 
already have the basic service and your Cable company is Group W of Chicago.

         In future parts we will be discussing the Scientific Atlanta which 
is being used on the south and eastern parts of the city. For the first few 
parts most of the info contained applies to the Jerrold 450 system which 
Group W is using throughout tHe remainder of the city. It should be noted that in some areas Group W is using a decoder made by Pioneer which for all practical purposes is the same as the Jerrold 450. Why they are doing this will be covered in a future i
stallment.

         now onto the good stuff......

How to really get something for nothing (almost).

         Group W is no different than the other 1000 cable systems across 
the country. It, like them, are run by a bunch of money hungry bastard 
executives who do little else than come up with ways to charge you more for 
less service.

One of the 'high level' services is the FM broadcast service which allows 
the consumer (sucker) to get simulcasted audio of the premium movie 
channels over his/her fm stereo.Along with them you get a handful of the 
local fm/am stations that unfortunetly there not where they are supposed to 
be. (see chart at end).

         To explain the simulcast theory, the best way to do it is to bring 
up other examples. If you go back awhile, one of the first proven attempts 
was the old ABC-TV series call "In Concert". You would tune your tv to 
channel 7,turn the sound off and tune your fm stereo to what was then WDAI 
(94.7). More recent examples are several specials shown on WTTW (ch.11) and 
the audio on WFMT, along with the first year of "Friday Night Videos" shown 
on WMAQ-TV and the audio over WLUP (97.9).

         Over the air simulcasting isn't done much anymore with the advent 
of the "MTS Stereo Decoder" but the pigs at Group W think differently. Why 
should they allow the sucker (consumer) to get free stereo with his stereo 
ready tv/vcr when they can charge extra for it? I mean whats the point in 
allowing someone who paid probably $200 extra for the feature get a free 
ride on the cable system? Bear in mind that only WMAQ and WTTW are full 
time stereo locally but almost all f the 'premium' station are.

Well here is the bad news, Group W doesn't put in (or allow to pass) the 
MTS stereo signal needed for the stereo ready tv and vcr's to work. They 
have a 'better' alternative. (even though the jerrold 450 is capable of 
passing the signal).

         The Optional FM hookup is how they sell it. Its only $2.50 extra 
on installation ($30 if commercial) and $2 a month ($10 if commerical). Yes 
thats right, for only $24.00 extra a year you can kick yourself in the ass 
for paying for your cable ready stereo tv only to find out neither the 
cable tuner nor stereo decoder is worth squat.

This mod won't help you fix a mistake, but at least in 10 years or so you 
can recover the expense. And for everyone else this might prevent you from 
spending money without good cause. To do this right, you will need the 
following items:

                        1- 2 way 75 ohm cable coupler
                        1- 75-300 ohm matching transformer
                        2- pieces of coax cable with ends,one
                           short (about 2 feet or so) the other
                           long enough to run from the decoder
                           atop your tv to your fm stereo.

If you have no idea what any of the above items are, simply print this file 
out and bring it to your local Radio Shack dealer. I find they are most 
helpful when it comes to aiding cable consumers (suckers).

         All you have to do is follow the next diagram. In words all you 
are going to do is unscrew the cable coming from the wall to the 'cable in' 
jack on the back of the decoder, screw the cable into the input of the 2 
way coupler, run the short coax from one of the outs of the coupler back to 
the jack on the decoder where you unplugged it, then take the longer piece 
of coax and run it from the other output of the coupler to the 75-300 
transformer which in turn will go on the fm-ant screws on the back of your 
fm stereo radio.

                           attach these to ends to the fm
                           antenna screws on the back of
                           your fm stereo. (300 ohm inputs)


         Thats about all there is to it. The total cost is about $3-$5 
depending on the lenghts of coax you get. The cost to Group W is about a 
dollar for the same stuff. Well worth the $2 a month they charge extra for. 
Now that you have things attached ere is a run down of the stations in case 
you don't have the offical list:

Gala      (video on 50)   audio on 102.1
BET       (video on 52)   audio on 105.3


         All ya have to do now is tune the decoder to the channel you want, 
turn the sound off, turn on your fm radio and tune it to the matching 
frequency for the audio. Of course if you are not paying for any of the 
'premium' channels you aren't going to get a picture, but that will be 
covered in one of the next parts. (hehehhehehe).

         A few notes... First off if you are already paying for the fm 
service, you can cancel it and do the above to re-attach it. They will 
explain to you that if they send one of their highly qualified techs out to 
disconnect it, it will cost you $25 or the service call. If you ask them if 
you can do it yourself, they will tell you yes and to disconnect the 75-300 
ohm transformer from the radio and bring it into the office on Milwaukee 
ave. Since you are leaving the 2 way coupler and coax cable, on the way 
back from the office drop by Radio Shack and pick up a new transformer. You 
won't need anything else.

        Another thing is don't lose any sleep about them catching you with 
an illegal tap on the line.Unless you are stupid enough to let them in to 
inspect the wiring there really is no other way for them to know. The 
system they installed so far is no setup for "line testing" so it is next 
to impossible for them to detect it from outside of the house. Also note 
that the fm-service cannot be cut-off like they do if ya have a non- 
authorized remote control.


         Well have loads of fun and enjoy.......
