<H1>Hacking Textfiles: Cable TV</H1>
<P>
Free Cable TV has always been a prized holy grail by people of all kinds in
this country, and throughout the years a cottage industry has risen up to give
the people What They Want. Beyond the immediate satisfaction of free TV, of
course, are the fascinating lengths that the industry goes to to scramble
signals so only authorized customers can have the precious signals.
