VOYAGER -- MS-DOS Videocrypt smart card emulator
------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------
Voyager is named after the new StarTrek 'Voyager' series.
Most of the information about the videocrypt protocol is found in
details.txt written by Markus Kuhn.
This new file (VOYAGER.DOC) is a container for additional information
about the videocrypt system (cards series 09, 0a and further) and
also some additional information about the eurocrypt system.

The archive file contains the voyager.exe program, which is compatible
with season programs.
Voyager currently emulates a BskyB 07/09-series smartcard, The Adult-Channel
smartcard, Eurotica smartcard, RedHot smartcard and EuroCrypt smartcards
with all ECM's until release date included.

ATTENTION
---------
We are now using two version numbers (1.3i) that is Voyager/Season71 release,
and Key release (1.1) that will be used to know if Eurocrypt keys had been
updated.

D2Mac CARD
----------
This version is supporting both Eurocrypt and Videocrypt.
Selection is done automaticaly. Various keys are implemented.

SKY 0A CARD
-----------
Sky has send out some new cards, decoem say it's card issue 10.
Read commands for the 09 are failing.

LAST D2MAC Key changes
----------------------
21-12-95 TV3 Sweden switched back to key 0a
20-12-95 TV3 Denmark switched back to key 0a
06-12-95 TV3 Sweden/Denmark changed to key 0b
04-12-95 TV3 Norway changed to key 0b
24-09-95 Filmnet and TV1000 changed keys
28-04-95 TV3 changed the key
01-02-95 TV1000 changed keys

LAST SKY ECM's
--------------
31-10-95 The big change from card 09 to card 10.
18-09-95 Code change, nanocommands are gone again.
         Sky is sending some strange '85' packets, card 10 commands ??
16-09-95 Sky tested some codes, resulting in 'no key fits'.
         Is Sky testing 0a cards or have they found something new...
15-09-95 Code change, nanocommands are back, (old) nanosequence 0x09, 0x28,
         0x39,0x46. Several other programs got defeated, many old versions
         started to work again, Voyager survived once again.
         It took some time but the change of 12-09-95 was for this ECM.
12-09-95 Code change, no nanocommands are being send anymore.
         Also some changes to the sub-id's: Nickelodeon was added to the
         tables.
         The last few times this happend it was for short periods
         and followed by an actual ECM.
         If no nanocommand are being send, all clonecards and programs
         are working.
01-09-95 Code change, Voyager could handle it so no changes needed.
         Several others where defeated once again.
         Now subnano 0xbf, 0xc0 and 0xaa are in use.
15-08-95 Code change, fixed (changing the nanopointer 0xee, subnano without
         effect 0x88 because it's used by the kernel)
         skip 30 00 after 11 0A 00 EE
01-08-95 Code change, fixed (new nanocommand 0x0f and subnano's 0xbf, 0xc0)
28-06-95 Code change, Sky cleaned-up the nanocommand code.
         now only nanocommand 0x28 is in use.
         Voyager was allready prepared for this ECM.
         MTV also started to transmit VC encoded.
15-06-95 Code change, fixed 0xE7.. is ram not rom.
         pick up data byte 0xE7 from rom.
17-05-95 Code change, fixed nano-command switching between rompages.
         new nano subcommand for the nano 11h command: subcommand 08
         means: switching between rompage 1 and rompage 2
06-04-95 Code change, Nanocommands are back
15-03-95 Code change, no Nanocommands are being send anymore.
         Bit 5 in the channel-id is set.
08-03-95 Code change, adressing of packets is changed.
03-02-95 Code change, Rom-Page 0 is being used, 10 sec. picture,
         2.5 sec. no picture.
25-01-95 Code change, 7.5 sec. picture, 5 sec. no picture.
18-01-95 Code change
16-01-95 Code change

LAST TAC/EUROTICA ECM's
-----------------------
29-11-95 Code change, Eurotica changed but is still decoded.
01-09-95 Code change, The Adult Channel changed but is still decoded.
14-06-95 Code change, The Adult Channel switched back to the old keys.
         Voyager gets switch key 'J' to protect against PS ECM and a larger
         key table.
         Also autoswitch funtion implemented.
24-05-95 Code change, the ECM of 24-5-95 is called Perry Smith ECM
         last 64 itteration with constant 0x0d as input.
15-05-95 Code change
16-02-95 Code change
18-01-95 Code change

SUB-CHANNEL I.D.
----------------
The information below is only for Sky 09/07 cards:
The sub-id is found in the low nibble (4 bits) of indata[5], if indata[3]+0x02
not equals indata[7] and indata[7]+0x02 not equals indata[3] or indata[3]+0x08.
equals indata[7].
The MultiChannels ID is now only for Sky One, Sky Soap and The Travel Channel.
Sky sports 2 uses the Sky sports ID.
All other channels are correctly identified using this method.

New id-f is used for all 'open videocrypt' channels like Sky News, CNE,
TVX freeview block, Hour of Power and non-decoded announcements like Showcase.
QVC still uses its own sub-id in the multichannels package.

AUTO DELAYS
-----------
By detecting the CPU type inside voyager and combining the results of many
reactions from Voyager users, Voyager has now an automatic delay.
It's still possible that the standard settings don't work, in that case
the auto delay can be overruled by setting the wa/wb/wc parameters on startup.
The auto delay detection can be activated with the 'A' parameter at start-up.

Most common settings are:

     XT's 86/88/V20/V30 : Voyager 1 wa50 wb0
     286 up to 16 MHz   : Voyager 1 wa50 wb0
     386 up to 40 MHz   : Voyager 1 wa50 wb1
     486 up to 100 MHz  : Voyager 1 wa50 wb2
     Pentium            : Voyager 1 wa50 wb2

All settings are also checked on old and new videocrypt chipsets.

ZKT
---
VideoCrypt decoders contain a few built-in algorithms to prevent pirate
cards from being used. However due to a programming error on many of the
original decoders and IRDs (integrated receiver/descramblers), the most
powerful algorithm, the Fiat-Shamir zero-knowledge test, did not work
properly. On the newer videocrypt systems this error is fixed.
Voyager is patched and now acts exactly the same as the original cards
preventing the decoder to see it's not an original card.

VOYAGER.EXE: usage
-------------------
Syntax:
VOYAGER [com] [wax] [wbx] [wcx] [wdx] [wex] [a] [d] [e] [i] [j] [m] [n] [q] [v] [t] [z]

com: Serial port to use.

wa thru we are delays, all entered in ms (milliseconds)
wa wait between reset and answer to reset
wb wait after each outgoing byte
wc wait between header and first procedure byte
wd wait between procedure byte and data
we wait between final data byte and procedure bytes

a: Videocrypt Automatic delay setting.
d: debug mode on when program is started.
e: save time by doing less screen updates.
i: Displays channelnames by sub-id for debugging.
j: Switches between Adult keys before and after 24th may ECM.
m: OSD suppress.
n: Display nanoinfo on startup.
q: Quick decoding mode.
v: Show hexnumbers in o.s.d. on startup.
z: set baud rate at 10000 baud.

defaults are:
com: 2
wa: 50
wb: 0
wc: 0
wd: 0
we: 0
dn: debug mode n on.
e: no time saving
m: no OSD suppression
n: don't show nanoinfo
vn: viewmode n on.
jn: Adult ECM switching mode n on.

Example: VOYAGER 1 wa0 wb0 m
starts voyager using comport 1 with reset delay and byte delay set at
0 milliseconds, and with onscreen display suppressed.

Voyager is patched to work on Pace MSS systems
if your decoder locks-up use the wc parameter. wc150000 seems to work on
some systems but you might try other values.
After implementing the ZKT, the wc parameter may not be needed.
It works fine on my MSS system.
