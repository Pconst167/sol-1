        If you are not fortunate enough to have premium 
services like show time and cinimax andany other service that appears
to be fuzzy that you can almost get by fine tuning!
it also works on channels that are lined and flashing and produce a
 mixed up picture.

these channels are not scrambled!!!
but instead a garbage transmission
is sent at the same frequency
therefor in order to filter the garbage out you must first examine the
terminals these are the ones that the cable service is hooked up to .
get a peaice of antenna wire about
3 feet long and attach t to the 
vhf terminals along with the cable
tune in one of the movie services
that you would like to see and adjust it for the clearest possible
do this again and again untill you get an almost perfect picture!
(you should not have to cut off any more that 6 inches of that 3 foot
wire.
now get a peice of aluminum foil and wrap it around that wire and slide
it up or down till you get a perfect picture and good voice and thats
 how to get movies for free!!
