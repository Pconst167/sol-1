You will need:
--------------
Underground Cable Source
Neighbor
2 Way Signal Spliter
1 Foot Of 75ohm Coax Cable
A Cable Ready T.V.
Basic Cable Subscription For A Month



1. Order cable for 1 month...This way they will bury the cable in your 
yard,saving you a lot of work...
2. After your one month cable subscription is up and they have come and
taken your box, go out to your cable box and hook the end of the wire that
goes to your house to one of the outputs on the signal splitter...
3. Disconnect the wire going to your neighbors house from the cable source
and connect to the other output on the signal splitter...
4. Now hook the 1 foot section of wire between the input on your splitter
and where your neighbors wire was connected to the cable source...
5. Now go in the house and hook the end of the wire that was hooked to 
your inside cable box to the coax fitting on the back of your T.V..
6. Turn your T.V. on,you should now have whatever cable your neighbors
have...


Precautions:
-----------

If your cable goes out that means that your neighbors cable is also out..
So you better go out and make the box look normal again,before the cable 
repair man comes or you will be up shit's creek...
When disconnecting your neighbors cable from the box you should make sure
that they are not watching T.V..A good way to make sure is to go borrow 
a cup of milk...Or better yet do it at 3 in the morning...
