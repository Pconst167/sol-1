         =======================================

Below you find a table with different pc's (cpu's) and decoders with
the neccesary running settings.
Best thing is to run your pc as clean as possible eg. no resident programs.
All settings are for VideoCrypt-1, EuroCrypt mode uses different settings.

--==< All PC's with Pace MSS systems >==--
Voyager is patched to work with Pace MSS systems but if your decoder
locks-up use the wc parameter. wc150000 seems to work on some
systems but you might have to try other values.
All problems with Pace decoders are solved with the implementation of the ZKT.
On Pace MSS systems you can also try to use the second card slot as this
one doesn't have the ZKT implemented.
Also you might try to set the 'wb' parameter until the 'online' message is
flashing and use the 'M' parameter to getrid of on-screen messages.
