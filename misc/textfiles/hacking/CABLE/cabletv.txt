

  With most of the cable companies

scrambling their signals on most all

new and some old channels I thought I'd

update and revise my first version

(1.0) of Pay Tv Decoder Plans.

  Due to different scrambling systems,

you might find it neccesary to change

the range and values of the variable

capacitator.  I've also added a

wiring diagram to help you with design-

ing the circut.  If you have any

questions just leave a message on the

board listed at the end of the article.

     ///PAY TV DECODER PLANS///

             Version 2.0





      ///MATERIALS REQUIRED:///




1   - Radio Shack mini-box ( #270-235)

1   - 1/4 watt resistor, 2.2k-2.4k ohm

      (RS #271-1325)

1   - 75pf-100pf variable capacitor

      (Very hard to find)

2   - F61a chassis-type coaxial

      connectors (RS #278-212)

12" - No. 12 solid copper wire

12" - RG59 coaxial cable





          ///INSTRUCTIONS///



1.  Bare a length of No. 12 gauge solid

copper wire and twist around a 3/8"

nail or rod to form a coil of 9 turns.

Elongate coil to a length of 1 1/2"

inches and form right angle bends on

each end.



2.  Solder the varible capacitor to

the coil. It doesn't matter where you

solder it, it still does the same job.

The best place for it is in the center

with the adjustment screw facing upward



Note: When it comes time to place coil

in box, the coil must be insulated from

grounding.  This can be done by crazy-

glueing a piece of rubber to the bottom

of the box, and securing the coil to it.



3.  Tap coil at points 2 1/2 turns from

ends of coil and solder to coaxial

chassis connectors, bringing tap leads

through holes in chassis box.  Use as

little wire as possible.



4.  Solder resistor to center of coil

and ground other end of resistor to

chassis box, using solder lug and small

screw.



Diagram: Your circut and design should

look something like this:

    ----------------------------



5.  Drill a 1/2" diameter hold in mini-

box cover to permit adjustment of the

variable capacitor from the outside.

Inspect the device for defects in

workmanship and place cover on mini-

box.  Tighten securely.



6.  Place device in line with existing

cable on either side of the coverter

box and connect to television set with

the short piece of RG59 coaxial cable.

Set television set to HBO channel.



7.  Using a plastic screwdriver (non-

metallic), adjust the varible capacitor

until picture tunes in.  Sit back,

relax, and enjoy!!!





Have fun...
