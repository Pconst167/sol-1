             JANET PAD listing - revision 1.2 - 1st March 1990

Hi everyone...

Here's a list of dial-up PAD's that will give you access to the JANET network!
Unless stated, these all use 7 data bits, even parity and one stop bit.
I've also given the baud rates where I know them (V21=300, V22=1200, V22bis=2400
, and V23=1200/75)

When you've got through to the PAD, you might get a 'Which Service?' prompt.
If so, type 'PAD<cr>'. Sometimes you'll need to hit <cr> a few times to get
a response from the machine.

Once you're at the 'PAD>' prompt (you might need to hit 'Return' a few times
to wake up the PAD), you can call any computer system on JANET by entering
'CALL xxxxxxxxxxxx', where 'xxxxxxxxxxxx' is the 12- or 14-digit network
address of the machine in question. Note that JANET will only get you as the
remote computer's login screen - from there on you are on your own and will
have to find/guess ID's and passwords...

To start you off, two excellent public-access systems exist on JANET that are
CRAMMED with info and useful clues for would-be hackers!

These are:      JANET News Machine: 000050005002 (login as 'NEWS' - no password
                                                  needed)
                NISS Bulletin Board:000062200000

These two systems will give you plenty of starting points for possible hacks
(net addresses etc). But make sure that you're on a local call if possible -
before I found these PAD numbers, I spent 3 hours on a long-distance call to
the Janet News Machine!!!

Hope this info is of use and interest - leave a msg for 'Boris' on GoobTel
(0602-706307;V21/23) if you have questions/comments/suggestions/good passwords!!

One more thing - try calling 000002010001 - this is a PD software archive
run by Lancaster Uni. - they carry s/w for PC, ST, Amiga, BBC and (I think)
other machines as well. Eventually I'll put up a file on here going into
more detail...(by the way, you'll need to login with username 'pdsoft' and
password 'pdsoft' - both in lower case)

Bye for now, and have great fun - I did!

Cheers, Boz

                   UPDATES WITH THIS REVISION (1.3):

Added Leeds Uni's PAD (0532-461514).
Changed the line format slightly to squeeze in more comments.
Changed the format of the introductory notes to make them more readable (!)
Changed all London 01 codes to the new 071/081 format.

REVISION 1.2 (1 Mar '90)
Another name change - to JPADxx.TXT. Hopefully this is easier to type - and
leaves me a bit of room for extending the filename if necessary!

ULCC's V23 node (071-831-6181) is actually 8-N-1 and not 7-E-1 as listed in
previous revisions.

The PAD's which I have actually tested and found to work OK are now marked
with asterisks (*).

In the introductory note, I have now mentioned the systems that prompt 'Which
Service?' instead of dropping straight into the PAD. Hopefully this will sort
out a few problems people might be having.

REVISION 1.1 (18th Feb '90)
Lancaster Uni's PAD actually uses 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit instead of
7-E-1! Apologies for the error...

No more mistakes detected so far...!

Cheers, Boz
