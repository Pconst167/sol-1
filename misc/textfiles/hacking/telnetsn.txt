    Telenet is the largest Packet Switching network, that I know of at this 
 present time, I could waste valuable buffer space explaining what packet 
 switching is and what its uses are ect...so for more information read 
 "Packet Switching (tomorrow's communications today) by Roy D. Rosner. It 
 is quite indepth and one of the books I cherish in my "legal" Telecomm 
 library. 
  
 DEFINITION of GTE TELENET : The packet switching subsidiary of General 
 Telephone and Electronics. It provides nationwide common user data           
 communications via packet switching 
   
   
 Information on GTE TELENET : 
 ---------------------------- 
  
 The GTE Telenet commercial packet switched network was developed as a  
 commercial venture of many of the same principals who developed ARPANET.  
 GTE Telenet first became in 1979.  
 
 OPERATION : 
 ------------ 
   
 Telenets network operation and internal protocals evolved from the ARPANET 
 experience , with additional cababilitys built into each of the switching  
 nodes. The network is mostly a ciruit bases packet switching protocol, that 
 does meet the requirments of the CCITT X.25 protocol at the user interface. 
 In addition, Telenet also provides customized user interfaces to meet the  
 need of the individual users. It also provides emulation interfaces. 
 
 
 USER ACCESS : 
 ------------- 
  
 User access to the network is through one of the three clases of telenet  
 central offices, such as the one in San Fran, support user access speeds up 
 to 56k bps is a Class I. Class II offices, such as the one in Spokane,Wa  
 provide connection speeds up to 9600 bps. Class III offices support rates  
 up to 1200 bps, such as the one in tucson,arizona. User access can be made  
 to Public Dialin ports, private dial in ports, or fixed ports dedicated full 
 time for a single user. Users can implement X.25 compatable software in  
 there host computer or they can just use the T-net provided interface  
 processors to provide network service. Terminal Clusters can be accessed to 
 the network very effciently by use of Telenet access controllers placed at  
 the customers residence or business,ect.. 
 
  
 Telenet Dialups 
 --------------- 
 
 To find the local Telenet dialup for your area just call WATS to 800-TEL-ENET 
 and ask them for it but remember to watch out "Every thing you do on telenet 
 is saved on Mega tape for up to 5 years, and they have installed number  
 identification since December 1987, 
  
 WATS TELENET DIALUPS.... 
  
 (800) 424-9494 300/1200 BPS 
 (800) 238-0631 2400 & MPE 
  
 These wats will change in aug. 88 so if you would like the new ones leave my 
 E-Mail on Lunitics Labs (415) 278-7421 
 
  
 What to do one you have your POTS dialup: 
 ----------------------------------------- 
  
 Remember to do any scanning on telenet you need a POTS dialup not a WATS,  
 the WATS dialup is mainly used for Telemail or GTE MAIL., or SPRINT HP's 
 Call your local dial up and you should see something that says TELENET 
 617 18m, or whatevr...just hit <REt> a few times. and you should see  
 something that looks like this. 
 
 @ 
 
 at the "@" prompt type in NPA XXX..for now just use your area code... 
 
 like this....( this is a Network User Address  or NUA) 
  
 @ 415 333 
 
 it will then either connect you, or say "Collect Connection Refused", 
 because you have not used an NUI, more on NUI's later... 
 
 you will see one of the following : 
  
 1) call connected .... <this is what you want> 
 2) Remote Procedure Error  11 b6 
 3) Remote Procedure Error  11 e2 
 4) Not Reachable  05 e6 
 5) not reachable  05 db 
 6) Not operating ....  <try later> 
 7) illegal address  03 80 
 8) Busy  01 00 ..... <try later> 
 9) enhanced network services unavalible at this time please try again 05 d8 
10) illegal address  03 ba 
11) rejecting        00 7e 
12) illegal address  03 42 
13) remote procedure error  11 31 
14) Refused collect connection 19 00 ..... <use NUI> 
15) not reachable  05 ed 
16) not responding 0d f0 
 
 
 
 if the call is connected you will find an interesting computer system, or  
 whatever.. 
 
 
 What is an NUI and how do you use it.. 
 --------------------------------------- 
 
 An NUI or Network User Id is mostly used for connecting to things that give  
 you the "Refused collect connection" error. I always have an NUI in use when 
 I am scanning 
 
 at the @ promt type: 
 
 @ ID USERID  
   
 it will come up with a  
   PASS= promt, so then  you enter the password I have a listing of about 80 
 or so NUI's and they usually dont die , so here is a few.... 
 
 ID  SIMPCNOE    
 PASS= 071034 
 
 ID FINLAY 
 PASS= 004461
