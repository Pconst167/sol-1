		    When bit4 of 40h:89h is 0, VGA emulates 350-line EGA if

			0 1  400-line mode at next mode set
			1 0  200-line mode requested
			1 1  reserved
			Apparently VGA BIOS mode set disregards bit 7 and uses
			byte 40h:88h to determine 200/350 selection when bit 4
			is zero. Presumably bit 7 is a convenience for other
			purposes. Bit 7 is reset to zero after the mode set.

				   =0 emulate CGA, digital monitor, 200 lines,
					  8 x 8 text font at next mode set
				      Bit unchanged by mode set.
		    bit 3:  =0 if default palette loading enabled at mode set
		    bit 2:  =1 if mono display, =0 if color display
		    bit 1:  =1 if gray scale summing enabled, =0 if disabled
		    bit 0:  [VGA] =1 if VGA active, =0 if not
			    [MCGA] reserved, zero
		Note: the Tseng ET4000 BIOS v3.00 uses bits 6-4 of 88h and
			bits 6-5 of 89h to specify graphics-mode refresh
			rates as follows
				88h/6		640x480:  1 for 72Hz,0 for 60Hz
