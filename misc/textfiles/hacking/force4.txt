The following is a listing of NUA's I came across just recently on Austpac and
most of them do not appear on any other listings.  At the time I didn't have a
NUI, so a lot of them are not identified.

When you get a RNA error, it means you need a NUI to access the system.
If accessing via another PAD just use the proper format as explained earlier.
I'm working on a complete list of a Austpac NUA's along with MIDAS ones, but
that will take some time.

L O C A T I N G    P T S N   N U M B E R S
-------------------------------------------

If you ever have a need to locate an online system belonging to a particular
company, it can be a very tall order to fill.  However there are few things you
can do which will help, although success is not guaranteed.

1>   When a Company sets up a data line, It must be registered by telecom to
     be legal. (Isn't it great to have a friends working there ey?)  All data
     lines are classed a FAX lines, and unless telecom has been specifically
     instructed not to list the number in any public listing, you will most
     probably find it listed in the FAX DIRECTORY, which is available from
     Telecom.  It's an equivalent of a phone book with only data lines listed.
     So, just grab a copy of the directory and look up the company. Chances
     are that it might be there.   One can even find BBS systems in there if
     they have been registered by the Sysop.

2>   When a company sets up their phone network, they usually plan ahead and
     a lot of times when they get voice and data lines assigned, they will
     be very close together in value.  So, simply look up the victims voice
     line and try a few numbers lower and higher than the voice number.
     Again there is a chance of comming up with something.

3>   The last resort, is scanning phone numbers in series for a carrier tone.
     It can take a lot of time, and be very expensive, since we just can't
     use the same hardware to make toll free calls like they do in the USA.
     There is a feasable way of doing though. A lot of systems will answer
     after the first few dial tones, so set your demon dialer program to
     dial a number, sit there for only a few ring tones and hang up. The
     longer you let it ring, the more accurate it will be, but more costly,
     if people have enough time to pick up the phone. If you let it ring
     about 3-4 times and you have your scanner going at 4am, you should have
     very few problems, either with accuracy and finance.  There are some
     fancy alternatives like tapping another line, using a phone box etc,
     but they are too messy.

OBTAINING PASSWORDS, INFOLTRATING SYSTEMS
------------------------------------------

There are a few methods available which you can use to get into systems.

1>   The most common and by far the least successful in regards to the
     amount of time waisted is the ole front line security warfare.
     It basicaly means physically trying to guess a username/password
     pair for the system trying random, but logical combinations, or using
     prior knowledge of the system, ie DEFAULT ACCOUNTS, USERNAME STRUCTURES
     etc.  A Sophisticated Sprinter can be a great aid, but it's a good idea
     to have some prior knowldge of username formats. A system that will
     actually tell you that a username is invalid, before you enter a password,
     is as good as hacked.    Some PRIMENETS, VM/370's and TOPS-20 systems are
     about the best examples.

2>   Many systems, particularly new ones, tend to have weak points in their
     front line security which you can use to gain access..
     Here is a small list which I have found, but there are many more.

        -  TOPS-20 Systems have a FINGER command before login, which can be
           used to examine files, mail etc, without the knowldege of a
           Password. They also have a SYSTAT command which lists the online
           users which can be used before you login. A lot of them have now
           been changed and the FINGER command removed, but still there are
           a few out there.

        -  PRIMENETS,  These had a few weak points in the early versions, but
           a lot of them are now non-existent, if they are running later
           versions of PRIMOS. It's still a good idea to know about them,
           because I have found few systems which have not been updated.
           Ok, when you are prompted for a password on the old primos, and you
           have a legitimate username, typing CTRL-C for password, can give you
           access. Another weak point of most Primenets, are the Default
           accounts, mainly TEST, which often have no need for
           a password. To crash the system from captive mode into primos,
           CTRL-P pressed several times will often do the job.  CTRL-P when
           pressed in the right spot will crash into Primos.  You will have to
           spend a lot of time finding the right spot, but every primenet I
           came across was crashable.  I don't usually give this out, but
           concentrate on the captive communication module.

        -  UNIX's  have got so many holes in them that it's really not funny,
           but to make use of them, one needs to get inside first and there
           are dozens of defaults to choose from. More about that later.


3>   SOCIAL ENGINEERING.   Yes, my favourite one.  The term has originated
     in the USA and means BULLSHITING PEOPLE to get them to hand over their
     passwords quite willingly.  If one is to attempt this art, one needs the
     tools. These are mainly an ADULT voice, since a teenager will get
     nowhere, and the ability to plan out the conversation and anticipate
     every responce. Let me give you a few examples:
     You all know that AUSTPAC NUI's a hard to get, so why not have some dumb
     secretary give one to you. Firs of all find a victim. The Melbourne
     University Library is a good one. Next get a few facts together. Ask
     yourself a few questions.  Who am I?  'An Assistant Austpac Operator' Pick
     a real name from the phone book, jot down the number, address and
     have it ready if needed.  Why Should the Victim give you his Accounts?
     'Basically, because there has been a stuff up with Austpac and the last
     six digits have been lost and you need them to identify the user' just
     talk about some technical bullshit about the structure of NUI's, how the
     billing computer stuffed up and how your arse is going to get kicked.
     Its a good idea to ask the person to come down to the main office.
    (you know all the details, and so you must). Then suggest the
     possibility of fixing it all up over the phone. If it's a jerk, you'll
     get it on the spot, if not, give him a number to call back. Ie a PHONE
     BOX around the corner. And that's all there is to it.   You will be
     surprised how co-operative people are.
     The same principal can also be used in few other situations. There is no
     reason why a system operator can't change the password of another
     user for you. This was basically my introduction to the art of SOCIAL
     ENGINEERING and this is what took place:

     I hacked a Dialcom System 41, which me and a lot of YANKS were using to
     call ALTOS and other systems. Unfortunatelly, it died for reasons I am
     still emebarrased about. This is what we did.
     I knew that the real user wasn't on the account all that often, so she
     would have not yet known about the death of her account.  Fortunatelly,
     we had a hard copy of the user list in her UFD series and of her mail.
     (I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF RECORDING EVERY
     BIT OF DATA YOU GET FROM A SYSTEM.  IT'S ALWAYS USEFULL AT SOME STAGE IN
     THE FUTURE.  IF ONE IS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A HARD DISK, SIMPLY SAVE
     ABSOLUTELLY EVERYTHING YOU DO ONLINE, BUT TAKE SOME PRECAUTIONS FOR
     OBVIOUS REASONS)
     The first step was to find her details. Ie Address, Phone number, and
     Christian NAME.  We rang up the operator to give us a listing of all
     AUGUSTINES in the aproximate area as deduced from the mail. There were
     only a few so we went through them. No luck, she had an unlisted number.
     Ok, so we called a CNA (CNA is like a information directory, but used by
     the phone companies emploees only. CNA = Customer Number/Address I think.
     Unfortunatelly I never came across an Australian CNA, but you can bet
     they're out there), but the number had been changed, so we rang up a
     friend who was mentioned in the mail.  MRS  M.AUGUSTINE worked for NASA
     so TRADER introduced himself as some important figure in the NASA
     organization and we got all the details we wanted. All we had to do then
     is ring up DIALCOM and get them to change the password. We said that
     the wife was in GERMANY using DATEX-P and that she can't get onto
     her account, where some important mail was waiting for her.  Naturally
     the password was changed on the spot and no information of any sort
     was requested.

4>   Trojan Horses are another way of getting passwords.  It basically
     involves the simulation of another system login and setting up a few users
     to take the bait. Ie, Stick your computer onto a phone box at a time a
     person is likely to call, give that person the number. Ie it has been
     changed or it's a different system with faster responces thus saving
     online time etc. Then have your computer to simulate the real login and
     that's all there is to it. This is a very primitive trojan and I will talk
     more about them later on and tell you how to set up a few of them on
     DIALCOM systems.

A Most Important thing is to make sure that once you get into a system, you
are there to stay, or the effort would have been more or less waisted. Always
get all the information you can. Mail, Usernames and any information on the
other users. Basically anything the system has to offer, no matter how
insignificant it may Seem at the time.


DEFFAUL PASSWORDS, VAX, UNIX, PRIMENET, DIALCOM
------------------------------------------------

There is a large variety of systems, but a lot of them have got common
accounts.  It is always a good idea to try hacking usernames such as
TEST, DEMO, GUEST, VISITOR etc, using the most basic and easilly remembered
passwords you can think off.  Deffault accounts are very usefull indeed
and here is a basic rundown of a few major systems:

VAX
----

When you encounter a VAX, trying the following may prove quite successfull.

USER/USER, GUEST/GUEST, GAST/GAST (if in europe), FIELD/SERVICE, FIELD/TEST,
SYSTEM/MANAGER, SYSTEM/OPERATOR, SYSTEM/SYSTEM, SYSTEST/TEST, SYSTEST/SYSTEST
SYSTEST/UETP.

Also try them in lower as well as upper case, if the system does not
translate lower to upper case.  If you are lucky enough to get an account
with full privs, namelly SYSTEM/MANAGER, or FIELD/SERVICE, look at some of
the user names, ie  SHOW USERS command, and create your own username of a
simmilar format so that it blends in with the backround. To do that, run the
ADDUSER or AUTHORISE program in the SYS$SYSTEM directory, I don't think I
need to go into any more detail since there are literally hundereds of good
files on VAX systems.
If you come accross a captive account, ie you are not allowed direct access
into DCL (Digital Command Language), typing /NOCOMM can prevent the execution
of certain login files which may prevent you from accessing DCL or lower your
access level.   Example Login:

Username: USER/NOCOMM
Password: USER

$

There is one other important thing about VAX's that is not mentioned in any
VAX tutorials I have seen. Some systems are equiped with a X29 gateway or
PSIPAD as they refer to it. It's basically what the name suggest, a gateway
to PACKET SWITCHED NETWORKS.

To activate it, type:

$ SET HOST/X29

And the system should respond with 'Node:'  You will then find out if the
PSIPAD is installed and whether you have the privs to make use of it.

END
END
