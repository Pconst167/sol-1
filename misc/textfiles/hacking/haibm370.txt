Preface
^^^^^^^

This file represents and shows you how to gain access of the neighborhood
IBM VM/370 Mainframe with tricks and tips it could save you hours of HELP
file access in a few easy to learn lines.


First
Connection to a IBM VM/370 is easy!!. After connection (by modem or
terminal in half duplex if acceptable) type:


(C/R) B
or
PB
or
SP

if it is a VM/370
it should come back with:

VM/370 online


then hit (C/R) or Space Bar
a dot (.) should appear.  This is the
main command prompt.

.
now
you must logon

Format:
.LOG (id) (password)
or
.LOG (id)

ex:
.LOG OPERATOR SYSTEM
or
.LOG OPERATOR
ENTER PASSWORD
SYSTEM

Valid VM accounts built into the machine by IBM are:

OPERATOR     (for Operator status!)
VMBACKUP     (memory backup account)
PVM
BATCH1

Operator status IS available via the dial-up with NO restrictions!! after
entering  your account (ID) the password can only be 8 characters maximum
then you are in.

Once on you are in CMS status you should remain in CMS status to gain full
appreciation of  the IBM system.To check to see what status you are in hit
(C/R) alone after the dot (.)

Ex:

.CMS
.

or

.CP
.

etc...

(Please note: CMS=Conversational Monitoring System)

and

(CP=Control Program. You don't want to be in this state type BEGIN)


if for some reason you witness a abnormal logon type

BEGIN

it will then reset your account and put you back into the normal mode of the
machine

(Note: all instructions are meant to be executed only in the CMS environment)

Q NAMES

lists useraccounts presently logged on

Q ALL

lists what/who owns the account memory etc..

LISTFILE

lists the current directory of the account

TYPE (filename)

Executes a CMS file similar to EXEC command.

for a help file listing type

HELP CMS

and

LOGOFF

logs you off the VM system


Here is a small list of VM systems
to experiment with:

That's all dudes and hack on!
