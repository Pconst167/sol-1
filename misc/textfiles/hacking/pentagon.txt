        Into:
        -----
 First of all Milnet is a system used by the Air Force and the Pentagon for
communication use. You know you are on milnet when you see that infamous 
TAC login xxx. Milnet is run out of the University of Southern California,
(this might give some of you some ideas who live around there).
        Logon Info
       ------------
 The Milnet number is 1-800-368-2217.
 The ISI MASTER DIAL UP IS 213-306-1366.
This is a more tricky logon procedure but if you got balls, you're using a
trunk box, or you are just S-T-U-P-I-D here goes:
ISIE MASTER LOGON PROCEEDURE
----------------------------
1> call 213-306-1366
2> when the phone stops ringing you are connected
3> enter location number (9 digits) + 1 or 0
4> hang up and it will call you
5> pick up the phone and hit the '*' on your phone
6> hit a carriage return on the computer
7> at the 'what class?' prompt hit RETURN!!!
8> then a 'go' prompt will appear and log on as you would the 800 number.
MILNET LOGIN PROCEEDURE
-----------------------
If you have trouble connecting try 300 bauds instead of 1200. It's a bite in
the ass but, sometime the connection will fuck up if you don't.
 When you first connect you will see:
'WELCOME TO DDN. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.TAC LOGIN
CALL NIC 1-800-235-3155 FOR HELP
WRPAT TAC 113 #:36
(you type)
@o 1/103
 YOU ALWAYS TYPE @o then other connections are:
                          ISIA             3/103
                          ISIB          10:3/52
                          ISID          10:0/27
                          ISIE             1/103    (THE EXAMPLE)
                          ISIF             2/103
                          VAX A         10:2/27
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Next you will see a 'USER-ID' promt. The first 4 characters vary but it is
is always followed by a '-' and what ever connection you choose.
User-Id:   (example)  CER5-ISIE or MRW1-ISIE
 The first three letters are the initials of the user followed by a random
number (1-9).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Access Code: (example) 2285UNG6A or 22L8KK5CH
 An access code will never contain a ( 1, 0, G, Z).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ USERNAME + PASSWORD        IE USERNAME SAC.305AREFW-LGTO
        THE USERNAME EXPLANATION:
        The first 3 letters will be SAC. This stands for Strategic Air
Command.
Followint that is a '.' Then the squadron number and the prime mission.
In this case '305AREFW', (305TH AIR REFULING WING). Then a '-' and the
Individual Squadron name 'LGTO' (LOGISTICS GROUND TRANSPORATION OPERATIONS),
a fancey name for the motor pool. I'll try and get a list of these there are
tons of names. 
        The password will not be echoed back and should be entered after a
the username.
        The new user password as a default is: NEW-UZER-ACNT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
