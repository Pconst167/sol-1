<H1>Hacking Textfiles: Conventions</H1>
<P>
It was always natural for people who used a BBS who were all located nearby to have
gatherings and parties. In some cases, people might travel a long distance to see the
faces behind the text. There was nothing better than hanging out for a while with the
folks you'd talked to for months, having some great times and eating some pizza or
drinking soda while the hours went on. 
<P>
You can trace back the idea of "conventions" a long way back; there have been science
fiction conventions, computer conventions, even phone phreak conventions... why
not hacker conventions? Some started out small and have grown to thousands of attendees,
with rented hotels and huge events accompanying them. Others are small and will remain
so, the same small group of friends meeting regularly to share stories and get insanely,
blindly drunk. 
<P>
Here are some of the textfiles that have accompanied these events.
