   One day, while raiding my parents attic, I came across some old books 
we had enjoyed as children.  "YOUNG'S DEMONSTRATIVE TRANSLATION OF 
SCIENTIFIC SECRETS" being one of them.  Everyone liked to look through the 
old book to see the way things were done over one hundred and twenty five 
years ago.
  The problem, of course, was that the combination of age and frequent 
handling were having a disastrous effect on the book's physical condition. 
The solution was to copy the book so we could enjoy what it contained 
without further damage to the original.
   During the summer of 1987 my nephew (Bob Gravonic) and I copied it on 
to my computer.  It's been done as faithfully as possible.  Obscure items 
have been copied exactly as printed and many of the  spellings which you 
may attribute to copy mistakes are as they were originally printed.
   While every effort has been made to ensure that what you now have is an 
exact copy of the original text, we make no guarantees to this end.  We 
definitely do not encourage the use of the remedies or medicines listed in 
the text for various ailments and diseases.
   Some of the ingredients called for in many of the receipts may leave 
you puzzled.  Join the club.  We don't know where to find "two scruples of 
calomel" (No. 344) either.  And we're sure the SPCA would have something 
to say about pouring fresh melted butter in a horse's ears (No. 321).
   My own favorite is number 509, the GOOD SAMARITAN PAIN KILLER which 
begins with two quarts of 95% alcohol and one ounce of the oil of 
turpentine.
   Our family has had much enjoyment from this curious old book.  We hope 
you do to.

The object of the present work is clearly announced in its title. It is to 
collect within a small compass the instructions of experimental knowledge 
upon a great variety of subjects which relate to the present interests of 
man. It contains above five hundred genuine and practical receipts, which 
have been compiled by the publisher with extreme difficulty and expense. A 
reference to the list of subjects which the work contains, will show that 
the publisher's researches have been extensive, while a comparison of the 
work with others of the same general character evinces patient labour, and 
cannot fail to give it pre-eminence. While the track pursued is not new, 
it is more thorough, and more easily followed than that marked out by any 
previous compiler known to myself. The work contains not merely the 
outlines on the subjects to which it refers, but, what appears to my own 
mind one of its excellences, the full and clear explanations of these 
subjects. To all classes of people, without exception, the work is of 
great value. It is fit, on every account, that the publisher should be 
encouraged in this production. The work is worthy the acceptance of all, 
and one which every man may prize.

                           1. ORIENTAL PAINTING
Any bunch of roses or flowers, or any thing of the kind that you admire, 
take the pattern of by placing them against a light of window glass, then 
lay a piece of white paper over them, and through the latter you will see 
the roses, &c. Now with a lead pencil take the pattern of the roses, &c., 
on the paper; when you have them all marked, cut then out with a scissors, 
so that you have a complete pattern of them. Now take a piece of glass, 
whatever size your pattern requires, stick the pattern on it with wafers, 
then paint the glass all over, except where the pattern covers, with black 
paint, composed of refined lampblack, black enamel, copel varnish and 
turpentine, mixed. Now let this dry, then take off your patterns and paint 
your roses, flowers, &c., with tube paints, mixed with demar varnish, so 
that your roses, &c., may be, in a manner, transparent. Paint your large 
roses red, some of the smaller ones yellow, or any colour to suit your 
taste. Paint one side of the leaves a darker shade of green than the 
other, which will make the picture appear as though the sun was shining on 
it. When this painting is dry, take silver or gold foil, (gold is best,) 
wrinkle it up in your hand then nearly straighten it, and cover the back 
of the glass all over with it; over the large roses let the wrinkles be 
larger, over the small ones smaller, &c.; then lay a piece of stiff paper, 
the size of the glass, over the foil, and a piece of very thin board again 
over this; have it framed in this manner and it is completed. You now have 
one of the richest of paintings, which is commonly taught at a cost of $5. 
You may buy all you require for this painting at the druggist's.

                       2. TRANSFER PAINTING ON GLASS
This is for transferring any picture plate you please to glass, to be 
framed. First give the glass a coat of demar varnish; let it remain for 
eight hours, or until dry; at this time have your picture thoroughly 
soaked in warm water; then give the glass another coat of demar varnish, 
and take the picture out of the water; then let it and the glass remain 
for twenty minutes, by which time the water will be struck in from the 
face of the picture, after which you will place the front of the picture 
on the varnished glass, (avoiding wrinkles and spots of water,) press it 
well on until every part is stuck fast, then carefully rub the paper all 
away to a mere film; give the glass then, over this film, another coat of 
demar varnish, which will make the film transparent; let it dry; then 
place the glass, with the varnished side towards you, between you and the 
light, and you will see the outlines of the picture quite distinctly; you 
may then paint on the back with tube paints, mixed with a little demar 
varnish to assist in drying, to suit your taste. For instance, if the 
picture is that of a lady, you may paint the dress red, the shawl or cape, 
as it may be, blue, the face flesh colour, (which colour may be made by 
mixing a little red with white,) the bonnet scarlet, the shoes black; if 
trees, have them green, &c. All you want for this painting you may also 
buy at the druggist's. This painting is very simple and elegant, it is 
commonly taught at a cost of $3. Try it, you cannot fail.

                            3. TRANSFER VARNISH
Take of Canada balsam 3 drachms; gum sandric 3 drachms; spirits of wine 
1/2 pint. Dissolve the balsam and gum in the spirits of wine and it is 
ready for use.













                 4. WHITE SPIRIT VARNISH - THE VERY BEST.
Take of gum sandrack 4 ounces; mastic 1 ounce; Elmi rosin 1/2 ounce; 
Venice turpentine 1 ounce; alcohol 15 ounces. Digest in a bottle, 
frequently shaking, till the gums are dissolved, and it is ready for use.

                       5. TRANSFER PAINTING ON WOOD
By this you may transfer any picture you please from paper to a cutter 
back, or any other substance you please. Give the board three coats of 
white spirit varnish, receipt No.4; damp the back of the print with strong 
vinegar; give the front a very heavy coat of the transfer varnish, receipt 
No.3; then press it on the board, avoiding creases; when perfectly dry and 
fast, rub the paper away; the print is indelibly fixed; then varnish it 
over as you would any other painting. This receipt has been commonly sold 
for $5.

6. ELECTRO GOLD PLATING - NEW METHOD
Take 100 grams of laminated gold, mixed with 20 grams of hydrochloric 
acid; 10 grams of nitric acid; the liquid thus composed is placed over a 
moderate fire, and stirred constantly until the gold passes into the state 
of chlorine; it is then allowed to cool. A second liquid is formed by 
dissolving 60 grams of cyanide of potassium in 80 grams of distilled 
waters; the two liquids are mixed together in a decanter and stirred for 
20 minutes, and then filtered. Finally 100 grams of whiting, dry and 
sifted, are mixed with 5 grams of pulverised supertartrate of potass; this 
new powder is dissolved in a portion of the above described liquid, in 
sufficient quantity to form a paste of the proper consistency to be spread 
with a pencil on the article or part to be gilded. The superabundant 
powder is then removed by washing and the article is beautifully gilded 
with a heavy or light coat, according to the quantity of paste used. Grams 
belong to French weights, four grams are a little more than one drachm.

ELECTRO SILVERING - NEW METHOD
10 grams of nitrate of silver are dissolved in 50 grams of distilled 
water; then 25 grams of cyanide of potassium in 50 grams of distilled 
water; the two liquids are mixed in a decanter, and stirred for 10 
minutes; it is then filtered. Finally, 100 grams of sifted whiting are 
mixed with 10 grams of pulverised supertartrate of potass and one gram of 
mercury. This powder and dissolving liquid are used in the same manner as 
in the above method of gold plating. These excellent methods of silvering 
and gilding were discovered in June 1860, by the great French chemist 
Baldooshong of Paris France. It is far superior to any other method ever 
discovered, and will eventually take the place of all.






8. ELECTRO GOLD PLATING - USUAL METHOD
Take a $2 50c. piece of gold, and put it into a mixture of 1 ounce of 
nitric and 4 ounces of muriatic acids, (glass vessels only are to be used 
in this work,) when it is all cut dissolve 1/2 an ounce of sulphate of 
potash in one pint of pure rain water, and mix the gold solution, stirring 
well; then let stand and the gold will be thrown down; then pour off the 
acid fluid, and wash the gold in two or three waters, or until no acid is 
tasted by touching the tongue to the gold. Now dissolve one ounce of 
cyanuret of potassium in one pint of pure rain water, to which add the 
gold, and it is ready to use. Clear the article to be plated from all dirt 
and grease with whiting and a good brush; if there are cracks it may be 
necessary to put the article in a solution of caustic potash. At all 
events every particle of dirt and grease must be removed; then suspend the 
article in the cyanuret of gold solution, with a small strip of zinc cut 
about the width of a common knitting needle, hooking the top over a stick 
which will reach across the top of the vessel or bottle holding the 
solution. If the zinc is too large the deposit will be made so fast that 
it will scale off. The slower the plating goes on the better, and this is 
arranged by the size if the zinc used. When not using the plating fluid 
keep it well corked and it is always ready to use, bearing in mind that it 
is poison as arsenic, and must be put high out of the way of children, and 
labelled poison, although you need have no fear using it; yet accidents 
might arise it its nature were not known.

9. ELECTRO SILVERING - USUAL METHOD
This is done every way the same as gold plating (using coin) except that 
rock salt is used instead of the cyanuret of potassium to hold the silver 
in solution for use, and when it is of the proper strength of salt it has 
a thick curdy appearance, or you can add salt until the silver will 
deposit on the article to be plated, which is all that is required. No 
hesitation need be felt in trying these receipts, as they are obtained 
from a genuine source, and are in every day use.

                          10. GOLD PLATING FLUID
Warm six ounces of pure rain water, and dissolve in it 2 ounces of cyanide 
of potassium, then add a 1/4 ounce oxide of gold; the solution will at 
first be yellowish, but will soon subside to white; then half fill a 
bottle with whiting, fill it up with this solution and shake it well; you 
may now take a piece of old cotton, wet it with the solution, rub it well 
over brass, copper, &c., and it is nicely washed with gold.

                         11. SILVER PLATING FLUID
Dissolve one ounce of nitrate of silver, in crystal, in 12 ounces of soft 
water; then dissolve in the water two ounces of cyanuret of potash; shake 
the whole together and let it stand until it becomes clear. Have ready 
some 1/2 ounce vials, and fill them half full of whiting, then fill up the 
bottles and it is ready for use. The whiting does not increase the coating 
powder - it only helps to clear the articles and save the silver fluid by 
half filling the bottles. The above quantity of materials will cost about 
$1.62c., so that the fluid will be about 3 cents a bottle. It is used in 
the same way as the gold plating fluid.









                       12. QUICKSILVER PLATING FLUID
Take of quicksilver one ounce, one ounce nitric acid, one ten cent piece, 
rain water 1/2 pint to a pint, put the three first articles into a tumbler 
together; let them stand until dissolved, occasionally stirring, then add 
the water, and it is ready for use. This is used in the same way as the 
silver and gold plating fluid.

                             13. TO GILD STEEL
Pour some of the ethereal solution of gold into a wine-glass, and dip into 
it the blade of a new penknife, lancet, razor, &c., withdraw the 
instrument and allow the ether to evaporate, the blade will then be found 
to be covered with a beautiful coat of gold; the blade may be moistened 
with a clean rag or a small piece of very dry sponge dipped into the 
ether, and the same effect will be produced.

              14. TO GILD COPPER, BRASS, &c. - BY AN AMALGAM
The gilding of these inferior metals and alloys of them is effected by the 
assistance of mercury with which the gold is amalgamated. The mercury is 
evaporated while the gold is fixed by the application of heat, the whole 
is then burnished of left mat in the whole or in part, according as 
required.

                      15. GILDING GLASS AND PORCELAIN
Dissolve in boiling linseed oil an equal weight either of copal or amber, 
and add as much oil of turpentine as will enable you to apply the compound 
or size thus formed as thin as possible to the parts of the glass intended 
to be gilt; the glass is to be placed in a stove till it is so warm as 
almost to burn the fingers when handled. At this temperature the size 
becomes adhesive, and a piece of leaf gold applied in the usual way will 
immediately stick. Sweep off the superfluous portions of the leaf, and 
when quite cold it may be burnished, taking care to interpose a piece of 
india paper between the gold and the burnisher. It sometimes happens when 
the varnish is not very good that by repeated washing the gold wears off; 
on this account the practice of burning it in is sometimes had recourse 
to; for this purpose some gold powder is ground with borax, and in this 
state applied to the clean surface of the glass by a camel hair pencil; 
when quite dry the glass is put into a stove, heated to about the 
temperature of an annealing oven, the gum burns off; and the borax, by 
vitrifying, cements the gold with great firmness to the glass, after which 
it may be burnished.
The gilding upon porcelain is in like manner fixed by heat and the use of 
borax, and this kind of ware, being neither transparent nor liable to 
soften, and thus to be injured in its form in a low red heat, is free from 
the risk and injury which the finer and more fusible kinds of glass are 
apt to sustain from such treatment. Porcelain and other wares may be 
platinized, silvered, tinned, or bronzed, in a similar manner.









                      16. GILDING THE EDGES OF PAPER
The edges of the leaves of books and letter paper are gilded whilst in a 
horizontal position in the bookbinder's press or some arrangement of the 
same nature, by first applying a composition formed of four parts of 
Armenian-bole and one of candied sugar, ground together with water to a 
proper consistence, and laid on by a brush with the white of an egg. This 
coating, when nearly dry is smoothed be the burnisher, it is then slightly 
moistened by a sponge dipped in clean water and squeezed in the hand; the 
gold leaf is now taken up on a piece of cotton from the leathern cushion 
and applied on the moistened surface; when dry it is to be burnished by 
rubbing the burnisher over it repeatedly from end to end, taking care not 
to wound the surface by the point.

                17. PROFESSOR WORTS' AMALGAM FOR SILVERING
This is the only means yet discovered for silvering iron directly, yet it 
is not so lasting as some of the other processes. Take quicksilver and the 
metal potassium, equal parts by volume, put them together in a tumbler, 
and if both metals be good there will be a brisk ebullition, which 
continues until an amalgam of the two is formed, then add as much 
quicksilver as there is of the amalgam; let it work till thoroughly mixed, 
and it is ready for use. This amalgam you may apply with a cloth to any 
metal, even iron, though it be a rusty bar, and you have it neatly 
silvered over.

18. FOR COPPERING IRON
This is the latest method, and that now in use. To a solution of sulphate 
of copper, add a solution of ferrocyanide of pottasium, so long as a 
precipitate continues to be formed. This is allowed to settle, and the 
clear liquor being decanted the vessel is filled with water, and when the 
precipitate settles the liquor is again decanted, and continue to repeat 
these washings until the sulphate of potash is washed quite out; this is 
known by adding a little chloride of barium to a small quantity of the 
washings, and when there is no white precipitate formed by the test, the 
precipitate is sufficiently washed. A solution of cyanide of potassium is 
now added to this precipitate until it is dissolved, during which process 
the solution becomes warm by the chemical re-action which takes place. The 
solution is filtered, and allowed to repose all night. If the solution of 
cyanide of potassium that is used is strong, the greater portion of the 
ferrocyanide of potassium crystalises in the solution, and may be 
collected and preserved for use again. If the solution of cyanide of 
potassium used to dissolve the precipitate is dilute, it will be necessary 
to condense the liquor by evaporation to obtain the yellow prussiate in 
crystals. The remaining solution is the coppering solution; should it not 
be convenient to separate the yellow prussiate by crystallization, the 
presence of that salt in the solution does not deteriorate it nor 
interfere with its power of depositing copper.






          19. PECULIARITIES IN WORKING CYANIDE OF COPPER SOLUTION
The true composition of the salts thus formed by copper and cyanide of 
potassium has not yet been determined, but their relations to the battery 
and electrolyzation are peculiar. The solution must be worked at a heat 
not less than from 150~ to 200~ Farenheit (that is not quite as hot a 
boiling water, which is 212~ Farenheit.) All other solutions we have tried 
follow the laws, that if the electricity is so strong as to cause gas to 
be evolved at the electrode, the metal will be deposited in a sandy or 
powdered state, but the solution of cyanide of copper and potassium is an 
exception to these laws, as there is no reguline deposit obtained unless 
gas is freely evolved from the surface of the article upon which the 
deposit is taking place. As this solution is used hot, a considerable 
evaporation takes place, which requires that additions be made to the 
solution from time to time. If water alone be used for this purpose it 
will precipitate a great quantity of the copper as a white powder, but 
this is prevented by dissolving a little cyanide of potassium in the water 
at the rate of 4 ounces to the gallon. The vessels used in factories for 
this solution are generally of copper, which are heated over a flue or in 
a sand-bath, the vessel itself serving as the positive electrode of the 
battery; but any vessel will suit if a copper electrode is employed when 
the vessel is not of copper.

              20. PREPARATION OF IRON FOR COATING WITH COPPER
When it is required to cover an iron article with copper, it is first 
steeped in hot caustic potash or soda to remove any grease or oil. Being 
washed from that it is placed for a short time in diluted sulphuric acid, 
consisting of about one part acid to 16 parts of water, which removes any 
oxide that may exist. It is then washed in water and scoured with sand 
till the surface is perfectly clean, and finally attached to the battery 
and immersed in the cyanide solution. All this must be done with despatch 
so as to prevent the iron combining with oxygen. An immersion of five 
minutes duration in the cyanide solution is sufficient to deposit upon the 
iron a film of copper, but it is necessary to the complete protection of 
the iron that it should have a considerably thick coating, and as the 
cyanide process is expensive, it is preferable when the iron has received 
a film of copper by the cyanide solution, to take it out, wash it in 
water, and attach to it a simple cell or weak battery, and put it into a 
solution of sulphate of copper. If there is any part not sufficiently 
covered with copper by the cyanide solution, the sulphate will make these 
parts of a dark colour, which a touch of the finger will remove. When such 
is the case, the article must be taken out, scoured, and put again into 
the cyanide solution till perfectly covered. A little practice will render 
this very easy. The sulphate solution for covering iron should be prepared 
by adding it by degrees a little caustic potash, so long as the 
precipitate formed is re-dissolved. This neutralizes a great portion of 
the sulphuric acid, and thus the iron is not so readily acted upon. When 
the iron is thus coppered, proceed to silver it in the manner recommended 
for silvering according to receipt No.9; or if you want to put a very 
heavy coating of silver on it, make use of a strong battery.









                            21. SOLDERING FLUID
For mending articles of tin, iron, zinc, copper, and almost all other 
metals. Take 2 fl. ounces of muriatic acid, add zinc till bubbles cease to 
rise, add 1/2 a teaspoonful of sal ammoniac and 2 ounces of water. Damp 
the part you wish to solder with this fluid, lay on a small piece of lead, 
and with a piece of hot iron or soldering iron solder the part.

                            22. SOLDER FOR TIN
Take of pewter 4 parts, tin 1 part, bismuth 1 part; melt them together. 
Resin is used with this solder.

23. COLD METHOD OF SILVERING IRON WITH SILVER-PLATE
Polish the iron toy wish to silver, then damp it over with soldering fluid 
(receipt No.21) When this is done give it a coat of No.22 solder. This is 
done by laying a piece of cold solder on the iron, and spreading it over 
with a heated soldering iron, when by this means you get the iron nicely 
plated with solder, then lay on your silver-plate evenly, and gently rub 
it over with the heated soldering iron, and it will become firmly united 
with the solder as the solder is with the iron, so that you have the iron 
beautifully plated with silver with very little cost or trouble.

24. HOT METHOD OF SILVERING IRON WITH SILVER-PLATE
First polish the iron you wish to silver, wet it well over with No.21 
soldering fluid; then having procured that kind of silver-plate which is 
tin on one side and silver on the other, place it evenly on, with the 
tined side next to the iron, then place it on the fire until the 
silver-plate melts down, then at once take it from the fire, and it will 
be firmly attached to the iron, and will be excellent plate; yet No.23, 
the cold method, is to be preferred in most cases.

25. SILVERING LOOKING-GLASSES WITH QUICKSILVER
Take a piece of marble or some other substance very smooth, true, and 
level, lay on this the glass you wish to silver, then make a ridge of 
putty on the marble against the edge of the glass all round it, so that 
you can pour quicksilver on the glass until it is all covered over, and 
will be prevented from running off by the ridge of putty; an inch or two, 
or three outside this ridge make another of putty; then cover the 
quicksilver on the glass all over with tin-foil, and press it firmly but 
cautiously against the glass until you have squeezed out all the 
quicksilver you can. while you press this you may remove part of the first 
ridge of putty to give the quicksilver a chance of escape. When it is well 
pressed against the glass there will be an amalgam formed of the tin-foil 
and the quicksilver that is left, which will firmly adhere to the glass. 
By this means you have a very beautiful and cheap looking-glass; the 
quicksilver that escapes, being saved by the second ridge of putty, may be 
used again.






26. SILVERING LOOKING-GLASSES WITH PURE SILVER
Prepare a mixture of 3 grains of ammonia, 60 grains of nitrate of silver, 
90 minims of spirits of wine, 90 minims of water; when the nitrate of 
silver is dissolved, filter the liquid and add a small quantity of sugar 
(15 grains) dissolved in 1 1/2 oz. of water, and 1 1/2 oz. of spirits of 
wine. Put the glass into this mixture, having one side covered with 
varnish, gum, or some substance to prevent the silver being attached to 
it. Let it remain for a few days and you have a most elegant 
looking-glass, yet it is far more costly than the quicksilver.

                         27. PATENT BURNING FLUID
To 1 gallon of 95 per cent. alcohol, add 1 quart of camphene oil; mix and 
shake well, and if transparent it is fit for use, if not, add sufficient 
alcohol, shaking it well, to bring it to the natural colour of the 
alcohol. It may be coloured to suit the fancy by adding a little tincture 
of golden seal, or any other colouring drug. This receipt has been sold 
for $10.

                             28. BURNING FLUID
Take 4 quarts alcohol, and 1 quart spirits of turpentine; mix well 
together, and it is ready for use.

29. NON-EXPLOSIVE BURNING FLUID
Take 1 gallon 44 proof alcohol, 1 quart camphene, 3 oz. of alum 
pulverized, 1/2 oz. camphor gum, 65 drops cuicuma; mix all together and 
let it stand 12 hours, and it is ready for use.

                  30. VINEGAR IN THREE DAYS WITHOUT DRUGS
Take 2 barrels and saw one of them in two in the centre, and put one-half 
on the top, and the other at the bottom of the whole barrel, (or you may 
use three whole barrels if you like.) The middle barrel is to be filled 
with maple, beech, of baswood shavings, which are to be planed from the 
edge of boards only two or three feet long, which allows the shavings to 
roll, and prevents them form packing tight, and also allows air to 
circulate through them, which is admitted through a number of inch holes, 
which are to be made near the bottom of the barrel and just above the 
faucet, which lets the vinegar run into the tub below. The top tub has its 
bottom pierced with small bit holes, having several threads of twine 
hanging in them to conduct the vinegar evenly over the top of the shavings 
in the middle of the barrel. Air must be permitted to pass out between the 
top tub and barrel, which comes in at the holes in the bottom. The 
shavings which fill the barrel must be soaked three or four days in good 
vinegar before they are put in. When thus arranged, for every gallon of 
water use 1/2 lb. of sugar; (that you get from molasses barrels does vary 
well.) If you wish to make vinegar from whiskey, put in 4 gallons of water 
to 1 gallon of whiskey; and if from cider, put in one-third water, and 
fill the top tub with this fluid, putting 1 pint good yeast to each barrel 
making; and have the holes with threads or twine so arranged that it will 
run through every twelve hours; and dip or pump up with a wooden pump
every night or morning, and three days will make good substantial vinegar, 





which will keep and also improve by age. Some use only 1 gallon of whiskey 
to 7 gallons of water. This accounts for so much poor vinegar. Make good 
vinegar, it will pay you. If a few gallons of water if made boiling hot so 
as to warm the whole of a gentle warmth, it will make faster than if used 
cold. This must be done in cool weather, and the room also should be kept 
warm. For families, small kegs will do, but for manufacturers large casks 
are best. Many make vinegar by just putting fluid into the barrels of 
shavings, soaked as directed above, and do not let it run through, but let 
it stand in the shavings till sour; but it does not work fast enough for 
manufacturers. It will do where only a small amount is needed, keeping the 
same strength of fluid as for the other plan, which is best. Two or three 
years ago, this receipt was sold for from $50 to $150. If vinegar is made 
from whiskey, it will have a more beautiful color if 5 or 6 lbs. of sugar 
is put into each barrel, of course keeping the same proportions of water 
as though only one kind was used. The shavings will last the whole season.

                              31. CUBA HONEY
Good brown sugar 11 lbs., water 1 quart, old bee honey in the comb 2 lbs., 
cream tartar 50 grains, gum arabic 1 oz., oil of peppermint 5 drops, oil 
of rose 2 drops, mix and boil two or three minutes and remove from the 
fire, have ready strained one quart of water, in which a table-spoonful of 
pulverized slippery elm bark has stood sufficiently long to make it ropy 
and thick life honey, mix this into the kettle with egg well beat up, skim 
well in a few minutes, and when a little cool, add two pounds of nice 
strained bees' honey, and then strain the whole, and you will have not 
only an article which looks and tastes like honey, but which possesses all 
its medicinal properties. It has been shipped in large quantities under 
the name of Cuba honey. It will keep fresh and nice for any length of time 
if properly covered.

                            32. EXCELLENT HONEY
Take 5 lbs. of good common sugar, two pounds of water, gradually bring to 
a boil, skimming well, when cool, add 1 lb. bees' honey, and 4 drops of 
peppermint. If you desire a better article use white sugar and 1/2 lb. 
less water, and one half pound more honey.

                               33. GUNPOWDER
Take pulverized saltpetre, moisten it, and subject it to the action of a 
slow fire until completely dried and granulated, of this take 75 parts, 
purified sugar 12 and a-half parts, moisten and grind together till 
completely blended, which will require several hours, pulverize on heaters 
till dried.

                           34. EXCELLENT MATCHES
The ends of the tapers or wood should be very dry, and then dipped in hot 
melted sulphur and laid aside to dry; then take 4 parts of glue, dissolve 
it and while hot add one part of phosphorus, and stir in a few spoonsful 
of fine whiting to bring to the proper thickness. This preparation should 
be kept hot by being suspended over a lamp, while dipping the wood or 
tapers. Colour the mixture by adding a little vermillion, lamp black or 
prussian blue; be careful not to ignite the compound while dipping.





35. FIRE AND WATER-PROOF CEMENT
To half a pint of milk add half a pint of vinegar to curdle it; then 
separate the curd from the whey, and mix the whey with 4 or 5 eggs; 
beating the whole well together; when it is well mixed, add a little 
quick-lime through a sieve, until it has acquired the consistence of a 
thick paste. This is a prime article for cementing marble, in or out of 
the weather. It is excellent for broken vessels, &c.

                          36.FRENCH CHEMICAL SOAP
Take 5 lbs. castile soap, cut fine, 1 pint alcohol, 1 pint soft water, 2 
ounces aquafortis (if for black cloth 1/2 ounce of lampblack,) 2 ounces 
saltpetre, 3 ounces potash, 1 ounce camphor, 4 ounces cinnamon in powder. 
Fist dissolve the soap, potash, and saltpetre by boiling, then add all the 
other articles, and continue to stir until it cools, then pour it into a 
box, let it stand 24 hours, and cut it into cakes. It is used for taking 
grease, stains, and paints from cloth, wood, &c. This receipt has 
frequently sold for $10.

                      37. BLACK INK WITHOUT SEDIMENT
This ink is not injured by frost - is a beautiful article, and only costs 
5 cents. per gallon, and is sold for from $1 to $3.
Take 1 lb. logwood, 1 gallon soft water, simmer in an iron vessel for one 
hour, then dissolve in a little hot water 24 grains bychromate of potash, 
and 12 grains prussiate of potash, and stir into the liquid while over the 
fire, then take it off and strain it through fine cloth. This ink is a jet 
black flows freely from the pen and will stand the test of oexylic acid.

                             38. INDELIBLE INK
1 inch of the stick of the nitrate of silver dissolved in a little water, 
and stirred into each gallon of the above, makes first rate indelible ink 
for cloth. Judge what indelible ink costs.

                             39. INDELIBLE INK
Nitrate of silver 1 1/2 oz., dissolved in liquor ammonia fortisine 5 1/2 
oz., orchil for colouring 3/4 oz., gum mucilage 12 oz., mix the two 
latter, then mix them with the two former, and it is ready to use.

                  40. WRITING FLUID OR BLACK COPYING INK
Take two gallons of rain water and put into it gum arabic 1/4 lb., brown 
sugar 1/4 lb., clean copperas 1/4 lb., powdered nut galls 3/4 lb., mix and 
shake occasionally for ten days and strain. If needed sooner, let it stand 
in an iron kettle until the strength is obtained. This ink can be depended 
on for deeds or records, which you may want someone to read hundreds of 
years to come. Oexylic acid 1/4 oz., was formerly put in, but as it 
destroys the steel pens, and does just as well without it - it is now 
never used.

                            41. BEST INK POWDER
This is formed of the dry ingredients for ink, powdered and mixed. Take 
powdered galls one pound, powdered green vitriol half a pound, powdered 
gum 4 ounces, mix all together, put it up into 2 ounce packages, each of 
which will make a pint if ink.






                             42. BEST RED INK
Take of best carmine (nakarot) 2 grains, rain water 1/2 ounce, water of 
ammonia 20 drops, add a little gum arabic, and it is in a few minutes 
ready for use.

                              43. YELLOW INK
Dissolve alum in saffron water to whatever shade of yellow you please. It 
makes a beautiful ink.

                               44. BLUE INK
Take Prussian blue, and oexylic acid, in equal parts, powder finely, and 
add soft water to bring it to a soft paste, and let it stand for a few 
days, then add soft water to the desired shade of colour; add a little gum 
arabic to prevent spreading.

                              45. GOLDEN INK
Take some white gum arabic, reduce it to an impalpable powder in a brass 
mortar, dissolve it in strong brandy, and add a little common water to 
render it more liquid, provide some gold in a shell, which must be 
detached in order to reduce it to a powder, when this is done moisten it 
with the gum solution, and stir the whole with a small hair brush, or your 
finger, then leave it for a night that the gold may be better dissolved. 
If the composition becomes dry during the night, dilute it with more gum 
water in which a little saffron has been infused, but take care that the 
gold solution be sufficiently liquid to flow freely in a pen; when the 
writing is dry polish it with a dry tooth.

                 46. WHITE INK FOR WRITING ON BLACK PAPER
Having carefully washed some egg shells remove the internal skin and grind 
them on a piece of porphyry, then put the powder in a small vessel of pure 
water, and when it has settled at the bottom, draw off the water and dry 
the powder in the sun. This powder must be preserved in a bottle; when you 
want to use it put a small quantity of gum ammoniac into distilled 
vinegar, and leave it to dissolve during the night, next morning the 
solution will appear exceedingly white, and if you then strain it through 
a piece of linen cloth, and add to it the powder of egg shells in 
sufficient quantity, you will obtain a very white ink.

    47. SECRET INK FOR YOUNG LADIES AND GENTS
Take a drachm of clean rain water, put into it, in a clean vial, 10 or 12 
drops of pure, clean sulphuric acid, and it is ready for use; write with 
this using a clean quill pen on letter paper, and when dry you can see no 
mark at all, then hold it to a strong heat and the writing becomes as 
black as jet. If you want to write to a young lady or gentleman, as the 
case may be, and fearing that the letter might be opened before she or he 
gets it, write with common black ink something of no importance, then 
between the lines write what you want to say with the secret ink. The 
person to whom you are writing must understand the scheme so that she or 
he may hold it to the heat and thereby make the writing visible.





                         48. CIDER WITHOUT APPLES
To each gallon of cold water put 1 lb. common sugar, 1/2 ounce of tartaric 
acid, one tablespoonful of yeast, shake well, make in an evening and it 
will be fit for use next day. I make in a keg a few gallons at a time, 
leaving a few quarts to make into next time, not using yeast again until 
the keg needs rinsing. If it gets a little sour, make a little more into 
it or put as much water with it as there is cider and put it with the 
vinegar. If it is desired to bottle this cider by manufacturers of small 
drinks, you will proceed as follows: put in a barrel 5 gallons of hot 
water, 30 lbs. of brown sugar, 3/4 lb. of tartaric acid, 25 gallons of 
cold water, 3 pints of hop or brewer's yeast, work into paste with 3/4 lb. 
of flower, and one pint water will be required in making this paste; put 
all together in a barrel which it will fill and let it work 24 hours, the 
yeast running out at the bung all the time by putting in a little 
occasionally to keep it full; then bottle, putting in two or three broken 
raisins to each bottle, and it will nearly equal champagne.

                        49 SPRUCE OR AROMATIC BEER
Take 3 gallons of water, 2 1/2 pints molasses, 3 eggs well beaten, 1 gill 
yeast, put into two quarts of the water boiling hot, put in 50 drops of 
any oil you wish the flavour of, or mix one ounce each, oil sarsafras, 
spruce, and wintergreen; then use the 50 drops. For ginger flavour take 2 
ounces ginger root bruised and a few hops, and boil for 30 minutes in one 
gallon of the water, strain and mix all; let it stand 2 hours and bottle, 
using yeast, of course, as before.

                              50. LEMON BEER
To make 20 gallons, boil 6 ounces of ginger root bruised, 1/4 lb. 
cream-tartar for 20 or 30 minutes in 2 or 3 gallons of water; this will be 
strained into 13 lbs. of coffer sugar on which you have put 1 oz. oil of 
lemon and six good lemons all squeezed up together, having warm water 
enough to make the whole 20 gallons, just so you can hold your hand in it 
without burning, or some 70 degrees of heat; put in 1 1/2 pint hops or 
brewer's yeast worked into paste as for cider, with 5 or 6 oz. of flower; 
let it work over night, then strain and bottle for use. This will keep a 
number of days.

                           51. PHILADELPHIA BEER
Take 30 gallons of water, brown sugar 20 lbs., ginger root bruised 1/4 
lb., cream tartar 1 1/4 lb., carbonate of soda 3 ounces, oil of lemon 1 
teaspoonful, put in a little alcohol, the white of 10 eggs well beaten, 
hops 2 ounces, yeast one quart. The ginger root and hops should be boiled 
for 20 or 30 minutes in enough of the water to make all milk warm; then 
strain into the rest, and the yeast added and allowed to work itself clear 
as the cider and bottled.

                           52. SILVER TOP DRINK
Take of water 3 quarts, white sugar 4 lbs., oil of lemons one teaspoonful, 
white of 5 eggs, beaten with one teaspoonful of flour; boil to form syrum, 
then divide into equal parts, and to one add 3 ounces of tartaric acid, 
and to the other part 4 oz. of carbonate of soda, then take two thirds of 
a glass of water, and put in a spoonful of each of the syrups, more or 
less, according to the size of the glass.





                   53. DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SODA DRINKS
In getting up any of the soda drinks which are spoken of hereafter it will 
be preferable to put about 4 oz. of carbonate (sometimes called 
supercarbonate) of soda into one pint of water, and shake when you wish to 
make a glass of soda, and pour from this into the glass until if foams 
well instead of using dry soda as directed.

                         54. IMPERIAL CREAM NECTAR
Part 1st. - Take 1 gallon water, 6 lbs. loaf sugar, 6 ounces tartaric 
acid, gum arabic 1 oz.
Part 2nd. - Take 4 teaspoonsful of flour, the whites of four eggs beat 
finely together, then add 1/2 pint of water. Heat the first part until it 
is blood warm, then put in the second, boil 3 minutes and it is done. 
Directions. - To 3 tablespoonfuls of the syrup in a glass half or two 
thirds full of water add one third of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda 
made fine, stir well, and drink at your leisure.

                        55. A SUPERIOR GINGER BEER
Take of sugar 10 lbs., lemon juice 9 oz., honey 1/2 lb., bruised ginger 
root 11 oz., water 9 galls., yeast 3 pints, boil the ginger in the water 
until the strength is all extracted, which you may tell be tasting the 
root, then pour it into a tub, throwing the roots away, let it stand until 
nearly luke warm, then put in all the rest of the ingredients, stir well 
until all dissolved, cover it over with a cloth, and if it be in the 
evening, let it remain until next morning, then strain through cloth, and 
bottle it, and in a short time it will be fit for use. Some use less 
sugar, and some less lemon juice, to make it with less expense; but it is 
not so elegant a drink as this.

                           56. GINGER POP No. 1
Take of water 5 1/2 galls., ginger root bruised 3/4 lb., tartaric acid 1/2 
oz., white sugar 2 1/4 lbs., the whites of 3 eggs well beat, a small 
teaspoonful of oil of lemon, yeast 1 gill; boil the root for 30 minutes in 
1 gallon of the water, strain off, and put the oil in while hot, mix all 
well, make over night, in the morning skim, and bottle, keeping out 
sediment.

                           57. GINGER POP No. 2
Take best white Jamaica ginger root bruised 2 oz., water 6 quarts, boil 20 
minutes and strain, then add cream tartar 1 oz., white sugar 1 lb.; put on 
the fire, then stir until all the sugar is dissolved; then put into an 
earthen jar, now put in tartaric acid 1/4 oz., and the rind of 1 lemon, 
let it stand until 70 degrees of Fahrenheit, or until you can bear your 
hand in it with comfort, then add two tablespoonsful of yeast, stir well, 
bottle for use, and tie the corks; make a few days before it is wanted for 
use.

                                 58. YEAST
Take a good single handfull of hops, and boil for 20 minutes in 3 pints of 
water, then strain, and stir in a teacupful of flour, a tablespoonful of 
sugar, and a teaspoonful of salt; when a little cool put in 1 gill of 
brewer's yeast, and after four or five hours cover up, and stand in a cool 
place for use; make again from this unless you let it get sour.







                              59. SODA SYRUPS
Take of loaf or crushed sugar 8 lbs., pure water 1 gall., gum arabic 1 
oz., mix in a brass or copper kettle, boil until the gum is dissolved, 
then skim and strain through white flannel, after which add tartaric acid 
5 1/2 oz., dissolved in hot water. To flavour use extract of lemon, 
orange, rose, sarsaparilla, strawberry, &c., 1/2 oz., or to your taste. If 
you use the juice of lemon, add 1 1/2 lbs., of sugar to a pint; you do not 
need any tartaric acid with it; now use 2 or 3 tablespoonsful of syrup to 
3/4 of a tumbler of water, and 1/3 teaspoonsful of supercarbonate of soda 
made fine, stir well and be ready to drink; the gum arabic, however, holds 
the carbonic acid so it will not fly off so readily as common soda. For 
soda fountains, 1 oz., of supercarbonate of soda is used to 1 gallon of 
water. for charged fountains no acids are needed in the syrups.

                             60. MINERAL WATER
Epsom salts 1 oz., cream tartar 1/2 oz., tartaric acid 1/4 oz., loaf sugar 
1 lb., oil of birch 20 drops; put 1 quart boiling water on all these 
articles, and add 3 quarts of cold water to 2 tablespoonsful of yeast; let 
it work 2 hours and then bottle.

                     61. IMPROVED ENGLISH STRONG BEER
If you have malt use it, if not, take 1 peck of barley, and put it into a 
stove oven, and steam the moisture from them, grind coarsely, and pour 
into them 3 1/2 gallons of water, at 170 or 172 degrees. (If you use malt 
it does not need quite so much water, as it does not absorb so much as the 
other. The tub should have a false bottom with many gimblet holes to keep 
back the grain.) Stir them well and let stand 3 hours and draw off, put on 
7 gallons more water at 180 or 182 degrees, stir well, let stand 2 hours 
and draw off, then put 1 gallon or 2 of cold water, stir well and draw 
off; you should have about 5 or 6 gallons; mix 6 lbs., coarse brown sugar 
in equal amount of water, add 4 oz. of good hops, boil for 1 1/2 hour; you 
should have from 8 to 10 gallons when boiled; when cooled to 80 degrees, 
put in a teacupful of good yeast and let it work 18 hours covered with a 
sack. Use sound iron-hooped kegs, or porter bottles, bung or cork tight, 
and in two weeks it will be good sound beer, nearly equal in strength to 
London porter, or good ale, and will keep a long time.

62. SANGAREE
Take wine, ale, or porter, 1/3, and 2/3 water, hot, or cold, according to 
the season of the year,loaf sugar to the taste with nutmeg.

                              63. GINGER WINE
Put 1 oz. good ginger root bruised in 1 quart of 95 per cent. alcohol, let 
it stand 9 days, and strain, add 4 quarts of water, and 1 lb. of white 
sugar, dissolved in hot water, 1 pint port wine to this quantity, for what 
you retail at your own bar makes it far better; colour with tincture of 
saunders to suit; drink freely of this hot on going to bed, when you have 
a bad cold, and in the morning you will bless ginger wine.






                               64. HOP BEER
Take of hops 6 oz., molasses 5 quarts, boil the hops in water till the 
strength is out, strain them into a 30 gallon barrel, add the molasses and 
a teacupful of yeast, and fill up with water, shake it well and leave the 
bung out until fermented, which will be in about 24 hours; bung up, and it 
will be fit for use in about 3 days. A most excellent summer drink, 
smaller quantities in proportion.

65. USQUEBAUGH OR IRISH WHISKEY
Best brandy 1 gallon, stoned raisins 1 lb., cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and 
cardamom, each 1 oz., crushed in a morter, saffron 1/2 oz., or the rind of 
1 Seville orange, and a little sugar candy; shake these well, and it is 
ready for use in 14 days.

                               66. ICE CREAM
Add a little rich sweet cream, and 1/2 lb. of loaf sugar to each quart of 
cream or milk; if you cannot get cream the best imitation is to boil a 
soft custard; 6 eggs to each quart of milk, (eggs well beaten); or another 
way, boil a quart of milk, and stir into it, while boiling, a 
tablespoonful of arrow-root, wet with cold milk, then cool stir in the 
yolk of one egg, to give a rich colour; five minutes boiling is enough for 
either plan; put the sugar in after they cool, keep the same proportions 
for any amount desired. The juice of strawberries, or raspberries, give a 
beautiful colour and flavour to ice creams; or about 1/2 oz. of the 
essence or extracts to a gallon, or to suit the taste. Have your ice well 
broken, add 1 quart of salt to a bucket of ice, then place in this the 
vessel containing your cream, and about one half hour's constant stirring 
and occasional scraping down and beating together will freeze it.

                           67. CHICAGO ICE CREAM
Irish moss soaked in warm water about an hour, and rinsed well to clear it 
of a certain foreign taste, then steep it in milk, keeping it just at the 
point of boiling or simmering for an hour, or until a rich yellow colour 
is given to the milk, without cream or eggs; 1 or 1 1/2 oz. of moss is 
enough for a gallon of cream, and this will do to steep twice. Sweeten and 
flavour as other cream.

                              68. CREAM SODA
Loaf sugar 10 lb., water 3 gills, mix, and warm gradually, so as not to 
burn, good rich cream 2 quarts, extract vanilla 1 1/2 oz., extract nutmeg 
1/4 oz., and tartaric acid 4 oz.; just bring to a boiling heat; for if you 
cook it any length of time it will crystallize. Use 4 or 5 spoonsful of 
this syrup instead of 3, as in other syrups; put 1/3 teaspoonful of soda 
to a glass, if used without fountain. For charged fountains no acid is 
used.

                              69. LEMON SYRUP
Take of the juice of lemons one pint, white sugar one and a half pound, 
and a little of the peel. Mix and boil a few minutes, strain, and when a 
little cool, bottle, and cork, for use.










70. ORANGE AND RASPBERRY SYRUPS
Take of the juice of either, as the case may be, one pint; white sugar one 
and a half pound. If it be orange a little of the peel; tartaric acid 4 
oz. Mix and boil a few minutes; strain, and when a little cool, bottle and 
cork for use. When to be drank, mix three or four tablespoonsful of syrup 
with three quarters of a glass of water, and add a teaspoonful of soda. If 
water be added to the syrup it will not keep well.

                               71. PURE WINE
Take three pounds of nice raisins free of stems, cut each one in two or 
three pieces, put them into a stone jug with one gallon pure soft water, 
let them stand two weeks uncovered, shaking occasionally (put in a warm 
place in winter,) strain through three or four thicknesses of woollen, or 
filter; colour with burned sugar; bottle and cork for use. For saloon 
purposes, add one pint of good brandy. The more raisins the better the 
wine, not exceeding 5 lbs.

                           72 PURE WINE VINEGAR
This is made by putting the same quantity of water on the above raisins, 
after the wine is poured off, as at first for making wine, and standing 
the same length of time, in the same way.

                               73. PORT WINE
Take 42 gallons of worked cider, 12 gallons of good port wine, 3 gallons 
good brandy, 6 gallons pure spirits. Mix together. Elder-berries and 
sloes, or fruit of the black hawes, make a fine purple colour for wines.

                            74. CHAMPAGNE WINE
Take of good cider (crab-apple cider is best) seven gallons, best fourth 
proof brandy one quart, genuine champagne wine five quarts, milk one gill, 
bitartrate of potash 2 oz. Mix and let it stand a short time; bottle while 
fermenting. This makes an excellent imitation of champagne with age.

                     75. CURRANT AND OTHER FRUIT WINES
For currant, cherry, raspberry, elderberry, strawberry, whortleberry, and 
wild grape wines, any one can be used alone, or in combination of several 
of the different kinds; to make a variety of flavours, or suit persons who 
have some and not the other kinds of fruits, to every gallon of expressed 
juice, add 2 galls. of soft water, put in 6 or 8 lbs. of brown sugar, and 
1 1/2 oz. of cream of tartar, have them dissolved; put 1 quart of brandy 
to every 6 galls. Some prefer it without brandy. After fermentation, take 
4 oz. isinglass, dissolved in a pint of the wine, put to each barrel, and 
it will refine and clear it; then it must be drawn off into clear casks, 
or bottled, which is far the best. Give these wines age and they are most 
delicious.







                  76. DINNER WINE OR ENGLISH PATENT WINE
From garden rhubarb, which will not lend to intemperance. An agreeable and 
healthy wine is very frequently made from the expressed juice of the 
garden rhubarb. To each gallon of juice add 1 gallon of soft water, in 
which 7 lbs. of brown sugar have been dissolved; fill a keg or barrel with 
this proportion, leaving the bung out, and keep it filled with sweetened 
water as it works off until clear. Any other vegetable extract may be 
added, if this flavour is not liked. Then bung down, or bottle, as you 
desire. These stalks will furnish about 3/4 their weight in juice; fine 
and settle with isinglass, as in the fruit wines. This has been patented 
in England.

                             77. VARIOUS WINES
Take 28 gallons of clarified cider; 1 gallon geed brandy, 1 lb. crude 
tartar, (this is what is deposited by grape wines) 5 gallons of any wine 
you wish to represent, 1 pint of sweet milk to settle it; draw off in 24 
or 36 hours after thoroughly mixing.

                    78. BLACKBERRY AND STRAWBERRY WINES
These are made by taking the above wine when made with port wine; and for 
every 10 gallons, form 4 to 6 quarts of the fresh fruit, bruised and 
strained, are added, and let it stand till the flavour is extracted; more 
or less may be used to suit the tastes of different persons. In bottling 
any of those wines 3 or four broken raisins put into each bottle will add 
to their richness and flavour.

                             79. FRENCH BRANDY
Take of pure spirit 1 gallon, best French brandy, or any kind you wish to 
imitate, even Otard, 1 quart; loaf sugar 2 oz., sweet spirits of nitre 1/2 
oz., a few drops of tincture of catechu, or oak bark, to roughen the taste 
if desired; colour to suit your taste, and bottle.

                        80. BRANDY FROM OIL COGNAC
Take of pure spirits 10 gallons, New England rum 2 quarts, or Jamaica rum 
1 quart, and oil cognac from 30 to 40 drops, put in half a pint of 
alcohol, colour with tincture of kino, or burned sugar, which is generally 
preferred. Mix well and bottle.

                              81. PALE BRANDY
This is made as the French brandy, using pale instead of the French, and 
using 1 oz. of tincture of kino for colour, only for 5 gallons.

                             82 CHERRY BRANDY
To every 10 gallons of brandy add 3 quarts of wild black cherries, stones 
and all bruised, and crushed sugar 2 lbs. Let it stand until the strength 
and flavour is obtained, and draw from it as wanted for use. Never attempt 
to use oil of bitter almonds for this purpose, instead of the cherries, 
for it is a most deadly poison.








                           83. BLACKBERRY BRANDY
Take of brandy 10 gallons, nice rich blackberries mashed from 4 to 6 
quarts, according to the degree of flavour you wish. Mix and add a little 
sugar to overcome the acidity of the berries, according to their ripeness 
will the amount vary from one to 4 oz. to each gallon.

                           84. STRAWBERRY BRANDY
This is made as the above, using very nice ripe strawberries, and only 
about half the quantity of sugar.

                     Receipts 85, 86 & 87 not printed

                              88. HOLLAND GIN
Take of pure spirits 1 gallon, best Holland gin, schnapps, or any kind 
desired, 1 quart, oil of juniper 2 scruples, oil of anise 1/4 oz.; mix all 
well together.

89. COLOURING
Take of white sugar 1 lb., put it into an earthen kettle, moisten a 
little, let boil, and burn red, black and thick, remove from the fire and 
put in a little hot water to keep it from hardening as it cools. Use this 
to colour any liquors, needing colour, to your taste, or as near the 
colour of the liquor you imitate as you can. Tincture of kino is a good 
colour, and is made by dissolving 1 oz. of kino in a pint of alcohol. For 
a cherry red use tincture of saffron; for light amber to deep brown use 
sugar colouring; for brandy colour, sugar; for red use beet root or 
saunders; for port wine colour use extract of rhatany.

                  90 TO KEEP SWEET AND SWEETEN SOUR CIDER
To keep cider sweet take a keg, put several holes in the bottom of it, and 
a piece of woollen cloth at the bottom, then fill with pure sand closely 
packed, then pass your cider through this, and put up in clean barrels 
that have had a piece of cotton or linen cloth 2 by 6 inches, dipped in 
sulphur, and burned in them, then keep in a cool place and add 1/2 lb. of 
white mustard seed to each barrel. If cider is souring, about 1 quart of 
hickory ashes, (or a little more of other hard wood ashes), stirred into 
each barrel, will sweeten and clarify it, nearly equal to rectifying; but 
if it is not rectified it must be racked off to get clear of pomace, for 
while this is in it, it will remain sour. Oil or whiskey barrels are best 
to put up cider in, or 1/2 pint of sweet oil, or a gallon of whiskey, or 
both may be added to a barrel with decidedly good effects. Isinglass 4 oz. 
to each barrel helps to clarify and settle cider that is not going to be 
rectified.

91. SCHRUB
Take of lemon juice 1 pint, white sugar 2 pints, rum 3 pints, water 4 
pints; mix and colour ready for use.










92. STOUGHTON BITTERS
Take of gentian 4 oz., orange peel 4 oz., columbo 4 oz., chamomile flowers 
4 oz., quassia 4 oz., burned sugar 1 lb., whiskey 2 1/2 galls., water 2 
1/2 galls,; mix and let stand one week, then bottle the clear liquor.

93. TO IMPROVE THE FLAVOUR OF NEW WHISKEY
Take of whiskey 1 gall., add tea 4 oz., allspice 4 oz., caraway seed 4 
oz., cinnamon 2 oz., shake occasionally for a week and use one pint to a 
barrel. Keep this mixture in a jug.

                        94. CHERRY BOUNCE OR BRANDY
Take 10 galls. of good whiskey, put into it from 4 to 6 quarts of wild 
black cherries with the stones broken, common almonds shelled 1 lb., white 
sugar 1 1/2 lb., cinnamon 1/2 oz., nutmeg 1/2 oz., all bruised. Let stand 
12 or 13 days and draw off; this, with the addition of 2 galls. of brandy, 
make very nice cherry brandy.

95 MONONGAHALE
Take of good common whiskey 36 gall., dried peaches 2 quarts, rye, burned 
and ground as coffee, 1 quart, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice, bruised, of 
each 1 oz., loaf sugar 5 lbs., sweet spirits of nitre 2 oz., put all these 
articles into 4 galls. of pure spirits, and shake every day for a week, 
then draw off through a woollen cloth, and add the whole to the 36 galls. 
of whiskey.

                              96. RYE WHISKEY
Take of dried peaches 1/2 a peck, put them into a pan in a stove, scorch a 
little, not to burn however, then bruise, and place in a woollen (pointed) 
bag, and leach good common whiskey over them twice, having the barrel up 
so as to hang the bag under the faucet and draw slowly over them; this is 
for a barrel. Add 10 or 12 drops of aqua ammonia to each barrel, after 
leaching through the peaches; with age this is nearly, if not quite, equal 
to whiskey made from rye.

                            97. STOMACH BITTERS
Take of gentian root 6 oz., orange peel 10 oz., cinnamon 1 oz., anise seed 
2 0z., coriander seed 2 oz., cardamom seed 1/2 oz., Peruvian bark, 
unground, 2 oz., bruise all the articles and add of gum kino 1 oz., and 
put them into 2 quarts of alcohol, and two quarts of pure spirits or good 
whiskey; shake occasionally for 10 or 12 days, and strain or filter 
through several thicknesses of woollen. Half a pint of this may be added 
to a gallon of whiskey, more or less, as desired, and you have an article 
as good, or better, and more healthy than that for which you will pay 
three times as much; or you may use it the same as stoughton, to which it 
is preferred.






                          98. PEPPERMINT CORDIAL
Take of good whiskey 10 galls., water 10 galls., white sugar 10 lbs., oil 
of peppermint 1 oz., flour 1 oz., burned sugar 1/2 lb. to colour, alcohol 
1 pint; put the oil of peppermint in the alcohol, then with this work the 
flour well, add the burned sugar, work again, and mix all the ingredients 
together; let them stand a week and they are ready for use. If you wish a 
different flavour from that of oil of peppermint use any other oil of 
which you desire the flavour.

99. ST. CROIX RUM
Take of pure spirits 28 galls., of pure St. Croix run 3 galls., sal 
ammonia (cut in alcohol) 1 OZ., sweet spirits of nitre 6 ozs., mix all 
together and let stand for 24 hours, occasionally shaking, and it is ready 
for use.

                               100. LEMONADE
Take of fresh lemon juice 4 oz., fresh lemon peel 1/2 oz., white sugar 4 
oz., boiling water 3 pints; mix all together; let them stand till cool, 
and then strain off for use; if you wish you can cool at once with ice. 
Where this is used as a cooling drink in fevers a little sweet spirits of 
nitre may be added.

                        101. A BRILLIANT WHITEWASH
This bears a gloss like ivory, and will not rub off. Take of clean 
unslacked lime 5 or 6 quarts, slack with hot water in a tub, cover to keep 
in the steam; when ready, pass it through a fine sieve, and add 1/4 lb. of 
whiting, 1 lb. of good sugar pulverized, and 3 pints of rice flour, first 
made into a thin paste; boil this mixture well, then dissolve 1 lb. of 
clean glue in water, and add it to the mixture, and apply while warm with 
a whitewash brush, except when particular neatness is required you may 
then use a paint brush; in both cases put it on warm. You may add 
colouring matter to give it any shade you please.

                          102. CHANGING VARNISHES
Varnishes of this description are call changing because, when applied to 
metals such as copper, brass, or tin or silver foil, they give them a more 
agreeable colour; indeed, the common metals, when coated with them 
acquired a lustre approaching to that of the precious metals, and hence 
these varnishes are much employed in manufacturing imitations of gold and 
silver. Put four ounces of the best gum gamboge into 32 ozs. of spirits of 
turpentine, 4 ozs. of dragon's blood into the same quantity of spirits of 
turpentine as the gamboge, and 1 oz. of anatto into 8 ozs. of the same 
spirits. The three mixtures being made in different vessels, they should 
then be kept for about a fortnight in a warm place, and as much exposed to 
the sun a possible; at the end of that time they will be fit for use; and 
you can procure any tints you wish by making a composition from them, with 
such proportions of each liquor as practice and the nature of the colour 
you are desirous of obtaining will point out. Changing varnishes may 
likewise be employed, with very good effect, for furniture, such as 
picture frames, &c. - See Lackers.






103. GOLD LACKER OR VARNISH
In using the changing varnish or any of these lackers, for picture frames 
for instance, lay them over with tin or silver foil, by means of plaster 
of Paris glue, or cement of some kind, that the foil may be perfectly 
adherent to the wood, then apply your varnish; apply as many coats as may 
suit your taste, and if it be the gold lacker you use it has the 
appearance of being laid with gold leaf, and if the pale brass lacker, of 
being laid with brass, &c., and if you use the changing varnish you may 
make it just what colour you wish, by mixing the three materials in 
different proportions. For making gold lacker, put into a clean 4 gallon 
tin 1 lb. ground turmeric, 1 1/2 oz. powdered gamboge, 3 1/2 lbs. powdered 
gum sandrack, 3/4 lb. shellac, and 2 galls. spirits of wine; after being 
dissolved and strained add 1 pint of turpentine varnish, receipt No.112, 
well mixed, and it is ready for use.

      104. RED SPIRIT LACKER
Take 2 galls. spirits of wine, 1 lb. dragon's blood, 3 lbs. Spanish 
annatto, 3 1/2 lbs. gum sandrack, 2 pints turpentine. Made exactly as the 
gold lacker.

     105 PALE BRASS LACKER
Take 2 galls. spirits of wine, 3 ozs. cape aloes, cut small, 1 lb. fine 
pale shellac, 1 oz. gamboge, cut small, no turpentine. Varnish made 
exactly as before, but observe, that those who make lackers frequently 
want some paler and some darker and sometimes inclining more to the 
particular tint of certain of the component ingredients; therefore if a 4 
oz. vial of a strong solution of each ingredient be prepared, a lacker of 
any tint can be prepared at any time as by changing varnish.

106. DEMAR VARNISH
This is a fine clear varnish, being harder and less coloured than mastic, 
while it is as soluble, and may be had at one-tenth the price. Put 6 oz. 
of gum demar in a bottle with 10 ozs. of spirits of turpentine, and put 
into another bottle 6 ozs. of gum demar, with 16 ozs. alcohol, when they 
are dissolved put them together, and you have an excellent cheap varnish 
which dries quickly and is very clear.

107. COPAL VARNISH
Take 1 oz. of copal, and 1/2 oz. of shellac, powder them well and put them 
into a bottle or jar containing 1 quart of spirits of wine; place the 
mixture in a warm place and shake it occasionally, till you see that the 
gums are completely dissolved, and when strained the varnish is fit for 
use.

                          108. WHITE HARD VARNISH
Take 1 lb. of mastic, 4 oz. of gum anima; and 5 lbs. of gum sandrack, put 
them all together to dissolve, into a vessel containing 2 oz. of rectified 
spirits of wine, which should be kept in a warm place and frequently 
shaken till all the gums are quite dissolved; then strain the mixture 
through a lawn sieve, and it will be fit for use.







                           109. CRYSTAL VARNISH
Procure a bottle of Canada balsam, which can be had at any druggist's; 
draw out he cork and set the bottle of balsam at a little distance from 
the fire, turning it round several times, until the heat has thinned it; 
then have something that will hold as much as double the quantity of 
balsam; carry the balsam from the fire, and, while fluid mix it with the 
same quantity of good turpentine, and shake them together until they are 
well incorporated. In a few days the varnish is fit for use, particularly 
if it is poured into a half gallon glass or stone bottle, and kept in a 
gentle warmth. This varnish is used for maps, prints, charts, drawings, 
paper, ornaments, &c.

               110. BLACK VARNISH FOR OLD STRAW OR CHIP HATS
Take a 1/2 oz. of the best black sealing wax, pound it well, and put it 
into a 4 oz. vial, containing 2 ozs. of rectified spirits of wine; place 
it in a sand-bath or near a moderate fire till the wax is dissolved, then 
lay it on warm, with a fine soft hairbrush, before a fire or in the sun. 
It gives a good stiffness to old straw hats, and a beautiful gloss equal 
to new. It likewise resists wet.

                       111. VARNISH FOR VIOLINS &c.
Take 1 gallon of rectified spirits of wine, 12 ozs. of mastic, and 1 pint 
of turpentine varnish; put them altogether in a tin can, and keep it in a 
very warm place, shaking it occasionally till it is perfectly dissolved; 
then strain it, and it is fit for use. If you find it necessary, you may 
dilute it with turpentine varnish. This varnish is also very useful for 
furniture of plumtree, mahogany, or rosewood.

                          112. TURPENTINE VARNISH
Take 5 lbs. of clear good resin, pound it well, and put it into 1 gallon 
of oil of turpentine; boil the mixture over a stove till the resin is 
perfectly dissolved, and when cool, it will be fit for use.

              113. IRON WORK BLACK OR BLACK VARNISH FOR IRON
Put 48 lbs. asphaltum into an iron pot, and boil for four hours; during 
the first two hours, introduce 7 lbs. litharge, 3 lbs. dried copperas, and 
10 gallons boiled oil; add 1/8 lb. run of dark gum, with 2 gallons hot 
oil; after pouring the oil and gum, continue the boiling two hours, or 
until it will roll into hard pills like Japan; when cool, thin it off with 
three gallons of turpentine, or until it is of proper consistence. This 
varnish is intended principally for the iron work of coaches and other 
carriages.

                          114 VARNISH FOR HARNESS
Take 1/2 lb. of india rubber, 1 gallon of spirits of turpentine; dissolve 
enough to make it into a jelly by keeping it almost new milk warm; then 
take equal quantities of good linseed oil, (in a hot state,) and the above 
mixture, incorporate them well on a slow fire, and it is fit for use.




                115. QUICK DRYING HARNESS BLACKING VARNISH
Break 1/2 cake (which is about 1 ounce) of white wax into an earthen pan, 
and just cover it with oil of turpentine; place a board over the pan to 
keep out the air; let it stand for 24 hours or until formed into a paste; 
then in another pan, mix 1 lb. of best ivory black with neatsfoot oil, 
until it assumes a thick consistency; then mix the contents of both pans 
together. It may be reduced with spirits of turpentine. Bottle, and it is 
fit for use.

                          116. OIL PASTE BLACKING
Take oil vitriol, 2 ozs., tanners oil, 5 ozs., ivory black, 2 lbs., 
molasses, 5 ozs; mix the oil and vitriol together, let it stand a day, 
then add the ivory black, the molasses, and the white of an egg; mix well, 
and it is ready for use.

                   117 WATER PROOF OIL OR PASTE BLACKING
Take 1 pint of camphene, and put into it all the india rubber it will 
dissolve, 1 pint currier's oil, 7 lbs. tallow, and 2 ozs. of lampblack; 
mix thoroughly by heat. This is a nice thing for old harness and carriage 
tops, as well as for boots and shoes.

                     118 BEST VARNISH BLACKING EXTANT
Take of alcohol, 1 gallon; white turpentine, 1 1/2 lbs.; gum shellac 1 1/2 
lbs.; venice turpentine, 1 gill; let these stand in a jug in the sun, or 
by a stove, until the gums are dissolved; then add sweet oil, 1 gill; 
lampblack, 2 oz., and you have a varnish that will not crack when the 
harness is twisted like the old shellac varnish. It is good also for boots 
and shoes, looking well, and turns water.

119. ASPHALTUM OR WALNUT STAIN
Take of asphaltum, 2 lbs.; boiled linseed oil, 1/2 pint; spirits of 
turpentine, 1 gallon; mix the two first in an iron pot, boil slowly until 
the asphaltum is melted, then take it some distance from the fire, cool a 
little, and add the turpentine (avoiding ignition) before it cools too 
much, and it is finished.

                       120. POLISH FOR OLD FURNITURE
Take 1 pint best spirits of wine, 1 pint raw linseed oil, 1 pint spirits 
of turpentine; mix all three together, and shake well before use. Apply 
with a rubber of cotton wool covered with a piece of clean old white 
cotton cloth. Apply slightly and you will be astonished at the effect. Old 
furniture that is scratched, soiled, or stained, if the wood is not torn 
up, being polished with this, has the appearance of new.

                  121. OIL TO MAKE THE HAIR GROW AND CURL
Take of olive oil 1/2 a pint, oils of rosemary and origanum, of each 1/8 
of an oz. Mix well and apply rather freely.

                          122. BEST SHAVING SOAP
Take 4 1/2 lbs. white bar soap, 1 quart rain water, 1 gill of beef's gall, 
and 1 gill spirits of turpentine; cut the soap thin, and boil five 
minutes, stir while boiling, and colour with 1/2 oz. of vermillion; scent 
with oil of rose or almonds. 10 cents worth will positively make $6 worth 
of soap.









                   123. NEW YORK BARBERS' STAR HAIR OIL
Take of castor oil, 6 1/2 pints; alcohol, 1 1/2 pint; citronella and 
lavender oils, of each 2 ozs.; mix and shake well, and it is ready for 
use.

124. ROWLAND'S MACASSAR HAIR OIL
Take of sweet oil, 8 ozs.; cantharides and oil of lemon, of each 60 drops; 
alkanet sufficient to colour it.

                            125. ROSE HAIR OIL
Take 1 quart olive oil, 2 1/2 ozs. alcohol, 1 1/2 ozs. rose oil; after 
this tie 1 oz. of chipped alkanet root in 3 or 4 little muslin bags, and 
let them lie in the oil until a pretty red is manifested, then change them 
to other oil. do not press them.

                              126. BEAR'S OIL
Take of good sweet lard oil, 1 quart; bergamot, 1 ounce; mix well together

                        127 OX MARROW FOR THE HAIR
Take of ox marrow, 4 ozs.; white wax, 1 oz.; nice fresh lard, 6 ozs; mix 
and melt; when cool, add 1 1/2 ozs. oil of bergamot, and mix well.

                               128. COLOGNE
Take oils of rosemary and lemon, of each, 1/4 oz.; oils of bergamot and 
lavender, of each, 1/8 oz.; oil of cinnamon, 8 drops; oils of cloves and 
rose, of each 15 drops; best alcohol, 2 quarts; mix and shake 2 or 3 times 
a day for a week. This will be better if deoderized, or cologne alcohol is 
used.

                              129. HARD SOAP
Take of soft soap, 12 lbs.; (that made of olive oil is best,) common salt, 
9 lbs.; mix and boil for 2 hours, run it into bars, or as you want it, and 
you will have 7 1/2 lbs. of soap. Add a little resin when you melt it 
over. Scent with fragrant oil if you wish to do so.

                               130. BAR SOAP
Take of lime water 1 teacupful, spirits of turpentine 2 teaspoonsful, 
resin 1/2 lb., sal. soda 1 1/2 lbs., of bar shop soap 4 lbs.; melt and 
boil all together to a proper consistency, then pour into moulds.

                           131. CARVER'S POLISH
In a pint of spirits of wine dissolve 2 oz. of seed lac, and 2 oz. of 
resin. The principal use of this polish is for the carved parts of cabinet 
work, such as standards, pillars, claws, &c. It should be laid on warm, 
and it will be still better; but all moisture and dampness should be 
carefully avoided.









                            132. FRENCH POLISH
Take 1 oz. of shellac, 1/4 oz. of gum-arabic, and 1/4 oz. of gum copal; 
bruise them well, and sift them through a piece of muslin, then put them 
along with a pint of spirits of win into a closely corked vessel, place it 
in a very warm situation, and shake it frequently every day till the gums 
are dissolved, then strain through a piece of muslin, and keep it corked 
for use.

133. WATER-PROOF POLISH
Put 2 ozs. of gum benjamin, 1/4 oz. of gum sandrac, and 1/4 oz. of gum 
anima, into a pint of spirits of wine, in a closely stopped bottle, place 
the bottle either in a sand bath, or in hot water, till the gums are 
dissolved, then strain off the mixture, shake it up with a 1/4 of a gill 
of the best clear poppy oil, and put by for use.

                           134 FINISHING POLISH
Put 2 drachms of shellac, and 2 drachms of gum benjamin, into 1/2 pint of 
the very best rectified spirits of wine, in a bottle closely corked; keep 
the bottle in a warm place, and shake it frequently till the gums are 
dissolved, when cold shake up with it 2 teaspoonsful of the best clear 
poppy oil, and it will be fit for use. This polish may be applied with 
great advantage after any of those mentioned in the foregoing receipts 
have been used. It removes the defects existing in them, increasing their 
lustre and durability, and gives the surface a most brilliant appearance.

                135. COMPOSITION USED IN WELDING CAST STEEL
Take of borax, 10 parts; sal-ammoniac, 1 part; grind or pound them roughly 
together, then fuse them in a metal pot over a close fire, taking care to 
continue the heat until all spume has disappeared from the surface, when 
the liquid appears clear, the composition is ready to be poured out to 
cool and concrete; afterward being ground to a fine powder. To use this 
composition, the steel to be welded is raised to a heat, which may be 
expressed by bright yellow, it is then dipped among the welding powder, 
and again placed in the fire until it attains the same degree of heat as 
before, it is then ready to be placed under the hammer.

                136. COMPOSITION USED IN WELDING CAST IRON
Take good clear white course sand, 3 parts; refined solton, 1 part; 
fosterine, 1 part; rock salt 1 part; borax, 1 part; mix all together. Take 
2 pieces of cast iron, heat them in a moderate charcoal fire, occasionally 
taking them out while heating, and dipping them into the composition, 
until they are of a proper heat to weld, then at once lay them on the 
anvil, and gently hammer them together, and if done carefully by one who 
understands welding iron, you will have them nicely welded together. One 
man prefers heating the metal, then cooling it in the water of common 
beans, and heating it again for welding.






                           137. CAST IRON CEMENT
Take of clean borings or turning of cast iron, 16 parts; of sal-ammoniac, 
2 parts; and flour of sulphur, 1 part; mix them well together on a mortar, 
and keep them dry. When required for use, take 1 part of the mixture, and 
20 parts of clean borings, mix thoroughly, and add a sufficient quantity 
of water. Note. - A little grindstone added improves the cement.
                            138. CASE HARDENING
This is the conversion of the surface of wrought iron into steel, for the 
purpose of adapting it to receive a polish, or to bear friction, &c. The 
best method in the world of effecting this is by heating the iron to 
cherry red in a close vessel, in contact with carbonacious material, and 
then plunging it into cold water. Bones, leather, hoofs, and horns of 
animals, are best for this purpose, after having been burnt or roasted, so 
that they can be pulverized. Soot is very frequently used; it answers, but 
not so well.

                       139. TO SOFTEN IRON OR STEEL
Either of the following simple methods will make iron or steel as soft as 
lead: - 1. Anoint it all over with tallow, temper it in a gentle charcoal 
fire, and let it cool of itself. 2. Take a little clay, cover your iron 
with it, temper in a charcoal fire. 3. When the iron or steel is red hot, 
strew hellebore on it. 4. Quench the iron or steel in the juice, or water, 
of common beans.

                           140. SOLDER FOR LEAD
Melt 1 part of block tin, and when in a state of fusion, add 2 parts of 
lead; if a small quantity of this, when melted, is poured upon the table, 
there will, if it be good, arise little bright stars upon it. Resin should 
be used with this solder.

                            141. SOLDER FOR TIN
Take 4 parts of pewter, 1 of tin, and 1 of bismuth, melt them together, 
and run them into thin slips. Resin is also employed in using this solder.

                           142. SOLDER FOR IRON
    The best solder for iron is good tough brass, with a little borax.

                          143. SOLDER FOR COPPER
Take of brass, 6 parts; zinc, 1 part; tin, 1 part; melt all together, mix 
well, and pour out to cool.

                       144. SOLDER FOR STEEL JOINTS
   Silver, 19 parts; copper, 1 part; brass, 2 parts; melt all together.

                             145. HARD SOLDER
              Fuse together 2 parts of copper, and 1 of zinc.

                          146. SOLDER FOR SILVER
           Fuse together 5 parts of silver, and 1 part of brass.







                          147. GOLD SOLDER No. 1
 Take of gold, 4 parts; silver, 3 parts; copper 1 part; and zinc, 1 part.

                          148. GOLD SOLDER No. 2
  Take of gold, 3 parts; silver, 3 parts; copper, 1 part; zinc, 1/2 part.

                          149. GOLD SOLDER No. 3
Take of gold, 2 parts; silver, 3 parts; copper, 1 part; and zinc 1/2 a 
part. The gold, silver, and copper must be fused in a crucible before the 
zinc is added, or else you cannot keep them in the vessel while heating. 
When all are completely fused, they must be well stirred, and run into 
bars. Solder No.1 is for gold 16 carats and upwards; No.2 is for that 14 
carats fine; and No.3 for lower qualities. If more zinc is added, it will 
fuse at a lower heat, but the colour is not so good.

                              150. MOCK GOLD
Fuse together 16 parts of copper, 7 of platinum, and 1 of zinc. When steel 
is alloyed with 1/500 part of platinum, or with 1/500 part of silver, it 
is rendered much harder, more malleable, and better adapted for all kinds 
of cutting instruments. Note. - In making alloys, care must be taken to 
have the more infusible metals melted first, and afterwards add the 
others.

151. BRITANNIA METAL
Take 4 parts of brass, and 4 parts of tin; when fused add 4 parts of 
metallic bismuth, and 4 parts of metallic antimony. This composition is 
added at discretion to metallic tin, according to the quality you wish to 
make.

                           152. BLANCHED COPPER
        Melt together 8 parts of copper and a half part of arsenic.

                            153. COMMON PEWTER
             Melt together 4 parts of tin and 1 part of lead.

                             154. BEST PEWTER
            Melt together 100 parts of tin and 17 of antimony.

                   155. A METAL THAT EXPANDS IN COOLING
Melt together 9 parts of lead, 2 of antimony and one of bismuth. This 
metal is very useful in filling small defects in iron castings, &c.

                            156. QUEEN'S METAL
 Melt together 9 parts of tin, 1 of antimony, 1 of bismuth, and 1 of lead

                          157. IMITATION PLATINUM
This metal, or alloy, very closely resembles platinum. Melt together 8 
parts of brass and 5 parts of zinc.






                         158. CHINESE WHITE COPPER
Melt together 40.4 parts of copper, 31.6 parts of nickel, 25.4 of zinc, 
and 2.6 of iron.

159. MANHEIM GOLD
        Melt together 3 parts copper, 1 of zinc, and a little tin.

160. TOMBACK, OR RED BRASS
           Melt together 8 parts of copper, and 1 part of zinc.

                            161. IMITATION GOLD
Take of platina 8 parts, of silver 4 parts, copper 12 parts, melt all 
together.

                           162. IMITATION SILVER
Take of block tin 100 parts, metallic antimony 8 parts, bismuth 1 part, 
and 4 parts of copper; melt all together.

                        163. TRUE IMITATION OF GOLD
Dr. Harmsteadt's imitation of gold, which is stated not only to resemble 
gold in colour, but also in specific gravity and ductility, consists of 16 
parts of platinum, 7 parts of copper, and 1 of zinc, put in a crucible, 
covered with charcoal powder, and melted into a mass.

                       164. TRUE IMITATION OF SILVER
Imitation of pure silver, so perfect in its resemblance that no chemist 
living can tell it from pure virgin silver. It was obtained from a German 
chemist now dead; he used it for unlawful purposes to the amount of 
thousands, and yet the metal is so perfect that he was never discovered. 
It is all melted together in a crucible, here it is: 1/4 oz. of copper, 2 
oz. of brass, 3 oz. of pure silver, 1 oz. of bismuth, 2 ozs. of saltpetre, 
2 ozs. of common salt, 1 oz. of arsenic, and 1 oz. of potash.

165. MOULDS AND DIES
Take copper, zinc, and silver, in equal proportions, and melt them 
together, and mould into the forms you desire, and bring the same to a 
nearly white heat; now lay on the thing that you would take the impression 
of, and press it with sufficient force, and you will find that you have a 
perfect and beautiful impression. All of the above metals should be melted 
under a coat of powdered charcoal.

                            166. TO SOFTEN HORN
To 1 lb. of wood ashes, add 2 lbs. of quicklime; put them into a quart of 
water, let the whole boil till reduced to one third, then dip a feather 
in, and if, on drawing it out, the plume should come off, it is a proof 
that it is boiled enough, if not, let it boil a little longer; when it is 
settled filter it off, and in the liquor thus strained put in shavings of 
horn; let them soak for three days, and, first anointing your hands with 
oil, work the horn into a mass, and print or mould it into any shape you 
please.








167. TO MAKE MOULDS OF HORN
If you wish to take the impression of any coin, medal, &c., previously 
anoint it with oil, then lay the horn shavings over it in its softened 
state; when dry the impression will be sunk into the horn, and this will 
serve as a mould to reproduce, either by plaster of Paris, putty and glue, 
or isinglass and ground egg shells, the exact resemblance of the coin or 
medal.
                168. TO CASE FIGURES IN IMITATION OF IVORY
Make isinglass and strong brandy into a paste, with powder of egg shells, 
very finely ground; you may give it what colour you please, but cast it 
warm into your mould, which you previously oil over; leave the figure in 
the mould till dry, and you will find, on taking it out, that it bears a 
very strong resemblance to ivory.

                           169. TRUE GOLD POWDER
Put some gold leaf, with a little honey or thick gum water, (whenever I 
speak of gum I mean gum arabic,) into an earthen mortar, and pound the 
mixture till the gold is reduced to very small particles; then wash out 
the honey or gum repeatedly with warm water, and the gold will be left 
behind in a state of powder, which, when dried, is fit for use.

                           170. TRUE GOLD POWDER
Another, and perhaps better method of preparing gold powder is to heat a 
prepared amalgam of gold in a clean open crucible, (an amalgam of any 
metal is formed by a mixture of quicksilver with that metal) continuing a 
very strong heat till all the mercury has evaporated, stirring the amalgam 
all the while with a glass rod; when the mercury has entirely left the 
gold, grind the remainder in a Wedgewood's mortar, with a little water, 
and when dried it will be fit for use. The subliming the mercury is, 
however, a process injurious to the health.

171. COLOUR HEIGHTENING COMPOSITIONS
For yellow gold, dissolve in water 6 ozs. of saltpetre, 2 ozs. of 
copperas, 1 oz. of white vitriol, and 1 oz. of alum. If wanted redder, add 
a small portion of blue vitriol.

                            172. FOR GREEN GOLD
Dissolve in water a mixture consisting of 1 1/2 oz. of saltpetre; vitriol 
and sal-ammoniac, 1 1/4 oz. of each, and 1 oz. verdigris.

                             173. FOR RED GOLD
Take 1 1/2 oz. of red ochre in fine powder, the same quantity of calcined 
verdigris, 1/2 oz. of calcined borax, and 4 oz. of melted yellow wax; the 
verdigris must be calcined, or else, by the heat applied in melting the 
wax, the vinegar becomes so concentrated as to corrode the surface, and 
make it appear speckled. These last three are colours for heightening 
compositions.








                             174. MOSAIC GOLD
Mosaic gold, or aurum mosaicum, is used for inferior articles. It is 
prepared in the following manner: 1 lb. of tin is melted in a crucible, 
and 1/2 lb. of purified quicksilver added to it; when this mixture is 
cold, it is reduced to powder, and ground with 1/2 lb. of sal ammoniac, 
and 7 ozs. of flower of sulphur, till the whole is thoroughly mixed; they 
are then calcined in a mattrass, and the sublimation of the other 
ingredients leaves the tin converted into the aurum mosaicum, which is 
found at the bottom of the glass, like a mass of bright flakey gold 
powder. Should any black or discoloured particles appear, they must be

removed. The sal-ammoniac used here must be very white and clear, and the 
mercury quite pure and unadulterated. When a shade of deeper red is 
required, it can easily be obtained by grinding a very small quantity of 
red lead along with the above materials.

                         175. DUTCH OR GERMAN GOLD
A gilding powder is sometimes made from Dutch gold, which is sold in books 
at a very low price. This is treated in the same way as the real gold leaf 
in making the true gold powder. It is necessary, when this inferior powder 
is used, to cover the gilding with a coat of clear varnish, otherwise it 
soon loses its metallic appearance. The same remark applies, though to a 
less degree, to Mosaic gilding.

                            176. COPPER POWDER
This is prepared by dissolving filings or slips of copper with nitrous 
acid in a receiver. When the acid is saturated, the slips are to be 
removed; or, if filings be employed, the solution is to be poured off from 
what remains undissolved; small bars are then put in, which will 
precipitate the copper from the saturated acid, in a powder of the 
peculiar appearance and colour of copper, and the liquid being poured from 
the powder, this is to be washed clean of the crystals by repeated 
levigations.

                             177. COMMON SIZE
The size used by painters for most sorts of common work is prepared by 
boiling in water pieces of parchment, and of the skins of animals and fins 
of fish, and evaporating the solution to a proper consistency. It only 
differs, however, from a solution of glue containing fewer foreign 
ingredients, and in not being so strong.

178. DR. JOHN'S VARNISH FOR PLASTER OF PARIS CASTS
Take of white soap and white wax, each half an ounce, of water two pints; 
boil them together for a short time in a clean vessel. This varnish is to 
be applied when cold, by means of a soft brush. It does not sink in, it 
readily dries, and its effect may be heightened by lightly using a silk 
pocket handkerchief.






                   179. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR BRONZING
This art is nothing but a species of painting, but far from being of the 
most delicate kind. The principal ingredients made use of in it are the 
true gold powder, the German gold, the aurum mosaicum, and copper powder, 
(all above described.) The choice of these powders is, of course, to be 
determined by the degree of brilliancy you wish to obtain. The powder is 
mixed with strong gum water or isinglass, and laid on with a brush or 
pencil; and when not so dry as to have still a certain clamminess, a piece 
of soft leather wrapped round the finger, is dipped in the powder and 
rubbed over the work; when the work has been all covered with the bronze, 
it must be left to dry, and any loose powder then cleared away by a hair 
pencil.

                           180. BRONZING IN WOOD
This may be effected by a process somewhat differing from the above, 
Prussian blue, patent yellow, raw amber, lamp-black, and pipe clay are 
ground separately with water on a stone, and as much of them as will make 
a good colour put into a small vessel three-fourths full of size. This 
mixture is found to succeed best on using about half as much more pipe 
clay as of any of the other ingredients. The wood being previously cleaned 
and smoothed, and coated with a mixture of clean size and lamp-black, 
receives a new coating with the above compound twice successively, having 
allowed the first to dry. Afterwards the bronze powder is to be laid on 
with a pencil, and the whole burnished or cleaned anew, observing to 
repair the parts which may be injured by this operation; next, the work 
must be coated over with a thin lather of castile soap, which will take 
off the glare of the burnishing, and afterwards be carefully rubbed with a 
woollen cloth. The superfluous powder may be rubbed off when dry.

                           181. IN BRONZING IRON
The subject should be heated to a greater degree than the hand can bear; 
and German gold, mixed with a small quantity of spirit of wine varnish, 
spread over it with a pencil; should the iron be already polished, you 
must heat it well and moisten it with a linen rag dipped in vinegar.

                  182. BRONZING CASTS OF PLASTER OF PARIS
There is a method of bronzing casts of plaster of Paris analogous to that 
which we have above given for bronzing wood, but it is not in much repute. 
Such figures may be beautifully varnished by means of Dr. John's varnish, 
receipt No.178. Casts of plaster of Paris may be made by receipt No.167.

183. SHELL-LAC VARNISH
Dissolve in an iron kettle, one part of pearl-ash in about 8 parts of 
water; add one part of shell-lac, and heat the whole to ebullition. When 
the lac is dissolved, cool the solution, and impregnate it with chlorine, 
till the lac is all precipitated. The precipitate is white, but its colour 
deepens by washing and consolidation; dissolved in alcohol, lac bleached 
by the above process yields a varnish which is as free from colour as any 
copal varnish.









 184. CHLORINE FOR SHELL-LAC VARNISH
This may be formed by mixing intimately eight parts of common salt, and 
three parts of the black oxide of manganese in powder; put this mixture 
into a retort, then pour four parts of sulphuric acid, diluted with an 
equal weight of water, and afterwards allowed to cool upon the salt and 
manganese; the gas will then be immediately liberated, and the operation 
may be quickened by a moderate heat. A tube leading from the mouth of the 
retort must be passed into the resinous solution, where the gas will be 
absorbed, and the lac precipitated.

185. SHELL-LAC VARNISHES OF VARIOUS COLOURS
These may be made by using ant colour in fine powder with the varnish, in 
the following manner: rub up the colour with a little alcohol or spirits 
of turpentine till it becomes perfectly smooth, then put it into the cup 
with the varnish. Shell-lac varnish is the best spirit varnish we have, 
and may be made any colour by the above process.

186. GOLD OIL-COLOUR, OR SIZE
The English method of preparing the colour in size, which serves as the 
ground on which the gold is laid, is, to grind together some red oxide of 
lead with the thickest drying oil that can be procured, the older the 
better. To make it work freely, it is mixed, before being used, with a 
little oil of turpentine, till it is brought to a proper consistence. The 
above four receipts are used in japanning.

                              187. JAPANNING
If it be woodwork you are about to japan, it must be prepared with size, 
and some coarse material mixed with it to fill up and harden the grain of 
the wood, (such as may best suit the colour to be laid on,) which must be 
rubbed smooth with glass paper when dry. In cases of accident, it is 
seldom necessary to resize the damaged places, unless they are 
considerable.

188. GRINDING COLOURS IN JAPANNING
Be very careful in japanning, to grind your colours smooth in spirits of 
turpentine, then add a small quantity of turpentine and spirit varnish, 
lay it carefully on with a camel hair brush, and varnish it with brown or 
white varnish, according to the colour.

189. COLOURS REQUIRED IN JAPANNING
Flake white, red lead, vermillion, lake, Prussian blue, patent yellow, 
orpiment, orchres, verditers, vandyke brown, umber, lamp-black, and 
siennas raw and burnt. With these you may match almost any colour in 
general use in japanning. For a black japan, it will be found sufficient 
to mix a little gold-size with lamp-black; this will bear a good gloss, 
without requiring to be varnished afterwards.






  190. TO PREPARE A FINE TORTOISE-SHELL JAPAN
Take 1 gallon of good linseed oil, and 1/2 lb. of umber; boil them 
together till the oil becomes very brown and thick, then strain it through 
a coarse cloth, and set it again to boil; in which state it must be 
continued till it acquires a consistence resembling that of pitch; it will 
then be fit for use.

  191. DIRECTIONS FOR USING TORTOISE-SHELL JAPAN
Having thus prepared the varnish or japan, clean well the substance which 
is to be japanned; then lay vermillion, tempered with shell-lac varnish, 
or with drying oil, very thinly diluted with oil of turpentine, on the 
places intended to imitate the more transparent parts of the 
tortoise-shell; when the vermillion is dry, brush the whole over with 
black varnish, tempered to a due consistence with the oil of turpentine. 
When set and firm, put the work into a stove, where it may undergo a
very strong heat, which must be continued a considerable time; if even 
three weeks or a month it will be the better. This tortoise-shell ground 
it not less valuable for its great hardness, and enduring to be made 
hotter than boiling water without damage, than for the superior beauty and 
brilliancy of its appearance.

    192. TO MAKE CLOTH, SILK &c., WATER-PROOF
Mix equal quantities of alum and acetate of lead, and dissolve the mixture 
in 1 1/2 gallons of boiling water. When the solution has cooled,remove the 
supernatent liquid from the sediment, which consists of sulphate of lead, 
and is ready for use. Any article of dress, when well saturated in this 
liquid, and allowed to dry slowly, bears the action of boiling water, and 
does not permit it to pass through, although steam and air penetrate if 
freely.

                           193. CROCKERY CEMENT
Dissolve 1 oz. of common salt in 1 quart of water, bring to a boil, and 
put in 1 1/4 lbs. gum shell-lac; when it shall have dissolved, pour into 
cold water, and work like wax; make into small sticks. This will make 
crockery as firm as a rock. Directions: - Warm the stick, apply it to the 
broken edges, then heat the edges, place them together and hold for a 
minute, and they are firm.

     194. A CEMENT FOR CHINA, GLASS-WARE, &c.
Take a thick mucilage of gum arabic, and stir into it plaster of Paris to 
form a thick paste, apply to the edges with a brush, and press firmly 
together and confine them two or three days, and you will be astonished at 
their firmness.

                           195. ANGLER'S SECRET
The juice of loveage or smellage mixed with any kind of bait, or a few 
drops of the oil of rhodium; India cockle, also, is sometimes mixed with 
flour dough, and sprinkled on the surface of still water. This intoxicates 
the fish, and makes him turn up on the top of the water, when he is taken 
and put in a tub of fresh water until he revives, when all is right; he 
may be eaten without fear; but this will destroy many fish.






196. MORELLA WINE
Take the juice of morella or tame cherries, and to each quart put 3 quarts 
of water, and 4 lbs. of coarse brown sugar; let them ferment, and skim 
until worked clear; then draw off, avoiding the sediment at the bottom, 
bung up, or bottle, which is best for all wines, letting the bottles lie 
always on the side, either for wines or beers.

                               197. HAIR DYE
No.1 Crystalised nitrate of silver, 1 drachm; soft water, 1 oz. 
No.2 Sulphide (sulphuret is the same) of potassium, 1 drachm; soft water, 
1 oz.; wash the beard or hair with soap to remove oil, dry with a towel a 
little then apply No.1, and directly after it No.2, for a few minutes, 
alternately, using different tooth brushes for each No. Clear days are 
best on which to apply it. As soon as dry, wash out well with soap. Keep
it from shirt bosoms and face, especially No.1, as it will make the face 
sore as well as colour it. If you do get it on the skin, cyanide (cyanuret 
is the same) of potassium, 1 drachm, to 2 ozs. of water, will take it off. 
This last is poison, however, and should not touch sore places, nor be 
left where children may get at it.

                  198. TALLOW CANDLES IN IMITATION OF WAX
Purify melted mutton tallow by throwing in powdered quicklime, then add 2 
parts of wax to 1 of tallow. A most beautiful article of candle, 
resembling wax, will be produced by the mixture. Dip the wicks in 
lime-water and saltpetre on making.

             199. TO STAIN MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS A CRIMSON STAIN
Take of ground Brazil, 1 lb.; water, 3 quarts; cochineal, 1/2 oz.; boil 
the Brazil in the water for an hour; then strain, and add the cochineal; 
then boil it gently for half-an-hour, when it will be fit for use. If you 
wish a scarlet tint, boil an ounce of saffron in a quart of water, and 
pass over the work before you stain it. The article must be very clean, 
and of firwood, or the best sycamore. When varnished over this stain it is 
most elegant.

                   200. A PURPLE STAIN FOR VIOLINS, &c.
Take of chipped logwood, 1 lb.; of water, 3 quarts; of pearl-ash, 4 ozs.; 
of indigo, pounded, 2 ozs.; put the logwood in the water, boil well for an 
hour, then add the pearl-ash and indigo, and when dissolved, you will have 
a beautiful purple.

                    201. A BLUE STAIN FOR VIOLINS, &c.
Take of oil of vitriol in a glass bottle, 1 lb.; put into it 4 ozs. of 
indigo, and precede as directed in dyeing.

                     202. GREEN STAIN FOR VIOLINS, &c.
Take of strong vinegar, 3 pints; of best verdigris, 4 ozs., ground fine; 
of sap green, 1/2 oz.; of indigo, 1/2 oz.; mix all together.








                    203. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR DYEING
The materials should be perfectly clean; soap should be rinsed out in soft 
water; the article should be entirely wetted, or it will spot; light 
colours should be steeped in brass, tin or earthen; and, if set at all, 
should be set with alum. Dark colours should be boiled in iron, and set 
with copperas; too much copperas rots the thread.

204. FOR COLOURING SKY BLUE
Get the blue composition; it may be had at the druggist's, or clothier's, 
for a shilling an ounce. If the articles are not white, the old colours 
should all be discharged by soap or a strong solution of tartaric acid, 
then rinsed; 12 or 16 drops of the composition, stirred into a quart-bowl 
of warm water, and strained if settlings are seen, will dye a great many 
articles. If you want a deeper colour, add a few drops more of the 
composition. If you wish to colour cotton goods, put in pounded chalk to 
destroy the acid, which is very destructive to all cotton; let it stand 
until the effervescence subsides, and then it may be safely used for 
cotton or silk.
     205. FOR LILAC COLOUR
Take a little pinch of archil, and put some boiling hot water upon it, add 
to it a very little lump of pear-lash. Shades may be altered by pear-lash, 
common slat, or wine.

206. TO COLOUR BLACK
Logwood and cider, boiled together in iron, water being added for the 
evaporation, makes a good durable black. Rusty nails or any bits of rusty 
iron, boiled in vinegar, with a small piece of copperas, will also dye 
black; so will ink powder, if boiled with vinegar. In all cases, black 
must be set with copperas.

       207. TO DYE LEMON COLOUR
Peach leaves, bark scraped from the barberry bush, or saffron, steeped in 
water, and set with alum, will colour a bright lemon, drop in a little 
gum-arabic to make the articles stiff.

                         208. TO DYE ROYAL PURPLE
Soak logwood chips in soft water until the strength is out, then add a 
teaspoonful of alum to a quart of the liquid; if this is not bright 
enough, add more alum, rinse and dry. When the dye is exhausted, it will 
colour a fine lilac.

       209. TO DYE SLATE COLOUR
Tea grounds, boiled in iron vessels, set with copperas, makes a good slate 
colour. To produce a light slate colour, boil white maple bark in clear 
water, with a little alum. The bark should be boiled in brass utensils. 
The goods should be boiled in it and then hu





                            210. TO DYE SCARLET
Dip the cloth in a solution of alkaline or metallic salt, then in a 
cochineal dye, and let it remain some time, and it will come out 
permanently coloured. Another method: 1/2 lb. of madder, 1/2 oz. of cream 
tartar, and 1 oz. of marine acid to 1 lb. of cloth; put it all together, 
and bring the dye to a scalding heat; put in your materials, and they will 
be coloured in ten minutes. The dye must be only scalding hot. Rinse your 
goods in cold water as soon as they come from the dye.

                      211. TO COLOUR A BRIGHT MADDER
For 1 lb. of yard or cloth, take 3 ozs. of madder; 3 ozs. of alum; 1 oz. 
of cream tartar; prepare a brass kettle with two gallons of water, and 
bring the liquor to a steady heat, then add your alum and tartar, and 
bring it to a boil; put in your cloth, and boil it two hours; take it out, 
and rinse it in cold water; empty your kettle, and fill it with as much 
water as before; then add your madder; rub it in fine in the water before 
your cloth is in. When your dye is as warm as you can bear your hand in, 
then put in your cloth, and let it lie one hour, and keep a steady heat; 
keep it in motion constantly, then bring it to a boil fifteen minutes, 
then air and rinse it. If your goods are new, use 4 ozs. of madder to a 
lb.
                           212. TO COLOUR GREEN
If you wish to colour green, have your cloth as free as possible from the 
old colour, clean, and rinsed; and, in the first place, colour it deep 
yellow. Fustic, boiled in soft water, makes the strongest and brightest 
yellow dye; but saffron, barberry-bush, peach-leaves, or onion-skins, will 
answer pretty well. Next take a bowlful of strong yellow dye, and pour in 
a great spoonful or more of the blue composition, stir it up well with a 
clean stick, and dip the articles you have already coloured yellow into 
it, and they will take a lively grass-green. This is a good plan for old 
bombazet-curtains, dessert-cloths, old flannel for desk coverings, &c.

                    213. TO DYE STRAW COLOUR AND YELLOW
Saffron, steeped in earthen and strained, colours a fine straw colour. It 
makes a delicate or deep shade, according to the strength of the tea. 
Colouring yellow is described in receipt No.212. In all these cases a 
little bit of alum does no harm, and may help to fix the colour. Ribbons, 
gauze handkerchiefs, &c., are coloured well in this way, especially if 
they be stiffened by a bit of gum-arabic, dropped in while the stuff is 
steeping.

                         214. TO DYE A DRAB COLOUR
Take plum tree sprouts, and boil them an hour or more; add copperas, 
according to the shade you wish your articles to be. White ribbons take 
very pretty in this dye.

                            215. TO DYE PURPLE
Boil an ounce of cochineal in a quart of vinegar. This will afford a 
beautiful purple.











                             216 TO DYE BROWN
Use a teaspoonful of soda to an ounce of cochineal, and a quart of soft 
water.

                            217. TO COLOUR PINK
Boil 1 lb. of cloth an hour in alum water, pound 3/4 of an oz. of 
cochineal and mix 1 oz. of cream of tartar; put in a brass kettle, with 
water, enough to cover the cloth; when about blood hot, put in your cloth, 
stir constantly, and boil about fifteen minutes.

                        218. TO DYE A COFFEE COLOUR
         Use copperas in a madder-dye, instead of madder compound.

                         219. TO DYE NANKIN COLOUR
The simplest way is to take a pailful of lye, to which put a piece of 
copperas half as big as a hen's egg; boil in a copper or tin kettle.

                         220. TO MAKE ROSE COLOUR
Balm blossoms, steeped in water, colour a pretty rose colour. This answers 
very well for the linings of children's bonnets, for ribbons, &c.

                 221. TO DYE STRAW AND CHIP BONNETS BLACK
Boil them in strong logwood liquor 3 or 4 hours, occasionally adding green 
copperas, and taking the bonnets out to cool in the air, and this must be 
continued for some hours. Let the bonnets remain in the liquor all night, 
and the next morning take them out, dry them in the air, and brush them 
with a soft brush. Lastly, rub them inside and out with a sponge moistened 
with oil, and then send them to be blocked. Hats are done in the same way.

                222. TO DYE WHITE GLOVES A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE
Boil 4 oz. of logwood, and 2 oz. of roche-alum, in 3 pints of soft water, 
till half wasted; let it stand to be cold after straining. If they be old 
gloves let them be mended; then do them over with a brush, and when dry 
repeat it. Twice is sufficient unless the colour is to be very dark; when 
dry, rub off the loose dye with a coarse cloth; beat up the white of an 
egg, and with a sponge, rub it over the leather. The dye will stain the 
hands, but wetting them with vinegar before they are washed will take it 
off.

                      223. TO BLEACH STRAW HATS, &c.
Straw hats and bonnets are bleached by putting them, previously washed in 
pure water, in a box with burning sulphur; the fumes which arise unite 
with the water on the bonnets, and the sulphurous acid, thus formed, 
bleaches them.






                          224. TO DYE SILKS BLACK
To 8 gallons of water add 4 ozs. of copperas; immerse for 1 hour and take 
out and rinse; boil 2 lbs. logwood chips, or 1/2 lb. of extract; 1/2 lb. 
of fustic; and for white silks, 1/2 lb. of nicwood; dissolve 2 lbs. of 
good bar-soap in a gallon of water; mix all the liquids together, and then 
add the soap, having just enough to cover the silk; stir briskly until a 
good lather is formed, then immerse the silk and handle it lively. The dye 
should be as warm as the hand will bear; dry quickly and without rinsing. 
The above is enough for 10 yards or one dress.

                      225. TO COLOUR YELLOW ON COTTON
Wet 6 lbs. of goods thoroughly; and to the same quantity of water add 9 
oz. of sugar of lead; and to the same quantity of water in another vessel, 
add 6 oz. of bichromate of potash; dip the goods first into the solution 
of sugar of lead, and next into that of the potash, and then again into 
the first; wring out, dry, and afterwards rinse in cold water.

                    226. FOR STAINING GLASS - No.1 FLUX
Minimum, or red lead, 3 parts; white sand, washed, 1 part. This mixture is 
melted, by which it is converted into a greenish-yellow glass

                              227. No.2 FLUX
Of No.1, 8 parts; fused borax, in powder, 1 part. This mixture is melted.

                           232. DEEP AZURE BLUE
Oxide of cobalt, 1 part; oxide of zinc, 2 parts; flux No.2, 5 parts. The 
beauty of this colour depends on the proportion of flux. As little as 
possible is to be used; it must, however, be brilliant. Sometimes less is 
used than the proportion indicated.

                               233. SKY BLUE
Oxide of cobalt, 1 part; oxide of zinc, 2 parts; flux No.2, 12 parts;

                             245. PURE PURPLE
The purple powder of Cassius mixed while moist with flux No.3, and 
sometimes a little chloride of silver previously melted with flux No.3. If 
the purple, when prepared, does not melt sufficiently easy, some flux may 
be added when it is dry.

                             246. DEEP VIOLET
The purple of Cassius, in place of flux No.3, flux No.1 is mixed with it. 
Sometimes a little of blue No.233 is added.

                              247. FLESH RED
The sulphate of iron, put in a small crucible, and lightly calcined, 
produces a suitable red oxide. Those which have the desired tone are 
selected. All the flesh reds are made in this way, and vary only in the 
degree of heat which they receive.

                              248. HAIR BROWN
Yellow ochre, No.244, 15 parts; oxide of cobalt, 1 part; well triturated 
and calcined, in order to give the tone to it.

                             249. LIVER BROWN
Oxide of iron made of a red brown, and mixed with three times its weight 
of flux No.2. A tenth of sienna earth is added to it if it is not 
sufficiently deep.

                      252. YELLOW FOR BROWNS & GREENS
Antimonic acid, 2 parts; sulphate of iron 1 part; flux No.1, 9 parts. This 
colour is melted and sometimes a little Naples Yellow is added if it is 
too soft, i.e., melts too easily.

                      253. BLUEISH GREY FOR MIXTURES
Blue previously made by melting together three parts of flux No.1, and one 
part of the mixture of oxide of cobalt, 8 parts; oxide of zinc, 1 part; 
sulphate of iron calcined at a forge heat, 1 part; flux No.2, 3 parts;

part; flux No.1, 6 parts; fused borax, 1/2 part; melt and add oxide of 
manganese, 1 part; oxide of copper, 2 parts; triturate without melting.

                          256. GENERAL DIRECTIONS
The colours thus prepared after having been rubbed up on a plate of ground 
glass with the spirits of turpentine or lavender, thickened in the air are 
applied with a hair pencil. Before using them, however, it is necessary to 
try them on small pieces of glass, and expose them to the fire, to 
ascertain if the desired tone of colour is produced. The artist must be 
guided by these proof pieces in using his colours. The proper glass for 
receiving these colours should be uniform, colourless, and difficult of 
fusion. For this reason crown glass made with a little alkali or kelp is 
preferred. A design must be drawn upon paper and placed beneath the plate 
of glass. The upper side of the glass being sponged over with gum-water 
affords, when dry, a surface proper for receiving the colours, without the 
risk of their running irregularly, as they would be apt to do on the 
slippery glass. The artist draws on the plate, with a fine pencil all the 
traces which mark the great outlines and shades of the figures. This is 
usually done in black , and afterwards, when it is dry, the vitrifying 
colours are laid on by means of larger hair pencils. The yellow formed 
with chloride of silver is generally laid on the back of the glass, for it 
is apt to run with the other colours while heating.
The pigments used in painting on glass are principally matallic oxides and 
chlorides, and as, in most of these, the colour is not brought out until 
after the painting is submitted to heat, it is necessary to ascertain 
beforehand if the colours are properly mixed by painting on slips of 
glass, and exposing them to heat in a muffle. The painter is guided by 
these trial pieces in laying on his colours. To fire the paintings a 
furnace with a muffle is used. The muffles are made of refractory clay.

                   257. WHITE COATING FOR GOLD VARNISHES
A quart of strong parchment size and half a pint of water are to be made 
quite hot, and to these are to be added, (in small portions from time to 
time,) two good handsful of common whiting, passed through a fine sieve; 
this mixture is to be left to infuse for half an hour, when it is to be 
stirred carefully so that the amalgamation may be perfect. This coating is 
preferable to any glue or cement for coating picture frames, &c., on which 
is to be laid the tin or silver foil, to be varnished with gold varnishes 
or lackers.

                              Weights, 256 lbs....... $5.01

To the above add two galls. of the incorporated oil, and 2 galls. of the 
linseed oil to thin it for use, and it will not exceed two cents and a 
quarter. The lime-water, whiting, road-dirt, and blue-black, must be first 
mixed together, then add the ground lead, first blending it with 2 1/2 
galls. of the prepared fish oil; after which, thin the whole with 2 galls. 
of linseed oil and 2 galls. of incorporated oil, and it will be fit for 
use. For garden doors, and other work liable to be in constant use, a 
little spirits of turpentine may be added to the paint whilst laying on, 
which will have the desired effect.

                          259. BRIGHT GREEN PAINT

        112 lbs. yellow ochre in powder at 5 cts. per lb.... $5.50
        168 lbs. road-dust..................................  0.25
        112 lbs. wet blue, at 20 cts. per lb................ 22.40
         10 lbs. blue-black, at 5 cts. per lb...............  0.50
          6 galls. of lime-water............................  0.06
          4 galls. fish oil, prepared.......................  2.40
          7 1/2 galls. incorporated oil.....................  4.28
          7 1/2 galls. linseed oil, at 90 cts. per gal......  6.75
                                                            --------
                              Weights, 592 lbs.............. $42.24

It will be seen that the bright green paint costs but about 7 cts. per 
lb., ready to lay on; and the inventor challenges any colour-man or 
painter to produce a green equal to it for five times the price. After 
painting, the colour left in the pot may be covered with water to prevent 
it from sinking, and the brushes, as usual, should be cleaned with the 
painting-knife, and kept under water. A brighter green may be formed by 
omitting the blue-black. A lighter green may be had by the addition of 10 
lbs. of ground white lead. Observe that the wet blue must be ground with 
the incorporated oil, preparatory to its being mixed with the mass.

                             Weights, 293 lbs.......  $9.85

The above stone-colour fit for use, is not three and a half cents per 
pound.

                       261. BROWN-RED COLOURED PAINT

                Lime-water, 8 galls.................  $0.08
                Spanish brown, 112 lbs..............   3.36
                Road-dust, 224 lbs..................   0.40
                4 galls. of fish oil................   2.40
                4 galls. incorporated oil...........   2.28

                                                     --------
                             Weights, 501 lbs....... $12.12

This paint is scarcely two and a half cents per pound. The Spanish brown 
must be in powder.

                   262. A GOOD CHOCOLATE COLOURED PAINT
This is made by the addition of blue black in powder, or lamp-black to 
receipt No.261, till the colour is to the painter's mind; and a lighter 
brown may be formed by adding ground white lead. By ground lead is meant 
white lead ground in oil.

                             263. YELLOW PAINT
This is prepared with yellow ochre in powder, to receipt No.261, in the 
same proportion as Spanish brown.

                             264. BLACK PAINT
This is also prepared in the same proportion, as in receipt No.261, using 
lamp-black or blue-black, instead of Spanish brown.








                             265. WHITE PAINT
Slack a peck of nice, clean, fresh lime in a covered vessel, with water 
which is boiling hot; when well slacked, strain it well, then add to it 1 
1/2 lbs. of finely ground rice; let the rice be boiled to a thin paste, 
and stirred in while very hot; 1/2 peck of common salt, well dissolved in 
warm water; 1/2 lb. of clean glue, dissolved in water; and 1/4 lb. of 
whiting; when well mixed, add 5 gallons of very hot water, then stir well, 
and let stand a few days well covered. Pit it on hot, and it will stand 
the weather as well as a good deal of white lead. You may colour this
paint to suit your taste, using and stirring in well Spanish brown for a 
red pink colour. Take common clay finely powdered, and mixed well with 
Spanish brown for a reddish stone-colour. For yellow colour use yellow 
ochre if you please, but chrome yellow makes a richer colour and less 
does. You may make the colours dark or light according to the quantity of 
colouring matter used.

                       266 COMPOUND COLOURED PAINTS
The various colours that may be obtained by the mixture of other colours, 
are innumerable. I only propose here to give the best and simplest modes 
of preparing those which are required for use. Compound colours, formed by 
the union of only two colours, are called by painters virgin tints. The 
smaller the number of colours of which any compound colour is composed, 
the purer and the richer it will be. They are prepared as follows:

                              267. LIGHT GREY
This is made by mixing white lead with lamp-black, using more or less of 
each material, as you wish to obtain a darker or lighter colour.

                             268. BUFF COLOUR
              This is made from yellow ochre and white lead.

                         269. SILVER OR PEARL GREY
Mix white lead, indigo, and a very light portion of black, regulating the 
quantities by the shade you wish to obtain.

                             270. FLAXEN GREY
This is obtained by a mixture of white lead and Prussian blue, with a 
small quantity of lake.

                             271. BRICK COLOUR
This is prepared by mixing yellow ochre, and red lead, with a little white 
lead.

                           272. OAK WOOD COLOUR
Mix together three-fourths white lead, and one-fourth part umber and 
yellow ochre; the proportions of the last two ingredients being determined 
by the required tints.






                          273. WALNUT TREE COLOUR
Two-thirds white lead, and one-third red ochre, yellow ochre, and umber, 
mixed according to the shade sought. If veining is required, use different 
shades of the same mixture, and for the deepest places, black.

                               274. JONQUIL
Mix together yellow, pink, and white lead. This colour is only proper for 
distemper

                             275. LEMON YELLOW
Mix together realgar and orpiment; some object to this mixture on account 
of the poisonous nature of the ingredients. The same colour can be 
obtained by mixing yellow-pink with Naples yellow; but it is then only fit 
for distemper.

                            276. ORANGE COLOUR
              For this colour mix red lead and yellow ochre.

                            277. VIOLET COLOUR
Make by mixing vermillion, or red lead, with black or blue, and a small 
portion of white: vermillion is far preferable to red lead, in mixing this 
colour.

                                278. PURPLE
                Made by mixing dark-red with violet-colour.

                             280. GOLD COLOUR
This is procured by mixing massicot, or Naples yellow, with a small 
quantity of realgar, and a very little Spanish white.

                             281. OLIVE COLOUR
This may be obtained by various mixtures: black and a little blue, mixed 
with yellow; yellow-pink, with a little verdigris and lamp-black; or ochre 
and a small quantity of white, will also produce a kind of olive colour. 
For distemper, indigo and yellow-pink, mixed with white lead or Spanish 
white, must be used. If veined, it should be done with umber.

                             282. LEAD COLOUR
              Mix together indigo and white lead or whiting.

                            283 CHESTNUT COLOUR
Mix red-ochre and black, for a dark-chestnut. To make it lighter, employ a 
mixture of yellow-ochre.

                         284. LIGHT TIMBER COLOUR
   For this colour mix together spruce-ochre, white and a little umber.

                             285. FLESH COLOUR
              Mix lake, white-lead, and a little vermillion.










                          286. LIGHT WILLOW GREEN
               This is made by mixing white with verdigris.

                             287. STONE COLOUR
                   Mix white with a little spruce-ochre.

                           288. DARK LEAD COLOUR
                 Mix black and white with a little indigo.

                             289. FAWN COLOUR
           Mix white lead, stone-ochre, and a little vermillion.

                           290. CHOCOLATE COLOUR
Mix lamp-black and Spanish brown. On account of the fatness of the 
lamp-black, mix some litharge and red lead.

                        291. PORTLAND STONE COLOUR
Mix umber, yellow ochre, and white lead. The variety of shades of brown 
that may be obtained, are nearly as numerous as those of green.
                         292. TO IMITATE MAHOGANY
Let the first coat of painting be white lead, the second orange, and the 
last burned umber or sienna; imitating the veins according to your taste 
and practice.

                         293. TO IMITATE WAINSCOAT
Let the first coat be white, the second half white and half yellow-ochre, 
and the third yellow-ochre only. Shadow with umber or sienna.

                        294. TO IMITATE SATIN WOOD
Take white for your first coating, light blue for the second, and dark 
blue or dark green for the third.

                     295. TURNER'S PATENT YELLOW PAINT
When sea-salt is made into a paste with litharge, it is decomposed, its 
acid unites with the litharge, and the soda is set free. Hence Turner's 
patent process for decomposing sea-salt, which consists in mixing two 
parts of the former with one of the latter, moistening and leaving them 
together for about twenty-four hours. The product is then washed, 
filtered, and evaporated, by which soda is obtained. A white substance is 
now left undissolved; it is a compound of muriatic acid and lead, which, 
when heated, changes its colour, and forms Turner's yellow; a very 
beautiful colour, much in use among coach-painters.





                296. TO PAINT IN IMITATION OF BLACK WALNUT
Wash the surface of the wood with weak alum-water, after being well 
sand-pappered; then go over it with linseed oil, coloured with murat amber 
and red lead. It is better to have this colour rather light, and renew the 
application; when this has sufficiently dried, go over the surface with a 
strong sizing of transparent glue, and then use two castors of copal 
varnish. Any good grained pine will bear a very close resemblance to 
walnut, and the surface will be nearly as hard.


                                   NOTE
For mixing the foregoing paints it is impossible to lay down any 
particular rule as to quantity, as each person mixes them of a shade to 
suit his own taste. They are mixed with oil and a little turpentine, and 
sometimes a little japan is added to assist in drying. When they are not 
mixed in this way the particular mode is mentioned.

                       297. RULES FOR MAKING PICKLES
Select the best vinegar, for on this will depend the quality of your 
pickles; use glass bottles or stone jars for your pickles, never use 
earthenware glazed; use wooden knives and forks in making; leave the jars 
three-fourths full of the articles to be pickled; then fill the jar or 
bottle with vinegar. If you add alum at all let it be very little; look 
your pickles over occasionally and remove any that may not be doing well. 
Small cucumbers, beans, green plums, tomatoes, onions, and radish pods, 
may be used for assorted pickles; one red pepper for forty or fifty 
cucumbers is sufficient; if the vinegar on pickles becomes white or weak, 
take it out and scald and skim it, then return it to the pickles.

                          298. ASPARAGUS PICKLED
Cut and wash the heads of the largest asparagus; place them in cold water 
for two hours; scald carefully in salt and water, then lay on a cloth 
until cool; make a pickle of salt and vinegar and boil it; to one gallon 
of pickles put a quarter of an ounce of mace, two nutmegs, a quarter of an 
ounce of whole pepper, and pour your pickle hot over them, cover tight 
with a cloth, and let stand a week, then boil the pickle, and let stand a 
week again, and boil again, when cold, cover closely.

                    299. BEANS AND FRENCH BEANS PICKLED
Lay them in salt and water for nine days; then add a little vinegar and 
boil them in the liquor; when they become green strain them, wipe them 
dry, and put the beans into the jar; boil some vinegar, ginger, mace, 
pepper, cloves, and mustard seed, all bruised, and while hot pour it on 
the beans; cover them close when cold.

                        300. TO PICKLE RED CABBAGE
Take the quarter of a purple head of cabbage, cut out the stalk, then 
slice it down endways, put them on a drying sieve, sprinkle each layer of 
cabbage with salt, which let lay and drain for two or three days, then put 
into a jar, boil some vinegar with spice tied up in a muslin bag, cut a 
beet root of good colour into slices; the branches of cauliflower cut off 
after it has lain in salt will look and be of a beautiful red; put it into 
a stone jar and pour boiling vinegar over it.









                         301. TO PICKLE CUCUMBERS
Lay them upon dishes, sprinkle salt over them, let them lie a week, drain 
then off, and put them into stone jars, pour boiling vinegar over them, 
place them near fire, cover them well with vine leaves, and if not a good 
green pour off the vinegar and boil it again; cover them with fresh vine 
leaves and continue doing so until they are a good colour; as, to make a 
better green, you must use a mettle stew pan or brass kettles, which are 
very poisonous; use wooden spoons with holes to dish all pickles, keeping 
them always well covered and free from air.

                           302. TO PICKLE ONIONS
Peel the onions till they look white, boil some strong salt and water and 
pour it over them; let them stand in this twenty-four hours; keep the 
vessel closely covered to retain the steam; after this wipe the onions 
quite dry, and when they are cold pour boiling vinegar, with ginger and 
white pepper over them; the vinegar must cover the onions.

                         303. TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS
These are pickled in salt water and brandy, but they are of little 
advantage.

                  304. RAILROAD SYSTEM OF HORSE TRAINING
This excellent and very simple method of horse training is nearly all 
accomplished by what is called the persuader or bit; which is made as 
follows: take a piece of strong rope eight or ten feet long and a quarter 
of an inch thick, then part the horse's mane in the centre, turning one 
half towards the ears, and the other towards the back of the horse; next 
tie the rope by one end in a hard knot that will not slip - not too 
tightly - round the horse's neck in the place at which the mane is 
divided, having the knot on the right side of the neck; then pass the 
loose end of the rope forwards, along the right side of the neck, into the 
horse's mouth and back along the left side of the neck to that part of the 
rope which surrounds the horse's neck, and underneath which it is passed; 
than take the loose end of the rope in your hand, and you have the 
persuader or bit completed. By pulling on the end which you now hold, you 
draw his mouth up towards his throat, and can thereby inflict the most 
excruciating torture that is possible for a horse to undergo, and the 
beauty of it is, without the least injury to the animal. One pull on this 
persuader is more dreaded by the horse than a whole day's flogging with 
raw-hide. In fact he cannot stand it; no matter how ugly his tricks may 
be, such as kicking, balking or anything else, if you use the persuader on 
him at the time, you can conquer him at once; make him as meek as a lamb, 
and glad to do anything to escape the torture inflicted by the persuader. 
A few times is all you will have to use it, even on the most sulky animal, 
until you will see no more of his tricks, and he is completely conquered.








                         305. TO HALTER WILD COLTS
How to approach and halter the wildest colt of any age without danger, and 
lead him quietly, is as follows: choose a large floor, that of a 
wagonhouse answers well, strew it over with straw two or three inches 
deep, turn your colt into it, follow him in with a good whip, shut the 
door, and he will clear to the furthest corner, follow him, and whip him 
well on the hips, he will clear to another corner, follow him, treat him 
in the same manner, and he will soon begin to turn his head towards you, 
then stop and bid him come to you, if he does not come, lay on the whip 
again, being always careful not to touch him about the head or shoulders, 
but always about the hips, in a short time he will come to you when you 
bid him, then rub his ears, nose, neck, chest, &c., and pet him all you 
can; halter and lead him about the floor; it at any time he clears from 
you, pay the whip well on his hips until he comes to you again; after a 
little use him the same way in a small yard, and after this you can do as 
you like with him in any place.

                       306. HORSES WITH TENDER EARS
How to make a horse, that is afraid of his head or ears, easy to bridle or 
halter, is as follows: - if your horse is very fractious and wild, you 
will need to treat him according to receipt No.305, first: at all events 
you will want the floor well covered with straw, then raise the left fore
leg and strap it so that your horse will stand on three legs, then tie a 
strap just above his right fore foot, and standing on the left side of the 
horse, holding the strap in your hand, chirp to him, and the moment he 
attempts to move forwards, he is on his knees; you may then fasten the 
strap to that on the left leg, or hold it in your hand, as you please; 
then after the horse gets done struggling and working, rub his nose and 
ears gently, and put the halter on and take it off repeatedly, to show him 
that it may be done without hurting him, and in a short time he will not 
mind the halter or bridle.

                    307. HOW TO CONTROL A VICIOUS HORSE
How to acquire the most perfect control over the most vicious and wildest 
horse, in a short time, without the use of drugs or charms, is by going 
according to receipts No.305 and No.306, and sometimes you may have to use 
the persuader.

                         308. TO BREAK A WILD COLT
How to break the wildest colt in a short time, so that a boy of 14 years 
old can ride or handle him in perfect safety. This is done by means of the 
persuader receipts No.305 and No.306, and if the boy is to ride him, after 
the horse is on his knees, as directed in receipt No.306, and the horse is 
tired out by struggling, then let somebody get on his back, sit there for 
a while, then move on to his shoulders, and back unto his hips, and so 
work round the horse until he does not mind it, and has no fear from it. 
When he has a few lessons like this, any lad may ride him in safety.








                     309. TO MAKE A STALLION LIE DOWN
How to make the worst stallion lie down and allow you to perform any 
surgical operation on him that you wish, without the assistance of any 
one. If the horse is very ugly, you may need to follow, first, receipt 
No.305, and perhaps, use the persuader, but it is principally done by 
receipt No.306, with this addition: when you have the horse on his knees, 
you standing on his left side, and holding the strap which is attached to 
his right fore foot in your hand, as taught in receipt No.306, then put a 
headstall on him, and to its ring on the left side of his mouth, tie 
firmly a stick about an inch and a half thick, which, let run up on the 
left side of his neck, to the top of his shoulders, then tie the strap, 
which is attached to the right foot, to this pole; now pull the horse over 
on his left side, and you have him powerless, his fore feet are drawn up, 
and on account of the pole he cannot raise his head, so that you have 
perfect control over him to do as you please.

                        310. PULLING AT THE HALTER
To break a horse from pulling at the halter. This is done by means of the 
persuader; if he pulls once on this, he will never try it again.

                            311. WILD STALLIONS
How to break the wildest stallion in a short time, so that a boy can lead 
him in perfect safety. This is done by putting the horse through a regular 
course of training, according to receipts No.305 and No.306, and the use 
of the persuader.

                             312. BALKY HORSES
How to make the worst of balky horses pull true. Whenever your horse 
balks, if you there and then, openly and publicly make use of the 
persuader, and jerk him well with it, he will be glad to go, and in a 
short time you will have to use it no more; but as long as this system is 
kept secret, and when a horse balks, you do not then use the persuader, 
you will never break the horse from balking.

                            313. SHOEING HORSES
How to make a horse stand to be shod. This is accomplished by having the 
persuader fitted on, and whenever the horse makes an attempt to be ugly, 
pull on the persuader, and he will very soon be glad to stand as quiet as 
a lamb.

                                314. "WHOA"
How to make a horse understand the word "whoa" so perfectly, that he will 
always stop when spoken to, no matter what may occur to frighten him. This 
is done by having the persuader fitted on, and whenever you sat "whoa", in 
a loud and stern tone of voice, pull on the persuader, and it is 
impossible for a horse to fear or dread anything else as much as this, he 
will stop instantly, no matter what may occur to frighten him.







                               315. THROWING
How to break a horse off the habit of throwing his rider. This is 
accomplished by means of the persuader, and receipt No.308.

                               316. SCARING
How to break a horse off scaring at umbrellas or buffalo robes, so that 
you may toss them at him without disturbing him. To accomplish this you 
want to get the horse on his knees, according to receipt No.306; then 
bring your robes and umbrellas near him, let him smell them, toss them at 
him, and throw them over his head carefully, and so continue to work, 
showing him that they do not harm him, until all fear of them is lost.

                            317. KICKING HORSES
How to break the worst class of kicking horses. To accomplish this, you 
will want to put the horse through a regular course of training, according 
to this system, until you have him well conquered; then keep the persuader 
on, and if he should ever attempt to kick, at that moment jerk well on the 
persuader, and he will think of everything but kicking; when he attempts 
it a few times, and you check him in this manner, he will quit it 
altogether.

                            318. TO BIT A HORSE
How to bit a horse more perfectly, in ten minutes, at a cost of ten cents, 
that can be done with any other bit and rig, at a cost of five to ten 
dollars. This bit is what is called the persuader, and it is the best bit 
that ever was used for bitting colts. It puts a most beautiful curve in 
the neck, and leaves the colt at ease while wearing it. When it is used 
for this purpose, the end that you hold in your hand in other cases, is 
now to be tied to that part of the persuader which surrounds the neck of 
the horse or colt.

                  319. JOCKEY TRICKS - TO PRODUCE FOUNDER
How to make a horse appear as if he was badly foundered in one night's 
time. Take a fine wire, or any substitute, and fasten it tightly round the 
castor tit, the back side of the pasture joint at night; smooth the hair 
down nicely over it, and by morning he will walk as stiff as any foundered 
horse.

                         320. FOOD AND STARVATION
How to make a horse stand by his food and starve to death. Grease the 
front teeth and roof of the mouth with common beef-tallow, and he will not 
eat until you wash it out; this, in conjunction with the above, will 
consummate a complete founder.

                               321. GLANDERS
How to make a horse appear as if he had the glanders, in one night's time. 
This is done by melting fresh butter and pouring it into his ears, not too 
hot.
















                               322. BALKING
How to make a true pulling horse balk. Take tincture of cantharides 1 oz., 
and corrosive sublimate 1 drachm; mix and bathe his shoulders at night.

                          323. TO COVER UP HEAVES
How to cover up the heaves so effectually, that you may work, ride, or run 
him, and they cannot be detected. This will last from twelve to 
twenty-four hours, long enough to trade off. Drench the horse with 
one-fourth pound of common bird shot, and he will not heave until they 
pass through him.

                           324. THE COUNTENANCE
How to put a young countenance on a horse. Make a small incision near the 
sunk place over the eye, insert the point of a blow-pipe or goose-quill, 
and blow it up; close the external wound with thread, and it is done.

                               325. THE CRIB
How to cure a horse of the crib, or sucking wind; saw between the upper 
front teeth.

                               326 QUESTIONS
To teach a horse to answer questions. This is done by pricking him with a 
pin; for instance, you may say to the horse, is your name Tom ? and at 
that moment prick him with a pin so that he will squeal; then ask him is 
your name Sam ? don't prick him and he will not squeal. Then say again is 
your name Tom, prick him again, and he will squeal; so continue, and after 
a time he will squeal without being pricked when you ask him the first 
question, &c.

                           327. TO NERVE A HORSE
How to nerve a horse that is lame. Make a small incision about half way 
from the knee to the joint on the outside of the leg, and at the back part 
of the shin bone; you will find a small white tendon or cord; cut it off 
and close the external wound with a stick, and he will walk off on the 
hardest pavement, and not lame a particle.










                            328. A HORSE'S AGE
The following rules will enable any man to ascertain with tolerable 
certainty the age of any horse. Every horse has six teeth above and six 
below; before he arrives at the age of three he sheds his two middle teeth 
by the young teeth rising and shoving the old ones out of their place. 
When he arrives at the age of three, he sheds one more on each side of the 
middle teeth; when four years old he sheds two corner and the last of his 
fore teeth; between four and five he cuts his under tusks, and when five 
will cut his upper tusks, and have a mouth full and complete, and the 
teeth will have hollows of a very dark brown colour. At six years old the 
grooves and hollows in a horse's mouth will begin to fill up a little and 
their tusks have their full growth, with their points sharp, and a little 
concave. At seven years old the grooves and hollows will be pretty well 
filled below. At eight the whole of the hollows and groves are filled up, 
and you see the appearance of what is termed smooth below. At nine years 
old, the point of the tusk is worn off, and the part that was concave 
begins to fill up and become rounded. Between nine and ten years of age a 
horse generally looses the marks of the mouth. After nine years old a 
wrinkle comes on the eyelid at the upper corner of the lower lid, and 
every year thereafter he has one well defined wrinkle for each year over 
nine. If, for instance, a horse has three wrinkles, he is twelve; if four, 
he is thirteen, &c.

                         329. HEAD, NECK OR LUNGS
How to tell by looking at a horse whether there is any thing the matter 
with his head, neck or lungs. A knowledge of this is as useful as it is 
simple. If there is nothing the matter with the head, neck or lungs of a 
horse, the nostrils will have a clean, healthy, and bright appearance, but 
if there is, they have always a dirty, muddy, or in some way an unhealthy 
appearance.

                     330. PROF. MANDIE'S HORSE TAMING
Take finely grated horse caster, or the warty excrescence from the horse's 
leg, oils of rhodium, and cumin, keep these in separate bottles well 
corked; put some of the oil of cumin on your hand and approach the horse 
on the windy side that he may smell it; he will then move towards you, 
then rub some of the cumin on his nose; give him a little of the castor on 
sugar, salt, or any thing he likes, and get 8 or 10 drops of the oil of 
rhodium on the point of his tongue; you can then get him to do any thing 
you please. Follow up your advantage by all the kindness and attention 
possible towards the animal, and your control is certain. This is only fit 
for nervous horses; but the railroad system is certain. In all kinds of 
ugly horses it is the best of methods.









                           331. BOTTS IN HORSES
This may be relied on as a certain and safe remedy for botts in horses. 
When the horse is attacked, pound some common glass very fine, sift it 
through a fine piece of muslin, take a tablespoonful, put it inside a ball 
of dough, (not mixed with the dough,) then put it down the horse's throat, 
and in from two to five minutes the horse will get up and feel and will be 
well. The moment the glass touches the botts though they may have eaten 
their way into the coats of the stomach, so that but a small portion is 
exposed, they will let go their hold, will pucker up and be driven off by 
the bowels. This remedy is perfectly safe, and is the only certain cure 
for botts under the sun. Try it.

                         332. RING BONE AND SPAVIN
Take of sweet oil, 4 oz.; spirits of turpentine, 2 ozs.; oil if stone, 1/2 
oz. Mix and apply three times a day. If the horse is over four years old, 
or in any case where there is not sufficient, in addition to it, you will 
fit a bar of lead just above it, wiring the ends together, so it 
constantly wears upon the enlargement, and the two together, will cure 
nine cases out of every ten in six weeks.

                        333. POLL EVIL AND FISTULA
Take 1 lb. common potash dissolved in 1/2 pint of water. Add 1/2 oz. 
extract of belladona and 1 oz. gum-arabic dissolved in a little water; 
work all into a paste with wheat flour, and box or bottle up tight. In 
applying this, the place should be well cleansed with soap-suds, (castile 
soap is best) then tallow should be applied all around by the paste 
dissolving and running over it. Now this paste must be pressed to the 
bottom of all the orifices; if very deep it must be made sufficiently thin 
to inject by means of a small syringe, and repeated once in two days, 
until the callous pipes, and hard fibrous base around the poll evil, or 
fistula, is completely destroyed. Sometimes one application has cured 
cases of this kind, but it will generally require two or three. If the 
horse cannot be kept up, you will put a piece of oiled cloth over the 
place. The advantage of this caustic over all others is that less pain and 
inflammation is induced. The sores may be cured by the following or 
Sloan's ointment: ceder oil is to be applied to the tendons, to prevent 
them stiffening, in pole evil, or other cases.

                  334. DeGRAY, OR SLOAN'S HORSE OINTMENT
Take of rosin 4 oz., lard 8 oz., honey 2 oz., mix and melt slowly, gently 
bring it to a boil, and as it begins to boil slowly, add a little less 
than a pint of spirits of turpentine, stirring all the time it is being 
added, then remove from the stove, and stir till cool. This is an 
extraordinary ointment for bruses in flesh or hoof, broken knees, galled 
backs, bites, cracked heels, &c. or when a hoirse is gelded, to heal and 
keep away flies.










                       335. NERVE AND BONE LINIMENT
Take of beef's gall 1 quart, alcohol 1 pint, volatile liniment 1 lb., 
spirits of turpentine 1 lb., oil of origanum 4 oz., aqua ammonia 4 oz., 
tincture of cayenne 1/2 pint, oil of amber 3 oz., tincture of spanish fly 
6 oz., mix and shake well. Uses too well known to need description.

                     336. TO CURE FOUNDERS IN 24 HOURS
Boil or steam oat straw for half an hour, then wrap it round the horses 
legs while quite hot, cover up with wet woollen rags to keep in the steam: 
in six hours renew the application. Take 1 gallon of blood from the neck 
vein, and give a quart of linseed oil. He may be worked next day.

                     337. TO CURE COLIC IN TEN MINUTES
Bleed freely at the horse's mouth, and take 1 oz. of oil of juniper, 1 oz. 
of laudanum, and 2 ozs. of sweet spirits of nitre. Mix in a pint of gruel, 
and drench him with it.

                             338. GARGLING OIL
Take of tanner's oil 1 quart, oil of vitriol 2 oz., spirits of turpentine 
1 oz. Mix all together, leave the bottles open till it stops working, then 
it is ready for use.

                       339. MERCHANT'S GARGLING OIL
Take of linseed oil 2 1/2 galls., spirits of turpentine 2 1/2 galls., 
western petroleum 1 gall., liquor potass 8 oz., sap green 1 oz., mix all 
together, and it is ready for use.

                            340. PURGING BALLS
Take of aloes, 3 oz.; anise seed, 3 oz.; pulverise and mix with castile 
soap. This makes one ball for a horse.

                             341. URINE BALLS
Take of white resin, 1/2 lb.; castile soap, 1/2 lb.; venice turpentine, 
1/2 pint; mix well together; make the balls the size of butternuts. Give 
the horse three the first day, two the second day, and one the third day.

                            342. FOR THE HEAVES
Give the horse 1/2 drachm of nitric acid, in a pint of sweet milk. Repeat 
once in two days, once in three days, and once in four days. This receipt 
is highly prized, and is good; but the best remedy for heaves is so simple 
that scarcely any one will try it; it is to take fresh sumack tops, break 
two or three bunches of them up in the horse's feed, three times a day. 
This will actually cure the heaves unless, they are very bad.









                       343 INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS
The symptoms of inflammation of the lungs in the horse is as follows: - it 
is usually ushered in by a shivering fit, the horse is cold all over, 
reaction soon takes place, the body becomes warmer, and the extremities 
extremely cold. The breathing is quick, he refuses to lie down. If when 
wearied out, he lies down, it is but for a moment.
Treatment - This may be commenced by a good bleeding, which is to be 
followed by a drachm of emetic tartar, and three drachms of nitre, every 
eight hours, rubbing the extremities, and giving bran-mashes; throw warm 
blankets over the animal, hanging down to the floor, and place vessels of 
hot water in which put hot stones or bricks, and sweat freely, also, give 
one scruple of opium, and two of calomel, twice a day. The sides of the 
chest may be thoroughly blistered. This is the proper treatment.

                          344. STOMACH AND BOWELS
Inflammation of the stomach and bowels in the horse, resembles colic in 
its symptoms, except in colic the pains pass off at times, and return 
again, whereas in inflammation, the pain is constant, and the animal is 
never easy; after a time the eye acquires a wild haggard, unnatural stare, 
and the pupil, or dark spot in the eye, dilates.
Treatment - Take away, at once, six or eight quarts of blood, and repeat 
the bleeding if the pain returns. Follow the bleeding by one scruple of 
opium, and two of calomel, twice a day; also blister the sides of the 
chest; give him bran mash and purging balls, (Receipt No. 340).

                     345. INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS
The principal symptoms of inflammation of the kidneys in the horse, is, 
pressure on the loins elicit symptoms of pain, the breathing is hurried, 
there is a constant desire to void urine, although passed in small 
quantities, highly coloured, and sometimes tinged with blood.
Treatment - This is blood letting, active purging, mustard poultices as 
near the kidneys as possible, and the horse warmly clothed, &c., as in 
other inflammations.

                          346. CONDITION POWDERS
Take of flax-seed meal 2 lbs., finygreek meal 2 lbs., liver antimony 1/2 
lb., and nitre 1/2 lb., mix well; give a tablespoon for three days and 
omit three days, &c.

                           347. FOR BONE SPAVIN
Take of cantharides 2 oz., strong mercurial ointment 4 oz., oil of 
turpentine 4 oz., iodine 3 oz., mix all with a sufficiency of lard to make 
a thin ointment; apply to the spavin only once a day until it bursts; then 
oil it with sweet oil until healed. If the bunch is not then removed, 
apply it again, and again if necessary, which is seldom the case.




                      348. TO MAKE A HORSE FOLLOW YOU
The horse is treated in the same manner as mentioned in the receipt NO. 
305, always being careful to whip him on the hips. When he will follow you 
round the barn floor, then treat him in the same manner in a yard, and 
when he follows you here, he will any place.

                        349. COLTS CHEWING HALTERS
Take scab from the wart on the inside of the leg, rub the halter 
thoroughly with it, and they will not be found chewing their halters very 
soon.

                       350 A. HORSES JUMPING FENCES
Pass a small and strong cord around his body just behind his shoulders, 
and tie the halter to this cord between his forelegs, so as to leave the 
distance about two feet from the cord to his head; if then he attempts to 
jump, he is compelled to throw his head forward, which draws hard on the 
cord, and causes it to cut into his back, and he instantly desists. The 
cord should not be more than a quarter of an inch in diameter.

                           350 B. BLAZE OR STAR
When we have a pair of horses that match well in every respect, except 
that one has a blaze or star on the face, it becomes very interesting and 
important to know how to make their faces match. Take a piece of oznaburgs 
the size you want the star or blaze; spread it with warm pitch and apply 
it to the horses face; let it remain two or three days, by which time it 
will bring off the hair clean, and make the part a little tender; then 
take of elixor vitriol a small quantity, anoint the part two or three 
times; or, take of a very common weed called asmart, a small handfull, 
bruise it, and add to it about a gill of water, use it as a wash until the 
face gets well, when the hair will grow out entirely white.

                             351. BLACK SPOTS
To spot a white horse with black spots, take litharge 3 oz., quick lime 6 
oz., beat fine and mix together; put it into a pan and pour a sharp ley 
over it; then boil it and you will have a fat substance swim on top, with 
which anoint the horse in such places as you design to have black, and it 
will turn to the colour immediately.

                        352. INFLUENZA OR HORSE-AIL
The first symptom is debility. The horse appears dumpish, refuses to eat, 
mouth hot, in six or twelve hours the appetite diminishes, legs and 
eyelids swell. This disease may end in chronic cough, a bad discharge from 
the nose, and in inveterate cases in glanders.
Treatment - Keep the horse on light food, as mashes, scalded shorts, green 
grass, &c., and if he is very plethoric, he should be half starved and 
bled from the mouth. If the throat is sore, rub it with warm vinegar and 
salt, or blister; walk him a little for exercise, administer the 
following: oil of croton, 5 drops; nitrate of potassa 4 to 6 drachms; 
potassio-tartrate of antimony, 1 drachm; spirit of nitric ether, 4 drachms 
to 1 oz; solution of acetate of ammonia 2 to 4 ozs.; and warm water 
sufficient to make a draught; and when the head is much affected, add a 
drachm of camphor. This draught may be administered once and sometimes 
twice a day, the croton oil being omitted after the first dose; after the 
first day, 2 drachms of powdered gentian may be added.







                     353. STRANGLES OR HORSE DISTEMPER
Symptoms - A discharge from the nostrils, with a swelling under the 
throat, a disinclination to eat. Thirst, but after a gulp or two the horse 
ceases to drink. In attempting to swallow, a convulsive cough comes on; 
mouth hot and tongue coated with a white fur. The tumor under the jaw soon 
fills the whole space, and is evidently one uniform body, and may thus be 
distinguished from glanders or the enlarged glands of catarrh.
Treatment - Blister over the tumor at once; when the glands remain hard 
and do not suppurate, it may lead to glanders, in which case rub it with 
iodine ointment, and give internally, hydriodate of potash in daily doses 
of 10 to 40 grains, combined with gentian and ginger. As soon as the 
swelling is fit, lance it freely and apply a linseed poultice; give bran 
mashes, fresh grass, &c.

                               354. STAGGERS
Symptoms - Giddiness, he may fall down, or suddenly turn several times 
round first; he may be quiet, or struggle violently.
Treatment - If the horse be full and well fed, take 3 or 4 quarts of blood 
at once; cease using him for a time, and give him an occasional physic 
ball or powdered aloes 6 drachms and a little in honey.

                            355. GREEN OINTMENT
Take of lard, 6 lbs., put into a ten gallon kettle; add 2 gallons of 
water; cut jimpson seeds and fill them in, and cook from 4 to 6 hours 
slowly, till all the water is gone; then put into jars, and add to each 
pound of ointment one ounce of turpentine. Good for galls, cuts, 
scratches, &c.

                   356. HOOF EVIL OR THRUSH GREASE HEELS
Bleed and physic, and poultice the feet with boiled turnips and some 
finely ground charcoal at night, for two or three nights; then wash the 
feet clean with castile soap and soft water, and apply the blue ointment 
every day; keep the horse on a floor and he will be well in 12 days.

                            357. BLUE OINTMENT
Take the ointment of rosin, 4 ozs; finely ground verdigris, 1/2 oz; 
turpentine, 2 oz; mutton tallow, 2 lbs; oil of origanum, 1/2 oz; tincture 
of iodine, 1/2 oz. Mix all together. This is one of the best medicines 
that can be made for scratches, hoof-evil, and cuts, and is good to apply 
on fistula after the rowels have been taken out. It is as good for human 
as horse flesh.

                      358. HOOF BOUND OR TENDER FEET
Never have the feet spread at the heels, nor rasped about the nail holes; 
use the liquid, and apply it according to directions. For hoof bound or 
tender feet, apply it all around the top of the hoof down one inch every 
day. First have a stiff shoe on the foot, and cleanse the cut or cork. 
Never cut or burn for it.





                             359. HOOF LIQUID
Take of linseed or neatsfoot oil, 1/2 a pint; turpentine, 4 oz; oil of 
tar, 6 oz; origanum, 3 oz; mix and shake well together.

                               360. HOOF AIL
     Apply blue vitriol, and put on a tarred rag to keep out the dirt.

                           361. BIG, OR MILK LEG
Apply the liquid blister every there hours until it blisters; then in six 
hours grease with soft oil of any kind; then in eight days wash the part 
clean, and apply it again.  Repeat it there or four times, then use the 
iodine ointment.  If this does not remove it all, apply the ringbone and 
spavin medicine, this will remove it all.

                           362. IODINE OINTMENT
Get 1oz. of the grease iodine, put in 1 pint of alcohol; let this stand in 
the sun two days, and you have the tincture of iodine. Take 2oz. of the 
tincture and 1/2lb. of lard; mix well, and you have the iodine ointment.

                         363. SPRAIN IN THE STIFLE
Symptoms - The horse holds up his foot, moans when moved, swells in the 
stifle. This is what is called stifling; there is no such thing as this 
joint getting out of place.
Treatment - Bleed two gallons, foment the stifle with hot water, rub it 
dry, then bathe it well with the general liniment every morning and night, 
give him mash, and he will soon be well. Never allow any stifle-shoe or 
cord on the foot or leg.

                          492. CANCER IN THE SKIN
No one but an impostor will presume to cure a true cancer, containing the 
cancer cell, and situated in the muscles. Many times hard tumors, not 
containing the cancer cell, are called cancers, and are removed by 
different methods, which is very easily accomplished, without a danger of 
their returning; by which means base quacks become lauded by the 
illiterate, for their superior skill in banishing this dreadful malady, 
and the orphan, and finally, in consequence thereof, plunge themselves 
headlong over yonder precipice of eternal misery. Cancer which are 
situated in the skin, and are sometimes called spider cancers, &c., may be 
cured by the following caustic: take of sulphate of iron, 1 part; and 
acetate of lead, 1 part; pulverize each separately, as fine as possible, 
and mix well together; then, by means of a probe or knitting-needle, touch 
the cancer with it every morning for three or four times, and you will be 
able to draw it all out; after which apply adhesive straps that it may 
heal. It is used in the same way to destroy corns and warts. In the case 
of cancer, physic well before applying it.

                              493. FOR WORMS

old 25 drops, four years old 30 drops, &c.

                           494. SPASMODIC CROUP
Genuine croup is indeed of very rare occurrence, and is a fearfully 
dangerous disease, the only chances are to call in a physician at once. In 
genuine croup, the child seems to have a cold and is hoarse for a few days 
previous to the attack; but the fit generally comes on suddenly in 
spasmodic croup, which may be treated as follows. During the fit put the 
child in a warm bath, apply hot water to the throat, allow fresh air, and 
sprinkle the face and chest with cold water.

                            495. FOR FLATULENCY

teaspoonful of carbonate of soda dissolved in half a tumbler full of 
sweetened water.

                              498. ERYSIPELAS

paint the inflamed part over with white lead, mixed with paint oil, it is 
an excellent remedy.





                              499. FOR FELON
Poultice well with flaxseed meal until matter begins to form, then at once 
have it well laid open with a lance, continue the poultice for some time 
afterwards.

                           500. HAIR RESTORATIVE
Take of black mustard seed 1/2 oz., red pepper 15 grains, blood root 1/2 
oz., cantharides 15 grains, castile soap 1/2 oz., alcohol one quart; mix 
all together in a bottle, let stand for a week, occasionally shaking. 
Perfume with oil of bergamot, and apply three or four times a day.

                 501. TO KILL RATS AND MICE WITHOUT POISON
Slice up a quantity of corks, grease, and scent them with oil of anise; 
throw them in the way of the rats and mice; they will eat, but cannot 
digest them; the result is they will die.

                              502. EYE WATER
One part of good brandy, to six of clean rain or distilled water, makes an 
admirable eye water for most cases of sore eyes.

                   503. FOR CHRONIC GOUT AND RHEUMATISM
Take of bicarbonate of potash 1/2 drachm, tincture of orange 2 drachms, 
compound decoction of aloes 8 oz., mix. Dose, a wine glass full whenever 
the fit is expected. This is Sir A. Cooper's prescription.

                      504. FOR SICKNESS AND VOMITING
Take of creosote 16 drops, acetic acid 16 drops, compound spirit of 
juniper 1 oz., syrup 1 oz., water 14 oz.; mix the creosote with the acid, 
add gradually the water, and lastly the syrup and spirit. Dose from two to 
four tablespoonsful.

                            505. LAXATIVE PILL
Take of powdered aloes 1 drachm, gamboge 10 grains, Castile soap and water 
sufficient to make a pill mass; mix and divide into 34 pills. Dose, one 
two, or three, to be given when necessary, for torpid bowels.

                             506. FOR HEADACHE
In case of a severe attack of headache the best remedy is, generally, to 
take a good strong physic of salts and senna. If this does not relieve it, 
or where the person is very frequently troubled with headache, apply a 
blister to the back of the neck, you will find it an excellent remedy.

                        507. ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS
The antidotes for poisoning with the strong mineral acids, such as nitric, 
muriatic, sulphuric, or oxalic acids are magnesia, chalk, whiting, in milk 
or water; mucilaginous or soapy liquids. When sulphuric acid has been 
taken, use very little water if any. Irritate the throat with a feather to 
produce vomiting.
The antidote for poisoning with corrosive sublimate or any other 
preparation of mercury, is albumen, as whites of eggs, in large quantity, 
flour and water, and milk. The whites of eggs are best.








The antidotes for poisoning by opium, or any of its preparations, as 
morphia, laudanum, &c., are the stomach pump if it can be had; emetic of 
tartar emetic, 2 to 5 grains, or sulphate of zinc, 15 to 30 grains, or 
sulphate of copper, 12 to 15 grs., for an adult. The sulphates of zinc or 
copper are best, because they act quicker. External excitation, keep in 
motion, mechanical excitement of respiration, cold effusion to the head 
and face, feet in hot water, electro-magnetism, internal stimulants, as 
bicarbonate of ammonia, 5 to 25 grains in water, carbonate of ammonia, 5 
to 15 grains, in water, coffee and vegetable acids. Some propose as an 
antidote for every case of poisoning, half a pint of bland oil, as sweet 
oil, fresh butter melted to oil, &c., to be drank at once, for an adult.

                        508. TREATMENT OF DROWNING
If respiration has ceased when the body is taken out of the water, it 
should instantly be commenced artificially, by putting a pipe into one 
nostril, and closing the mouth and the other nostril, and very gently 
blowing through it about 15 times in a minute; but it is a better plan to 
use a small pair of bellows, putting its muzzle into the nostril, at the 
same time the body should be wiped dry, and be assiduously rubbed with hot 
cloths; hot bricks and bottles of hot water should be put into the armpit, 
between the thighs, and to the feet; the head should be raised, the 
nostrils irritated with a feather, or the fumes of hartshorn, and a warm 
injection of turpentine, made as follows, may be thrown up - oil of 
turpentine, 3 drachms; gruel, 1/2 pint; and the yolk of 1 egg. Incorporate 
the turpentine with the egg, then add the gruel. Galvanism should be 
resorted to, if respiration is not quickly restored. As soon as the 
patient can swallow, he should have some weak wine and water; and soon 
afterwards an emetic of a large tablespoonful of mustard, mixed with 6 
ozs. of water, to clear the stomach of the water which he has swallowed, 
and to restore the circulation by the impetus of vomiting. After some 
hours he will suffer from severe headache and fever, which must be 
relieved by bleeding, purgatives, &c., which will be attended to by a 
physician, who will be present by this time. A case is related in which 
life was restored by the most persevering friction, which was kept up for 
eight hours before the humanity of the surgeon, Dr. Douglass, of Havre, 
was rewarded by a return of respiration.

                    509. GOOD SAMARITAN OR PAIN-KILLER
Take of 95 percent alcohol 2 quarts, and add to it the following articles: 
oils of sarsafras and hemlock, spirits of turpentine, balsam of fir, 
chloriform, tincture of catechu and guaiacum, of each 1 oz., oil of 
origanum 2 oz., oil of wintergreen 1/2 oz., and gum of camphor, 1/2 oz. 
Let it all be well incorporated and you have the most excellent pain 
killer that was ever made. It is good for rheumatism, headache, neuralgia, 
cuts, sprains, burns, bruises, spinal affections, ear-ache, tooth-ache, 
sore throat, &c. This is used internally and externally, the dose 
internally is 10 drops; take on sugar.

                          511. THE WAY TO WEALTH
  "The way to wealth," says Doctor Franklin, "is as plain as the way to 
market." Many men, however, either miss the way, or stumble and fall on 
the road.
  Fortune, they say, is a fickle dame - full of her freaks and caprices; 
who blindly distributes her favors without the slightest discrimination. 
So inconsistant, so wavering is she represented, that her most faithfull 
votaries can place no reliance on her promises.
  Disappointment, they tell us, is the lot of those who make offerings to 
her shrine. Now, all this is a vile slander upon the dear blind lady.
  Although wealth often appears the result of mere accident, or a 
fortunate concurrence of favourable circumstances, without any exertion of 
skill or foresight, yet every man of sound health and unimpaired mind may 
become wealthy, if he takes the proper steps.
  Foremost in the list of requisites, are honesty and strict integrity in 
every transaction of life. Let a man have the reputation of being fair and 
upright in his dealings, and he will possess the confidence of all who 
know him.
  Without these qualities, every other merit will prove unavailing. Ask 
concerning a man, "Is he active and capable ?"  Yes.  "industrious, 
temperate, and regular in his habits ?"  O Yes.  "Is he honest ? is he 
trustworthy ?"  Why, as to that, I am sorry to say that he is not to be 
trusted; he wants watching; he is a little tricky, and will take an undue 
advantage, if he can. "Then I will have nothing to do with him:" will be 
the invariable reply.
  Next, let us consider the advantages of a cautious circumstances in our 
intercourse with the world. Slowness of belief, and a proper distrust are 
essential to success.
  The credulous and confiding are ever the dupes of knaves and imposters. 
Ask those who have lost their property how it happened, and you will find 
in most cases it has been owing to misplaced confidence.






  One has lost be endorsing; another by crediting; another by false 
representatives; all of which a little more foresight and a little more 
distrust would have prevented. In the affairs of this world, men are not 
saved by faith, but by the want of it. Judge men by what they do, not by 
what they say. Believe in looks rather than in words.
  Before trusting a man, before putting it in his power to cause you a 
loss, posses yourself of every available information relative to him. 
Learn his history, his habits, inclinations and propensities; his 
reputation for honesty, industry, frugality, and punctuality; his 
prospects, resources, supports, advantages and disadvantages; his 
intentions and motives of action; who are his friends and enemies, and 
what are his good and bad qualities.
  You may learn a man's good qualities and advantages from his friends - 
his bad qualities and disadvantages from his enemies. Make due allowance 
for exaggeration in both.
  Finally, examine carefully before engaging in anything, and act with 
energy afterward. Have the hundred eyes of Argus beforehand, and the 
hundred hands of Briarius afterward.

             512. MAXIMS BY DR. FRANKLIN ON THE WAY TO WEALTH
    - God helps those who help themselves.
    - Many words won't fill a bushel.
    - Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labour wears.
    - The key often used is always bright.
    - Dost thou love life ? Then do not squander time, for that is the
      stuff life is made of.
    - The sleeping fox catches no poultry.
    - There will be time enough for sleep, in the grave.
    - If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be
      the greatest prodigality.
    - Lost time is never found again.
    - What we call time enough, always proves little enough.
    - Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry all easy.
    - He that riseth late must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake
      his business at night.
    - Laziness travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes him.
    - Drive thy business, lest it drive thee.
    - Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and
      wise.
    - Industry need not wish.
    - He that lives upon hope, will die fasting.
    - There are no gains without pains.
    - Help, hands, for I have no lands.
    - He that hath a trade, hath an estate, and he that hath a calling,
      hath an office of profit and honour; but the trade must be worked
      at, and the calling well followed, or neither will enable us to pay
      our taxes.
    - The drone in the hive makes no honey.
    - At the working mans house hunger looks in, but does not enter.
    - Industry pays debts, but despair increaseth them.
    - Diligence is the mother of good luck.






    - God gives all things to industry.
    - Plough deep while sluggards sleep, and you will have corn to sell
      and to keep.
    - One today is worth two tomorrow.
    - Have you somewhat to do tomorrow, do it today.
    - If you were a servant, would you not be ashamed that a good master
      should catch you idle ?  Are you, then, your own master ? be ashamed
      to catch yourself idle.
    - The cat in gloves catches no mice.
    - Light strokes fell great oaks.
    - By diligence and patience, the mouse ate into the cable.
    - Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure; and since
      thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour.
    - A life of leisure and a life of laziness, are two things.
    - Troubles spring from idleness, and grievous toils from needless
      ease.
    - Many would live by their wits, without labour, but they break for
      want of stock.
    - Industry gives comfort, plenty, and respect.
    - Now I have a sheep, and a cow, everybody bids me good-morrow.
    - I never saw an oft removed family, Nor yet an oft removed family,
      That throve so well as one that settled thee.
    - Three removes are as bad as a fire.
    - Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.
    - If you would have your business done, go; if not, send.
    - He that by the plough would thrive, himself must either hold or
      drive.
    - The eye of the master will do more work than both his hands.
    - Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge.
    - Not to oversee workmen, is to leave them your purse open.
    - In the affairs of the world, men are saved not by faith, but for
      the want of it.
    - Learning is to the studious, and riches to the careful, as well as
      power to the bold, and heaven to the virtuous.
    - If you would have a faithful servant, and one that you like,
      serve yourself.
    - A little neglect may breed great mischief.
    -             For want of a nail the shoe was lost;
                  For want of a shoe the horse was lost;
                  For want of a horse the rider was lost -
                  Being overtaken and slain by the enemy.
    - If a man save not as he gets, he may keep his nose to the grindstone
      all his life, and die not worth a groat.
    - A fat kitchen makes a lean will.
    - Many estates are spent in the getting, since women for tea, forsook
      spinning and knitting, and men for punch, forsook hewing and
      splitting.
    - The Indians did not make Spain rich, because her out-goes were
      greater than he incomes.









    - What maintains one vice would bring up two children.
    - Many a little makes a mickle.
    - Beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship.
    - Who dainties love, shall beggars prove.
    - Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.
    - Buy what thou dost not need, and ere long thou shalt sell thy
      necessaries.
    - At a great bargain pause awhile.
    - It is foolish to lay out money in the purchase of repentance.
    - Wise men learn by another's harms, fools scarcely by their own.
    - Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, put out the kitchen fire.
    - A ploughman on his legs, is higher than a gentleman on his knees.
    - Always taking out of the meal tub, and never putting in, soon
      comes to the bottom.
    - When the well is dry we know the worth of water.
    - If you would know the value of money, try to borrow.
    - Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse.
    - Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.
    - Pride is a loud a beggar as want, and a great deal more saucy.
    - Vessels large may venture more, but little boats should keep the
      shore.
    - Pride that shines on vanity sups on contempt.
    - Pride breakfasted with plenty, dined with poverty, and supped with
      infamy.
    - The second vice is lying; the first is running in debt.
    - Lying rides upon debt's back.
    - It is hard for an empty bag to stand upright.
    - Creditors have better memories than debtors.
    - Creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set days
      and times.
    - The borrower is a slave to the lender, and the debtor to the
      creditor.
    - Experience keeps a dear school; but fools will learn in no other
      and scarce in that; for we may give advice, but we cannot give
      conduct.
    - They that will not be counselled cannot be helped.
    - Distrust and caution are the parents of security.
    - There is neither honour nor gain got in dealing with a villain.
    - Light purse, heavy heart.
    - Ne'er take a wife till thou hast a house (and a fire) to put her in.
    - Great talkers, little doers.
    - Relation without friendship, friendship without power, power without
      will, will without effect, effect without profit, and profit without
      virtue, are not worth a farthing.
    - He has changed his one-eyed horse for a blind one.









                    TO ALL WHO HAVE PURCHASED THIS WORK
                    -----------------------------------

  You are now in possession of about all the latest and most useful 
receipts that are in the country; many of which are now being sold, 
frequently, for from $5 to $10 and $20 each; and if you will now be wise, 
do that which will be to your own interest, allow no man to see this work, 
but keep the receipts profoundly secret, except as you sell them. You may 
dispose of enough of them, written off, every year you have the book, to 
amount to twenty times the price of it.

   There you have it. A most remarkable collection of "receipts", just as 
the man advertised.  We hope you get as much enjoyment out of this work as 
we have had over the one hundred and twenty five years it has been in our 
family.
