This file will help you understand the basic's of hacking onto HP 3000.

And remember that you use this on your own risk and we shall not be hold 
responsible for any missuse of the information, which are supplied for
educational use only.

Hewlett Packard series 3000 computers have a good defence against hacking 
if you don't know so much about the computer.

First of all when you get connected to a HP3000 computer, press <Return> until
you get a ':' which indicates that you have established a contact with the
remote computer. Now the computer waits for you to sign on, and you do that 
with; HELLO Username.Aaccount or HELLO username.Account,Group

The group that usually exists are the PUB group in every account.
One user and account that must exist are MANAGER.SYS. You could try hacking
the password for this user, but every wrong password will notify the system 
operator about your misstakes.

Another way are to try out some of Hewlett Packard standard accounts and
password. Try the following

HELLO MGR.TELESUP          Account password:HPONLY    User password:MGR
HELLO FIELD.SUPPORT        Account password:<None>    User password:<None>

also try HELLO OPERATOR.SYS, sometimes they don't have a password here.

Well, if you manage to logon to the computer and just have limited
capabilites, you may easy raise your privs and/or look for other
accounts and user. Try RUN LISTDIR5.PUB.SYS, it might also be LISTDIR2 
depending on the version of MPE operating system.
Here you can type LISTACCT @;PASS and if you have the right capabilities
you will have all accounts listed with capabilites and password.
Also type LISTUSER @.@;PASS and here you will get information about
all users on the system.

Some userful feature under MPE are that you can type HELP and get full
description over all MPE commands.

Well exit LISTDIR5 if it didn't do you any good, and try this one instead.
LISTF @.PUB.SYS,2
This command will show the directory of the system group on system account,
where all files are accessible through any user.
Check all files that have FA under type.. ie.
NIGHTJOB         128W FA    1024   1024   .....
                      ^^

To view the file type:
FCOPY FROM=filename.PUB.SYS;TO=
and sometimes it is a batchjob laying there and you can identify it with that
the first line looks something like this
!JOB NIGHTJOB,user/passwrd.account/password;OUTCLASS=LP
and just try these out and see if they work.

If you run a program and it's requesting a password, you can also use FCOPY
on the program file as well and see if you can locate the password.
Usually it will be displayed without beeing encrypted.

Well. one more thing... to logoff just type BYE
and thats for me to, until next time.... 


Part two will soon be released covering more standard accounts and
small programs that will help you raise your capabilities.
