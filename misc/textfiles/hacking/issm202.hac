Hacker Lists Passwords Hackers Look For  
Choosing the Right Password!  
  
Imagine a hacker entering a system with your id and password  
because you did not take the time to choose a good password,  this 
is something that can be completely prevented if people would take 
a few minutes to choose a good password.  You must be creative when 
choosing a password not lazy.  Since a password is usually the  
first line of defense against unauthorized access to a computer  
system, when the first line is broken the rest only take time.  The 
average user usually has a password that is easy to select and easy 
to remember.  Any word that is easy to select or is contained in 
a dictionary is a poor and insecure selection for a password.  The 
reason this makes a poor selection is because these words are the 
first ones an intruder will try when attempting to compromise your 
system.  For instance, if your name is Tom Smith and your logon id 
is TSMITH your password should not contain any variation of these 
two words (Tom & Smith).  A hacker will try TSMITH, SMITHT, 
TOMSMITH, SMITHTOM, TSMITH1, HTIMST, etc. before anything else.  
As far as the length of a password goes its definitely the longer 
the better.  To demonstrate this point I give you the following 
table:  
  
# of        Possible             Average Time   
Characters  Combinations         To Discover     Example  
  
1            36                   6 min           q  
2            1,300                4 hrs           bt  
3            47,000               5 days          tyu  
4            1,700,000            6 months        insw  
5            60,000,000           19 years        potnb  
etc...  
  
The greater the number of possibilities a hacker must sort through, 
the better the chances of a password remaining undiscovered.  
  
The best passwords are those that contain a combination of letters  
and numbers or are a combination of two or more unrelated words  
i.e. TREEFLOOR, TVBOOK, RADIOSHOE, etc.  Another possibility is to  
select the initials of your two grandmothers combined with the  
number of times you have seen your favorite movie to come up with  
a password that resembles PAWH07, 07WHPA, PA07WH, etc.    
  
If you think that you have chosen a password that is hard to guess  
or would take too much time to guess keep in mind that hackers have 
automated the process.  There have been programs written for the  
sole purpose of guessing passwords, they take a list similar to the 
one in this article and try each and every one of them  
These are the types of passwords that are hard to guess and will  
most likely not be found in any dictionary or word list.  I am  
enclosing a list of common passwords that most hackers have a  
variation of, under no circumstances should you ever use a word  
contained in this list.  All forms of profanity should also be 
included in this list.100

Dear Clyde,   
What is the proper way to dispose of diskettes which are no longer 
able to be used? Are there security concerns here?  
                       Peggy  
Dear Peggy,   
Yes there are security concerns as the data stored on the diskettes 
may still be readable, if someone wants to take the effort to 
retrieve it. Therefore the diskettes should be disposed of 
properly. Any method of destroying the diskette can be used. 
Cutting it up as you do a credit card that is no longer to be used 
is one method. However the important thing is to make certain the 
disk surface, that is the inner contents of the envelope or plastic 
case, is destroyed.  
  
(Note: I personally prefer giving the disk several good whacks with 
my sword and lance to render it unusable.)   
  
  
Clyde ....... Sir Clyde?  
Rumor has it that Clyde is to be recognized for his continuing 
efforts in the arena of computer security by being knighted. There 
will be more on this in the next issue, stay tuned.

             A Response by: Dispater   
             Editor in Chief of Phrack Inc. Magazine   
             InterNet: phracksub@stormking.com   
   
First of all, I would like to thank Kim Clancy for providing me 
with the opportunity to reply to her article in the previous issue 
of the ISSM.  I find myself agreeing with her on more issues than 
not.  I read her piece on Cyberspace... Most of the article was 
good, but I felt unclear about what she was saying in the section 
titled "The Dark Side."  So I have attempted to present a few 
things from this hacker's viewpoint and make a few points where I 
have disagreed with her.  The ">" indicates Kim's previous 
writings.   
   
>...What is scary to me in regard to some of the avenues is   
>the ability for individuals to get to so many different   
>types of information...   
   
What scares me are the kinds of people who have access to   
the most personal parts of our lives compiled into data   
bases (like Information America) that are for sale to anyone   
who wants to pay the money or has the "power" to access it.   
Why does the government need to know my unlisted phone number?  Is 
it really any insurance agency's right to know that I have a son 
or daughter that is about to turn age 16, and will soon need to buy 
auto insurance?  I think I have the right not to be bothered by an 
onslaught of people that think they have something I want to 
purchase from them. If you really enjoy junk mail and computerized 
telephone sales calls you can thank these kinds of databases.   
   
>I am not stating that I think information should be   
>shielded from individuals.   
   
The more diverse sources of information we can all access, the 
better off society will become.  If we look at the past we can see 
how accuracy in books was improved drastically by the creation of 
the printing press.  The scribes of kings and church figures were 
no longer relied upon as authorities of various subject matter.  
Information was made cheap and easily possessed by the common man.  
Therefore if someone disagreed with some book that was printed, he 
and his guild could write their version of what THEY found to be 
true.  This promoted truth, accuracy, a deluge of human 
interaction, and free thought.   
   
>...I once went to a presentation about hackers.  The   
>presenter told a story about a mother who took her child's   
>computer modem out into the driveway and ran over it after   
>her son had been arrested for hacking...   
   
What was the parent doing while her child was hacking?   
Another thing we need to clarify is the use of the word   
"child."  These are not often children.  There is a certain   
level of mental development that must occur first.  I don't   
know much about child psychology, but I'd say that most kids   
under the age of 13 would have a bit of difficult time   
understanding computer networking.  Most people in the   
computer underground are at least 16.  If they are not   
16 years old almost every sysop I know, kicks them off the   
system.  The young person should be allowed to explore in areas the  
parent might not agree with as long as he/she is willing to   
talk about it with the parent afterward. Why are required to   
water down and censor all information so that is safe and   
easily understandable to the "little children?"  If there is   
a 12 year old that has network access and is reading USENET's 
ALT.SEX.BONDAGE, I think there is a greater problem involved than 
the type of information the nets carry!!   
   
>While hackers spend time developing their skills and   
>learning how to master cyberspace they also use cyberspace   
>to share information about what they have learned.   
 
This is the great benefit of getting involved.  Everyone   
should own a computer because of this reason.   
   
>Information has been found on how to steal long distance   
>phone calls from the phone company, how to make a pipe bomb   
>and how to perform satanic rituals before sitting down to   
>hack.   
   
It is not illegal to know how to do any of the previously   
mentioned things.  As you mention later the information can   
also be found in such places like libraries.  We need to   
keep a few things in perspective here.  MOST of the   
information readily available on phone phreaking is so out   
dated, one couldn't hope to implement the use of such   
knowledge without most surely getting caught in an ESS(Electronic  
Switching System environment.  Most of the United State's 
telephones are on such a system.   
   
Secondly, most of the information available on explosives is   
very crude.  Most of it isn't worth the time it took to   
download.  Actually there is more information available in   
the library on that subject than in all the data bases in   
the world.  I personally think this kind of thing is simply   
stupid.  I will not print that kind of thing in Phrack.   
That kind of information is typed in from books, by people   
who don't have anything else to do.   
 
In regards to "satanic rituals", it is difficult to make any   
comments about this because in all my years of calling BBS's   
and talking to other hackers, I have never seen such an   
animal.  I have seen *THREE* articles on the Wiccan religion   
which is similar to white witchcraft, but it's not even   
close to anything satanic.  However, other than this   
minuscule tidbit in cyberspace, the only things I've seen   
were things that were written as pranks and for joke   
purposes.  It amazes me that if one person has written   
something or done something it is representative of the   
whole community.  This is definitely not a responsible   
conclusion.  If some people would just open their eyes to   
reality, they would not see a computer underground filled   
with "satanic, child molesting anarchists".   
  
>I hesitate to write the above because I don't want people   
>to avoid the technology.  Everything I have found is in   
>most libraries, but the accessibility of it through   
>computers makes it much easier to obtain.   
   
You hesitate with good reason and you are correct about all   
that information being already in your local library.  The   
problem boils down to "digital censorship."  Some people are   
saying it's OK for a library to have the aforementioned   
information, but it's NOT OK for it to be on my computer's   
hard drive.   
   
In regards to that argument I say it is much easier to get   
the information from a library than the computer.  Let's   
take a look at they facts. First of all, most libraries are   
FREE.  On the other hand the average computer system   
(386/33) costs around $1500.  Your typical 8th grader   
doesn't usually have that kind of cash.   
   
The problem is that reality and virtual reality is the same   
for some of us.  We will promptly ignore silly rules like   
"it's ok for some people to know certain things, but it's   
not ok for me to know the same bit of information."   
In the information age we are all becoming much more aware   
of each other's presence.  We are finding out that we are   
all very different.  We each have some ideas that can   
easily shock others.  These ideas can and are being   
challenged by the other people we interact with.  Therefore,   
we should NEVER take the step back into the "electronic dark   
age."   
   
The really funny thing about all this is, everyone in the   
United States IS a part of cyberspace, even though most of   
them don't want to recognize this fact.  If your name is on   
a computer somewhere, you are in cyberspace!  So you'd   
better become aware of your existence.  Use it to learn and   
question why its there!

OAIS Employees Volunteer to Judge Student Contest  
  
Every October, the Computer Learning Foundation, a non-profit 
educational foundation serving the United States and Canada, hosts 
Computer Learning Month. During that month, among other numerous 
activities, the foundation hosts numerous contests designed to 
encourage students, educators, and community members to explore new 
areas of using technology and to share their knowledge with others. 
These contests for students provide parents and teachers with an 
activity children can do today to begin thinking and learning about 
what it means to be a responsible user of technology. One of this 
year's contests was a student writing contest focusing on Adult 
Attitudes on the Value of Technology and Ethical Issues. Students 
were to interview one parent and one other adult, write a summary 
of their opinions on the value of technology in our lives and the 
ethical issues involved with using technology, then the students 
evaluated what they thought of the comments and opinions expressed 
by the adults they interviewed.   
  The Bureau of the Public Debt participated in this program with 
several OAIS employees, Gretchen Bergmann, Kim Clancy, Bill Dobson, 
Zephery Ellerson, Joe Kordella, Gary Smith, and Ed Alesius, 
volunteering their time to judge the students entries.  
  While the use of a computer was not required to create the 
critique many submissions showed an adept usage of various word 
processing, desktop publishing and graphics software.  
  This interchange between the professional environment and schools 
proved to be very enlightening.  It is refreshing to see a group 
dedicate its effort to a much needed task, keeping schools up with 
technology and its responsible use.

Comptroller General Decision on EDI   
  
The Comptroller General of the United States has issued a decision 
that electronic data interchange (EDI) technologies, with 
enhancements such as message authentication and digital signatures, 
can create valid legal contractual obligations between the U.S. 
Government and the party with whom the agency contracts.  

Digest
   Contracts formed using Electronic Data Interchange technologies may
constitute valid obligations of the government for purposes of 31 U.S.C.
1501, so long as the technology used provides the same degree of
assurance and certainty as traditional "paper and ink" methods of
contract formation.

Decision
   By letter dated September 13, 1991, the Director, Computer Systems
Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), asked
whether federal agencies can use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
technologies, such as message authentication codes and digital
signatures, to create valid contractual obligations that can be recorded
consistent with 31 U.S.C.  1501.  For the reasons stated below, we
conclude that agencies can create valid obligations using properly
secured EDI systems.
 
Background  
  EDI is the electronic exchange of business information between 
parties, usually via a computer, using an agreed upon format.  EDI 
is being used to transmit shipping notices, invoices, bid requests, bid 
quotes and other messages.  Electronic contracting is the use of 
EDI technologies to create contractual obligations.  EDI allows the 
parties to examine the contract, usually on video monitors, but 
sometimes on paper facsimiles, store it electronically (for example on
magnetic tapes, on discs or in special memory chips), and recall 
it from storage to review it on video monitors, reproduce it on paper or
even mail it via electronic means.  Using EDI technologies, it is
possible for an agency to contract in a fraction of the time that
traditional practices take. 
  As NIST pointed out in its request, the "paperless" nature of the
technology has raised the question of whether electronic contracts
constitute obligations which may be recorded against the government. 
NIST is in the process of developing standards for electronic signatures
to be used in various applications,*1 including the formation of
contracts, but has been advised that section 1501 imposes a barrier to
the use of electronic technologies by federal agencies in this regard.

Discussion
   Section 1501 establishes the criteria for recording obligations
against the government.  The statute provides, in pertinent part, as
follows:
       "(a) An amount shall be recorded as an obligation of the United
        States Government only when supported by documentary evidence of-

             (1) a binding agreement between an agency and another person
             (including an agency) that is--

                  (A) in writing, in a way and form, and for a purpose
                  authorized by law. . . ."

31 U.S.C. 1501(a) (1) (A).

   Under this provision, two requirements must be satisfied:  first, the
agreement must bind both the agency and the party with whom the agency
contracts; second, the agreement must be in writing.

Binding Agreement
   The primary purpose of section 1501 (a) (1) is "to require that there
be an offer and an acceptance imposing liability on both parties."  39
Comp. Gen. 829, 831 (1960) (emphasis in original).  Hence the government
may record an obligation under section 1501 only upon evidence that both
parties to the contract willfully express the intent to be bound.  As
explained below, EDI technology provides both the agency and the
contractor the means to electronically "sign" a contract.
   A signature traditionally has provided such evidence.  See generally
65 Comp. Gen. 806, 810 (1986).  Because of its uniqueness, the
handwritten signature is probably the most universally accepted evidence
of an agreement to be bound by the terms of a contract.  See 65 Comp.
Gen. at 810.  Courts, however, have demonstrated a willingness to accept
other notations, not necessarily written by hand.  See, e.g., Ohl & Co.
v. Smith Iron Works, 288 U.S. 170, 176 (1932) (initials); Zacharie v.
Franklin, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 151, 161-62 (1838) (a mark);Benedict v.
Lebowitz, 346 F. 2d 120 (2nd Cir. 1965) (typed name); Tabas v. Emergency
Fleet Corporation, 9 F.2d 648, 649 (E.D. Penn. 1926) (typed, printed or
stamped signatures); Berryman v. Childs, 98 Neb. 450, 153 N.W. 486, 488
(1915) (a real estate brokerage used personalized listing contracts which
had the names of its brokers printed on the bottom of the contract in the
space where a handwritten signature usually appears).
   As early as 1951, we recognized that a signature does not have to be
handwritten and that "any symbol adopted as one's signature when affixed
with his knowledge and consent is a binding and legal signature.  B-
104590, Sept. 12, 1951.  Under this theory, we approved the use of
various signature machines ranging from rubber stamps to electronic
encryption devices.  See 33 Comp. Gen. 297 (1954); B-216035, Sept. 20,
1984.  For example, we held that a certifying officer may adopt and use
an electronic symbol generated by an electronic encryption device to sign
vouchers certifying payments.  B-216035, supra.  The electronic symbol
proposed for use by certifying officers, we concluded, embodied all of
the attributes of a valid, acceptable signature:  it was unique to the
certifying officer, capable of verification, and under his sole control
such that one might presume from its use that the certifying officer,
just as if he had written his name in his own hand, intended to be bound.
  EDI technology offers other evidence of an intent to be bound with the
same attributes as a handwritten signature.  We conclude that EDI systems
using message authentication codes which follow NIST's Computer Data
Authentication Standard (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
113*2 or digital signatures following NIST's Digital Signature Standard,
as currently proposed, can produce a form of evidence that is acceptable
under section 1501.
   Both the message authentication code and the digital signature are
designed to ensure the authenticity of the data transmitted.  They
consist of a series of characters that are cryptographically linked to
the message being transmitted and correspond to no other message.  There
are various ways in which a message authentication code or digital
signature might be generated.  For example, either could be generated
when the sender inserts something known as a "smart card"*3 into a system
and inputs the data he wants to transmit.  Encoded on a circuit chip
located on the smart card is the sender's private key.  The sender's
private key is a sequence of numbers or characters which identifies the
sender, and is constant regardless of the transmission.  The message
authentication code and the digital signature are functions of the
sender's private key and the data just loaded into the system.  The two
differ primarily in the cryptographic methodology used in their
generation and verification.
   After loading his data into the system, the sender notifies the system
that he wants to "sign" his transmission.  Systems using message
authentication codes send a copy of the data to the chip on the smart
card; the chip then generates the message authentication code by applying
a mathematical procedure known a cryptographic algorithm.  Systems using
digital signatures will send a condensed version of the data to the smart
card, which generates the digital signature by applying another
algorithm, as identified in NIST's proposed standard.  The card returns
the just-generated message authentication code or digital signature to
the system, which will transmit it and the data to the recipient.
   Under either approach, when an offeror or a contracting officer
notifies the system that he wants to "sign" a contract being transmitted,
he is initiating the procedure for generating a message authentication
code or digital signature with the intention of binding his company or 
agency, respectively, to the terms of the contract.*4 The code or the
digital signature evidences that intention, as would a handwritten or
other form of signature.  Both, generated using the sender's private key,
are unique to the sender; and, the sender controls access to and use of
his "smart card," where his key is stored.
   They are also verifiable.  When the recipient receives the contract,
either on his computer monitor or in paper facsimile, it will carry,
depending on which approach is used, a notation which constitutes the
message authentication code or the digital signature of the sender,
necessary information to validate the code or the signature and, usually,
the sender's name.  The recipient can confirm the authenticity of the
contract by entering the data that he just received and asking his system
to verify the code or the digital signature.  The system will then use
the information provided by the sender and either verify or reject it.*5
Both approaches use a key to verify the message just received; however,
the digital signature requires application of a different key from that
used to verify a message authentication code.  The change of any data
included in the message as transmitted will result in an unpredictable
change to the message authentication code or the digital signature. 
Therefore, when they are verified, the recipient is virtually certain to
detect any alteration.

Writing
   To constitute a valid obligation under section 1501(a)(1)(A), a
contract must be supported by documentary evidence "in writing."  As NIST
pointed out, some have questioned whether EDI, because of the paperless
nature of the technology, fulfills this requirement.  We conclude that it
does.
   Prior to the enactment of section 1501, originally section 1311 of the
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1955, *6 there was no "clean cut
definition of obligations."  H.R. Rep. No. 2266, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess. 50
(1954).  Some agencies had recorded questionable obligations, including
obligations based on oral contracts, in order to avoid withdrawal and
reversion of appropriated funds.  See 51 Comp. Gen. 631, 633 (1972). 
Section 1501 was enacted not to restrict agencies to paper and ink in the
formation of contracts, but because, as one court noted, "Congress was
concerned that the executive might avoid spending restrictions by
asserting oral contracts."  United States v. American Renaissance Lines,
494 F.2d 1059, 1062 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert, denied, 419 U.S. 1020 (1974). 
The purpose of section 1501 was to require that agencies submit evidence
that affords a high degree of certainty and lessens the possibility of
abuse.  See H.R. Rep. No. 2266 at 50.
   While "paper and ink" offers a substantial degree of integrity, it is
not the only such evidence.  Some courts, applying commercial law (and
the Uniform Commercial Code in particular), have recognized audio tape
recordings, for example, as sufficient to create contracts.  See e.g.,
Ellis Canning Company v. Bernstein, 348 F. Supp. 1212 (D. Colo. 1972). 
The court, citing a Colorado statute, stated that the tape recording of
the terms of a contract is acceptable because it is a "reduction to
tangible form." *7  Id. at 1228.  In a subsequent case, a federal Court
of Appeals held that an audio tape recording of an agreement between the
Gainesville City Commission and a real estate developer was sufficient to
bind the Commission.  Londono v. City of Gainesville, 768 F.2d 1223 (11th
Cir. 1985).  The court held that the tape recording constituted a "signed
writing."  Id. at 1228.
   In our opinion, EDI technology, which allows the contract terms to be
examined in human readable form, as on a monitor, stored on electronic
media, recalled from storage and reviewed in human readable form, has an
integrity that is greater than an audio tape recording and equal to that
of a paper and ink contract.  Just as with paper and ink, EDI technology
provides a recitation of the precise terms of the contract and avoids the
risk of error inherent in oral testimony which is based on human
memory.*8  Indeed, courts, under an implied-in-fact contract theory, have
enforced contracts on far less documentation than would be available for
electronic contracts.  See Clark v. United States, 95 U.S. 539 (1877). 
See also Narva Harris Construction Corp. v. United States, 574 F.2d 508
(Ct. Cl. 1978).
   For the purpose of interpreting federal statutes, "writing" is defined
to include "printing and typewriting and reproductions of visual symbols
by photographing, multigraphing, mimeographing, manifolding, or
otherwise."  1 U.S.C. 1 (emphasis added).  Although the terms of
contracts formed using EDI are stored in a different manner than those of
paper and ink contracts, they ultimately take the form of visual symbols. 
We believe that it is sensible to interpret federal law in a manner to
accommodate technological advancements unless the law by its own terms
expressly precludes such an interpretation, or sound policy reasons exist
to do otherwise.  It is evident that EDI technology had not been
conceived nor, probably, was even anticipated at the times section 1501
and the statutory definition of "writing" were enacted.  Nevertheless, we
conclude that, given the legislative history of section 1501 and the

Dear Sir:

As you know, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
cooperated with the Department of Treasury and the General Accounting
Office to develop an electronic certification system wherein a
cryptographic Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used in place of a
written signature to bind a certifying officer to a payment order. 
Several other agencies have expressed their interest in using this or a
similar system as a substitute for a written signature.  In fulfillment
of our responsibilities under the Computer Security Act of 1987, NIST is
now in the process of developing a public key based Digital Signature
Standard (DSS) which is specifically designed for electronic signature
applications and will provide at least the same degree of security as the
MAC approach.  We have attached the DSS Federal Register Announcement and
draft DSS which is now issued for public comment.

We have often been told that legal impairments exist which prevent
agencies from implementing electronic signatures to bind the federal
government.  The specific statute cited is 31 U.S.C. 1501.  Before
formally recommending these standards for contracting and financial
management applications, I would like to request a General Accounting
Office decision as to whether NIST standards such as Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 113 and a finalized DSS may be used throughout
the federal government to record obligations under 31 U.S.C. 1501.  If
you need any further information in order to make your decision please
feel free to contact Miles Smid, (301) 975-2938, of my staff.

Sincerely,

James H. Burrows
Director, Computer Systems Laboratory

Enclosures
    
*1 The Congress has mandated that NIST (formally the National Bureau of
Standards) establish minimum acceptable practices for the security and
privacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems.  Computer
Security Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-235, section 2, 101 Stat. 1724
(1988).

*2 FIPS 113 adopts American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard
X9.9 for message authentication.  It outlines the criteria for the
cryptographic authentication of electronically transmitted data and for
the detection of inadvertent and/or intentional modifications of the
data.  By adopting the ANSI standard, FIPS 113 encourages private sector
applications of cryptographic authentication; the same standard is being
adopted by many financial institutions for authenticating financial
transactions.

*3 A smart card is the size of a credit card.  It contains one or more
integrated circuit chips which function as a computer.

*4 NIST officials advise us that technology using message authentication
codes and digital signatures will be available to both contractors and
contracting officers for use in government contracting.

*5 For the sake of simplicity, this example does not describe the
complicated system of controls used to ensure that (1) no human knows the
sender's private key and (2) the information received from the sender for
validating the message authentication code or digital signature is
correct and accurate.

*6 Pub. L. No. 663, 68 Stat. 800, 830 (1954).

*7 Other courts, interpreting the laws of other states, have held that a
tape recording is not acceptable.  See Sonders v. Roosevelt, 102 A.D.2d
701, 476 N.Y.S.2d 331 (1984); Roos v. Aloi, 127 Misc.2d 864, 487 N.Y.S.2d
637 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1985).

*8 Of course, just as with any contract or other official document, an
agency must take appropriate steps to ensure the security of the
document, for example, to prevent fraudulent modification of the terms. 
Agencies should refer to NIST standards in this regard.  See, e.g., FIPS
113 (regarding message authentication codes).  In addition, agencies
should refer to the GSA regulations regarding the maintenance of
electronic records, see 41 C.F.R. 201-45.2, and to the Federal Rules of
Evidence with regard to managing electronic records to ensure
admissibility, see generally Department of Justice Report, "Admissibility
of Electronically Filed Federal Records as Evidence," Systems Policy
Staff, Justice Management Division (October 1990).

Security Hall of Fame Established  
 
Clyde's Computer Security Hall of Fame is being established to 
recognize those who contribute above and beyond the normal call of 
duty in their performance of contributing to the advancement and 
enhancement of Public Debt's computer security program.  
  The first inductee to this much sought honor is Bob Settles. Bob 
came to Public Debt immediately upon his graduation from college 
in 1964. Apart from a two year stint in Vietnam, his first 18 years 
were spent with the Internal Audit Staff. Then, in 1982, he was 
selected to manage the AIS Security Branch and has served in that 
capacity ever since. During his tenure as manager, the Branch's 
responsibilities have grown steadily to keep pace with the emphasis 
placed on information systems security throughout the Government. 
Public Debt's security program is now among the most highly 
regarded in the Treasury Department.  
  Bob has recently accepted a Computer Specialist position with the 
Treasury Department at its main office in Washington, D.C.  
  Bob epitomized the best in seasoned management and his departure 
will be keenly felt. We wish him the best in his new position!

What's New?  
 
ISSM's gain recognition in international publication  
The Public Debt Computer Security Program and the ISSM's received 
international recognition when an article written by Kim Clancy and 
Joe Kordella was published in ISPNews in the Jan/Feb 1992 edition.  
The article presented the role computer security plays in the 
protection of critical information assets of Public Debt in an 
environment of rapid technological change.  It stressed that the 
ISSM's are key players in the implementation of the security 
program.  
  
New Security Branch Manager Selected  
The selection of Kim Clancy as the Security Branch Manager 
completes the consolidation of the Branch in Parkersburg.  Kim was 
previously a security analyst in the AIS Security Branch.  Prior 
to that, she was a computer security analyst for the State of 
Arizona, for over three years.  She was also a computer systems 
security officer in the United States Air Force.

The AIS Security Branch runs an Electronic BBS. Give us a call at  
(304) 420-6083.  An electronic version of the ISSM is posted on the 
board and can be downloaded.  Articles in the electronic version 
may include more detail in that we are not limited by space 
constraints as we are in the paper copy.    
 
The ISSM is a quarterly publication of the Department of Treasury,
