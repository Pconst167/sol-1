ATTENTION:  All who enjoy the 60% discount on night and weekend calls with
            AT&T...abandon all hope.

     AT&T has declared malicious WAR on all consumers by reducing the 60%
night and weekend discount to only %45.  This change will take effect on
November 2, 1990.  This is UNSATISFACTORY!  AT&T plans to further increase
2!Q*dP.@residential consumers while simultaneously continuing to DECREASE
rates for large businesses who should be carrying the burden of the cost of
running the phone system.  After all, big businesses make up the bulk of all
long distance phone calls.  AT&T is kicking it's consumers in the balls and
laughing in their faces.

     This can not stand.  We, as hackers, can quite possibly make a
difference, or if not, at least scratch the surface and start a movement.  It
is time for us to return fire.  We accept this declaration of war!  All
hackers must unite to fortify our cause.  We must cause AT&T all the trouble
and turmoil we can muster up.  We must hamper AT&T's service to a point where
it becomes noticeable.  Make AT&T calling cards the codes of choice.  Abuse
them to hell!  Pass them out to everyone you know!  Our friends in Europe
really need AT&T calling cards.  Let's extend to them a friendly hand of
peace with an AT&T calling card in every palm.  Make every effort to disrupt
the system.  Get into their network switches and run rampant throughout,
destroying what you can, and leave a message demanding lower rates.  We will
NOT foot the bill for big businesses!  If anything, they owe US!!  Cause
uncertainty and doubt among AT&T customers!  Make the0$@ Yr whether it is
prudent to trust AT&T service and prices.  Spread rumors around about AT&T
that will make one's skin crawl.  We will not remain silent and simply accept
this injustice!  We must FIGHT BACK!

     Even if you use codes, you still pay for some phone service, and that
phone service may be next on the price increase list.  We must make a
statement now that existing phone service rates are already too high and must
be lowered or else.  DO NOT RELENT!  We hackers will prevail!
