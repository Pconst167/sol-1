Introduction: The State of the Hack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   After surveying a rather large g-file collection, my attention was drawn to
the fact that there hasn't been a good introductory file written for absolute
beginners since back when Mark Tabas was cranking them out (and almost
*everyone* was a beginner!)  The Arts of Hacking and Phreaking have changed
radically since that time, and as the 90's approach, the hack/phreak community
has recovered from the Summer '87 busts (just like it recovered from the Fall
'85 busts, and like it will always recover from attempts to shut it down), and
the progressive media (from Reality Hackers magazine to William Gibson and
Bruce Sterling's cyberpunk fables of hackerdom) is starting to take notice
of us for the first time in recent years in a positive light.
   Unfortunately, it has also gotten more dangerous since the early 80's.
Phone cops have more resources, more awareness, and more intelligence that they
exhibited in the past.  It is becoming more and more difficult to survive as
a hacker long enough to become skilled in the art.  To this end this file
is dedicated .  If it can help someone get started, and help them survive
to discover new systems and new information, it will have served it's purpose,
and served as a partial repayment to all the people who helped me out when I
was a beginner.

Part One: The Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    As long as there have been computers, there have been hackers.  In the 50's
at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT), students devoted much time
and energy to ingenious exploration of the computers.  Rules and the law were
disregarded in their pursuit for the 'hack'.  Just as they were enthralled with
their pursuit of information, so are we.  The thrill of the hack is not in
breaking the law, it's in the pursuit and capture of knowledge.
    To this end, let me contribute my suggestions for guidelines to follow to
ensure that not only you stay out of trouble, but you pursue your craft without
damaging the computers you hack into or the companies who own them.
I.    Do not intentionally damage *any* system.
II.   Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure your
      escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses, Altering
      Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for as long as
      possible.)
III.  Do not leave your (or anyone else's) real name, real handle, or real
      phone number on any system that you access illegally.  They *can* and
      will track you down from your handle!
IV.   Be careful who you share information with.  Feds are getting trickier.
      Generally, if you don't know their voice phone number, name, and
      occupation or haven't spoken with them voice on non-info trading
      conversations, be wary.
V.    Do not leave your real phone number to anyone you don't know.  This
      includes logging on boards, no matter how k-rad they seem.  If you
      don't know the sysop, leave a note telling some trustworthy people
      that will validate you.
VI.   Do not hack government computers.  Yes, there are government systems
      that are safe to hack, but they are few and far between.  And the
      government has inifitely more time and resources to track you down than
      a company who has to make a profit and justify expenses.
VII.  Don't use codes unless there is *NO* way around it (you don't have a
      local telenet or tymnet outdial and can't connect to anything 800...)
      You use codes long enough, you will get caught.  Period.
VIII. Don't be afraid to be paranoid.  Remember, you *are* breaking the law.
      It doesn't hurt to store everything encrypted on your hard disk, or
      keep your notes buried in the backyard or in the trunk of your car.
      You may feel a little funny, but you'll feel a lot funnier when you
      when you meet Bruno, your transvestite cellmate who axed his family to
      death.
IX.   Watch what you post on boards.  Most of the really great hackers in the
      country post *nothing* about the system they're currently working
      except in the broadest sense (I'm working on a UNIX, or a COSMOS, or
      something generic.  Not "I'm hacking into General Electric's Voice Mail
      System" or something inane and revealing like that.)
X.    Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's what more experienced hackers
      are for.  Don't expect *everything* you ask to be answered, though.
      There are some things (LMOS, for instance) that a begining hacker
      shouldn't mess with.  You'll either get caught, or screw it up for
      others, or both.
XI.   Finally, you have to actually hack.  You can hang out on boards all you
      want, and you can read all the text files in the world, but until you
      actually start doing it, you'll never know what it's all about.  There's
      no thrill quite the same as getting into your first system (well, ok,
      I can think of a couple of bigger thrills, but you get the picture.)
   One of the safest places to start your hacking career is on a computer
system belonging to a college.  University computers have notoriously lax
security, and are more used to hackers, as every college computer depart-
ment has one or two, so are less likely to press charges if you should
be detected.  But the odds of them detecting you and having the personel to
committ to tracking you down are slim as long as you aren't destructive.
   If you are already a college student, this is ideal, as you can legally
explore your computer system to your heart's desire, then go out and look
for similar systems that you can penetrate with confidence, as you're already
familar with them.
   So if you just want to get your feet wet, call your local college.  Many of
them will provide accounts for local residents at a nominal (under $20) charge.
   Finally, if you get caught, stay quiet until you get a lawyer.  Don't vol-
unteer any information, no matter what kind of 'deals' they offer you.
Nothing is binding unless you make the deal through your lawyer, so you might
as well shut up and wait.
Part Two: Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The best place to begin hacking (other than a college) is on one of the
bigger networks such as Telenet.  Why?  First, there is a wide variety of
computers to choose from, from small Micro-Vaxen to huge Crays.  Second, the
networks are fairly well documented.  It's easier to find someone who can help
you with a problem off of Telenet than it is to find assistance concerning your
local college computer or high school machine.  Third, the networks are safer.
Because of the enormous number of calls that are fielded every day by the big
networks, it is not financially practical to keep track of where every call and
connection are made from.  It is also very easy to disguise your location using
the network, which makes your hobby much more secure.
   Telenet has more computers hooked to it than any other system in the world
once you consider that from Telenet you have access to Tymnet, ItaPAC, JANET,
DATAPAC, SBDN, PandaNet, THEnet, and a whole host of other networks, all of
which you can connect to from your terminal.
   The first step that you need to take is to identify your local dialup port.
This is done by dialing 1-800-424-9494 (1200 7E1) and connecting.  It will
spout some garbage at you and then you'll get a prompt saying 'TERMINAL='.
This is your terminal type.  If you have vt100 emulation, type it in now.  Or
just hit return and it will default to dumb terminal mode.
   You'll now get a prompt that looks like a @.  From here, type @c mail <cr>
and then it will ask for a Username.  Enter 'phones' for the username. When it
asks for a password, enter 'phones' again.  From this point, it is menu
driven.  Use this to locate your local dialup, and call it back locally.  If
you don't have a local dialup, then use whatever means you wish to connect to
one long distance (more on this later.)
   When you call your local dialup, you will once again go through the
TERMINAL= stuff, and once again you'll be presented with a @.  This prompt lets
you know you are connected to a Telenet PAD.  PAD stands for either Packet
Assembler/Disassembler (if you talk to an engineer), or Public Access Device
(if you talk to Telenet's marketing people.)  The first description is more
correct.
   Telenet works by taking the data you enter in on the PAD you dialed into,
bundling it into a 128 byte chunk (normally... this can be changed), and then
transmitting it at speeds ranging from 9600 to 19,200 baud to another PAD, who
then takes the data and hands it down to whatever computer or system it's
connected to.  Basically, the PAD allows two computers that have different baud
rates or communication protocols to communicate with each other over a long
distance.  Sometimes you'll notice a time lag in the remote machines response.
This is called PAD Delay, and is to be expected when you're sending data
through several different links.
   What do you do with this PAD?  You use it to connect to remote computer
systems by typing 'C' for connect and then the Network User Address (NUA) of
the system you want to go to.
   An NUA takes the form of   031103130002520
                              \___/\___/\___/

   There are two ways to find interesting addresses to connect to.  The first
and easiest way is to obtain a copy of the LOD/H Telenet Directory from the
LOD/H Technical Journal #4 or 2600 Magazine.  Jester Sluggo also put out a good
list of non-US addresses in Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue 21.  These files will
tell you the NUA, whether it will accept collect calls or not, what type of
computer system it is (if known) and who it belongs to (also if known.)
   The second method of locating interesting addresses is to scan for them
manually.  On Telenet, you do not have to enter the 03110 DNIC to connect to a
Telenet host.  So if you saw that 031104120006140 had a VAX on it you wanted to
look at, you could type @c 412 614 (0's can be ignored most of the time.)
   If this node allows collect billed connections, it will say 412 614
CONNECTED and then you'll possibly get an identifying header or just a
Username: prompt.  If it doesn't allow collect connections, it will give you a
message such as 412 614 REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION with some error codes out to
the right, and return you to the @ prompt.
   There are two primary ways to get around the REFUSED COLLECT message.  The
first is to use a Network User Id (NUI) to connect.  An NUI is a username/pw
combination that acts like a charge account on Telenet.  To collect to node
412 614 with NUI junk4248, password 525332, I'd type the following:
@c 412 614,junk4248,525332  <---- the 525332 will *not* be echoed to the
screen.  The problem with NUI's is that they're hard to come by unless you're
a good social engineer with a thorough knowledge of Telenet (in which case
you probably aren't reading this section), or you have someone who can
provide you with them.
   The second way to connect is to use a private PAD, either through an X.25
PAD or through something like Netlink off of a Prime computer (more on these
two below.)
   The prefix in a Telenet NUA oftentimes (not always) refers to the phone Area
Code that the computer is located in (i.e. 713 xxx would be a computer in
Houston, Texas.)  If there's a particular area you're interested in, (say,
New York City 914), you could begin by typing @c 914 001 <cr>.  If it connects,
you make a note of it and go on to 914 002.  You do this until you've found
some interesting systems to play with.
   Not all systems are on a simple xxx yyy address.  Some go out to four or
five digits (914 2354), and some have decimal or numeric extensions
(422 121A = 422 121.01).  You have to play with them, and you never know what
you're going to find.  To fully scan out a prefix would take ten million
attempts per prefix.  For example, if I want to scan 512 completely, I'd have
to start with 512 00000.00 and go through 512 00000.99, then increment the
address by 1 and try 512 00001.00 through 512 00001.99.  A lot of scanning.
There are plenty of neat computers to play with in a 3-digit scan, however,
so don't go berserk with the extensions.
   Sometimes you'll attempt to connect and it will just be sitting there after
one or two minutes.  In this case, you want to abort the connect attempt by
sending a hard break (this varies with different term programs, on Procomm,
it's ALT-B), and then when you get the @ prompt back, type 'D' for disconnect.
   If you connect to a computer and wish to disconnect, you can type <cr> @
<cr> and you it should say TELENET and then give you the @ prompt.  From there,
type D to disconnect or CONT to re-connect and continue your session
uninterrupted.
Outdials, Network Servers, and PADs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   In addition to computers, an NUA may connect you to several other things.
One of the most useful is the outdial.  An outdial is nothing more than a modem
you can get to over telenet- similar to the PC Pursuit concept, except that
these don't have passwords on them most of the time.
   When you connect, you will get a message like 'Hayes 1200 baud outdial,
Detroit, MI', or 'VEN-TEL 212 Modem', or possibly 'Session 1234 established
on Modem 5588'.  The best way to figure out the commands on these is to
type ? or H or HELP- this will get you all the information that you need to
use one.
   Safety tip here- when you are hacking *any* system through a phone dialup,
always use an outdial or a diverter, especially if it is a local phone number
to you.  More people get popped hacking on local computers than you can
imagine, Intra-LATA calls are the easiest things in the world to trace inexp-
ensively.
   Another nice trick you can do with an outdial is use the redial or macro
function that many of them have.  First thing you do when you connect is to
invoke the 'Redial Last Number' facility.  This will dial the last number used,
which will be the one the person using it before you typed.  Write down the
number, as no one would be calling a number without a computer on it.  This
is a good way to find new systems to hack.  Also, on a VENTEL modem, type 'D'
for Display and it will display the five numbers stored as macros in the
modem's memory.
   There are also different types of servers for remote Local Area Networks
(LAN) that have many machine all over the office or the nation connected to
them.  I'll discuss identifying these later in the computer ID section.
   And finally, you may connect to something that says 'X.25 Communication
PAD' and then some more stuff, followed by a new @ prompt.  This is a PAD
just like the one you are on, except that all attempted connections are billed
to the PAD, allowing you to connect to those nodes who earlier refused collect
connections.
   This also has the added bonus of confusing where you are connecting from.
When a packet is transmitted from PAD to PAD, it contains a header that has
the location you're calling from.  For instance, when you first connected
to Telenet, it might have said 212 44A CONNECTED if you called from the 212
area code.  This means you were calling PAD number 44A in the 212 area.
That 21244A will be sent out in the header of all packets leaving the PAD.
   Once you connect to a private PAD, however, all the packets going out
from *it* will have it's address on them, not yours.  This can be a valuable
buffer between yourself and detection.
Phone Scanning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Finally, there's the time-honored method of computer hunting that was made
famous among the non-hacker crowd by that Oh-So-Technically-Accurate movie
Wargames.  You pick a three digit phone prefix in your area and dial every
number from 0000 --> 9999 in that prefix, making a note of all the carriers
you find.  There is software available to do this for nearly every computer
in the world, so you don't have to do it by hand.
Part Three: I've Found a Computer, Now What?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This next section is applicable universally.  It doesn't matter how you
found this computer, it could be through a network, or it could be from
carrier scanning your High School's phone prefix, you've got this prompt
this prompt, what the hell is it?
   I'm *NOT* going to attempt to tell you what to do once you're inside of
any of these operating systems.  Each one is worth several G-files in its
own right.  I'm going to tell you how to identify and recognize certain
OpSystems, how to approach hacking into them, and how to deal with something
that you've never seen before and have know idea what it is.
VMS-       The VAX computer is made by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),
           and runs the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system.
           VMS is characterized by the 'Username:' prompt.  It will not tell
           you if you've entered a valid username or not, and will disconnect
           you after three bad login attempts.  It also keeps track of all
           failed login attempts and informs the owner of the account next time
           s/he logs in how many bad login attempts were made on the account.
           It is one of the most secure operating systems around from the
           outside, but once you're in there are many things that you can do
           to circumvent system security.  The VAX also has the best set of
           help files in the world.  Just type HELP and read to your heart's
           content.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:  [username: password [[,password]] ]
           SYSTEM:     OPERATOR or MANAGER or SYSTEM or SYSLIB
           OPERATOR:   OPERATOR
           SYSTEST:    UETP
           SYSMAINT:   SYSMAINT or SERVICE or DIGITAL
           FIELD:      FIELD or SERVICE
           GUEST:      GUEST or unpassworded
           DEMO:       DEMO  or unpassworded
           DECNET:     DECNET
DEC-10-    An earlier line of DEC computer equipment, running the TOPS-10
           operating system.  These machines are recognized by their
           '.' prompt.  The DEC-10/20 series are remarkably hacker-friendly,
           allowing you to enter several important commands without ever
           logging into the system.  Accounts are in the format [xxx,yyy] where
           xxx and yyy are integers.  You can get a listing of the accounts and
           the process names of everyone on the system before logging in with
           the command .systat (for SYstem STATus).  If you seen an account
           that reads [234,1001]   BOB JONES, it might be wise to try BOB or
           JONES or both for a password on this account.  To login, you type
           .login xxx,yyy  and then type the password when prompted for it.
           The system will allow you unlimited tries at an account, and does
           not keep records of bad login attempts.  It will also inform you
           if the UIC you're trying (UIC = User Identification Code, 1,2 for
           example) is bad.

UNIX-      There are dozens of different machines out there that run UNIX.
           While some might argue it isn't the best operating system in the
           world, it is certainly the most widely used.  A UNIX system will
           usually have a prompt like 'login:' in lower case.  UNIX also
           will give you unlimited shots at logging in (in most cases), and
           there is usually no log kept of bad attempts.
           Common Accounts/Defaults: (note that some systems are case
           sensitive, so use lower case as a general rule.  Also, many times
           the accounts will be unpassworded, you'll just drop right in!)

Prime-     Prime computer company's mainframe running the Primos operating
           system.  The are easy to spot, as the greet you with
           'Primecon 18.23.05' or the like, depending on the version of the
           operating system you run into.  There will usually be no prompt
           offered, it will just look like it's sitting there.  At this point,
           type 'login <username>'.  If it is a pre-18.00.00 version of Primos,
           you can hit a bunch of ^C's for the password and you'll drop in.
           Unfortunately, most people are running versions 19+.  Primos also
           comes with a good set of help files.  One of the most useful
           features of a Prime on Telenet is a facility called NETLINK.  Once
           you're inside, type NETLINK and follow the help files.  This allows
           you to connect to NUA's all over the world using the 'nc' command.
           For example, to connect to NUA 026245890040004, you would type
           @nc :26245890040004 at the netlink prompt.

HP-x000-   This system is made by Hewlett-Packard.  It is characterized by the
           ':' prompt.  The HP has one of the more complicated login sequences
           around- you type 'HELLO SESSION NAME,USERNAME,ACCOUNTNAME,GROUP'.
           Fortunately, some of these fields can be left blank in many cases.
           Since any and all of these fields can be passworded, this is not
           the easiest system to get into, except for the fact that there are
           usually some unpassworded accounts around.  In general, if the
           defaults don't work, you'll have to brute force it using the
           common password list (see below.)  The HP-x000 runs the MPE operat-
           ing system, the prompt for it will be a ':', just like the logon
           prompt.

IRIS-      IRIS stands for Interactive Real Time Information System.  It orig-
           inally ran on PDP-11's, but now runs on many other minis.  You can
           spot an IRIS by the 'Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.4 Timesharing' banner,
           and the ACCOUNT ID? prompt.  IRIS allows unlimited tries at hacking
           in, and keeps no logs of bad attempts.  I don't know any default
           passwords, so just try the common ones from the password database
           below.

VM/CMS-    The VM/CMS operating system runs in International Business Machines
           (IBM) mainframes.  When you connect to one of these, you will get
           message similar to 'VM/370 ONLINE', and then give you a '.' prompt,
           just like TOPS-10 does.  To login, you type 'LOGON <username>'.
           Common Accounts/Defaults are:
           AUTOLOG1:            AUTOLOG or AUTOLOG1
           CMS:                 CMS

NOS-       NOS stands for Networking Operating System, and runs on the Cyber
           computer made by Control Data Corporation.  NOS identifies itself
           quite readily, with a banner of 'WELCOME TO THE NOS SOFTWARE
           SYSTEM.  COPYRIGHT CONTROL DATA 1978,1987'.  The first prompt you
           will get will be FAMILY:.  Just hit return here.  Then you'll get
           a USER NAME: prompt.  Usernames are typically 7 alpha-numerics
           characters long, and are *extremely* site dependent. Operator
           accounts begin with a digit, such as 7ETPDOC.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           $SYSTEM              unknown
           SYSTEMV              unknown
Decserver- This is not truly a computer system, but is a network server that
           has many different machines available from it.  A Decserver will
           say 'Enter Username>' when you first connect.  This can be anything,
           it doesn't matter, it's just an identifier.  Type 'c', as this is
           the least conspicuous thing to enter.  It will then present you
           with a 'Local>' prompt.  From here, you type 'c <systemname>' to
           connect to a system.  To get a list of system names, type
           'sh services' or 'sh nodes'.  If you have any problems, online
           help is available with the 'help' command.  Be sure and look for
           services named 'MODEM' or 'DIAL' or something similar, these are
           often outdial modems and can be useful!
GS/1-      Another type of network server.  Unlike a Decserver, you can't
           predict what prompt a GS/1 gateway is going to give you.  The
           default prompt it 'GS/1>', but this is redifinable by the
           system administrator.  To test for a GS/1, do a 'sh d'.  If that
           prints out a large list of defaults (terminal speed, prompt,
           parity, etc...), you are on a GS/1.  You connect in the same manner
           as a Decserver, typing 'c <systemname>'.  To find out what systems
           are available, do a 'sh n' or a 'sh c'.  Another trick is to do a
           'sh m', which will sometimes show you a list of macros for logging
           onto a system.  If there is a macro named VAX, for instance, type
           'do VAX'.
           The above are the main system types in use today.  There are
           hundreds of minor variants on the above, but this should be
           enough to get you started.
Unresponsive Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Occasionally you will connect to a system that will do nothing but sit
there.  This is a frustrating feeling, but a methodical approach to the system
will yield a response if you take your time.  The following list will usually
make *something* happen.
1)  Change your parity, data length, and stop bits.  A system that won't re-
    spond at 8N1 may react at 7E1 or 8E2 or 7S2.  If you don't have a term
    program that will let you set parity to EVEN, ODD, SPACE, MARK, and NONE,
    with data length of 7 or 8, and 1 or 2 stop bits, go out and buy one.
    While having a good term program isn't absolutely necessary, it sure is
    helpful.
2)  Change baud rates.  Again, if your term program will let you choose odd
    baud rates such as 600 or 1100, you will occasionally be able to penetrate
    some very interesting systems, as most systems that depend on a strange
    baud rate seem to think that this is all the security they need...
3)  Send a series of <cr>'s.
4)  Send a hard break followed by a <cr>.
5)  Type a series of .'s (periods).  The Canadian network Datapac responds
    to this.
6)  If you're getting garbage, hit an 'i'.  Tymnet responds to this, as does
    a MultiLink II.
7)  Begin sending control characters, starting with ^A --> ^Z.
8)  Change terminal emulations.  What your vt100 emulation thinks is garbage
    may all of a sudden become crystal clear using ADM-5 emulation.  This also
    relates to how good your term program is.
9)  Type LOGIN, HELLO, LOG, ATTACH, CONNECT, START, RUN, BEGIN, LOGON, GO,
    JOIN, HELP, and anything else you can think of.
10) If it's a dialin, call the numbers around it and see if a company
    answers.  If they do, try some social engineering.
Brute Force Hacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There will also be many occasions when the default passwords will not work
on an account.  At this point, you can either go onto the next system on your
list, or you can try to 'brute-force' your way in by trying a large database
of passwords on that one account.  Be careful, though!  This works fine on
systems that don't keep track of invalid logins, but on a system like a VMS,
someone is going to have a heart attack if they come back and see '600 Bad
Login Attempts Since Last Session' on their account.  There are also some
operating systems that disconnect after 'x' number of invalid login attempts
and refuse to allow any more attempts for one hour, or ten minutes, or some-
times until the next day.
   The following list is taken from my own password database plus the data-
base of passwords that was used in the Internet UNIX Worm that was running
around in November of 1988.  For a shorter group, try first names, computer
terms, and obvious things like 'secret', 'password', 'open', and the name
of the account.  Also try the name of the company that owns the computer
system (if known), the company initials, and things relating to the products
the company makes or deals with.
