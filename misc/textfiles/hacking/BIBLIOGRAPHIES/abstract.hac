           is the key to any new program, and computer security personnel must
           make it easy for busy CEOs to comprehend their security needs and
           options.  Confusion among different departments makes implementing
           security a challenge.

Abstract:  The recent "virus" attack on computers linked to a major research
           network may result in resistance to linking instututional computers
           to networks, but these networks are important to scholars and
