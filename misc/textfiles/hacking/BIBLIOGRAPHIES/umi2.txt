           of a computer virus.  The virus and attempts by computer experts at
           the University of California at Berkeley and the Massachusetts
           Institute of Technology to cure it are examined.

Abstract:  ARPANET, the world's first packet switching network, has been a
           vital element in the nation's computer and communications research
           activities, but its managers determined that it was technologically
           obsolete.  The ARPANET lives on in the networks it has spawned, now
           known as the Internet.  Photograph
