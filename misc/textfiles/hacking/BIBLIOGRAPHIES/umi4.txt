Authors:   Schultz, Brad

Abstract:  ARPANET, the world's first packet switching network, has been a
           vital element in the nation's computer and communications research
           activities, but its managers determined that it was technologically
           obsolete.  The ARPANET lives on in the networks it has spawned, now
           known as the Internet.  Photograph
