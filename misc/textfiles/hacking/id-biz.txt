So, You want to earn some extra money this summer? Well I've got a plan that
will make you RICH!!!!!! And it's the greatest summer job you'll ever have.
So you ask, how do I do it? Well all you need is a couple of hours and lots
of friends under 21 !!

The business, Selling identities! That's right! This is not some basement
made photo ID's it's selling a person's identity! Then your friends do to the
Department of Motor Vehicle and get the REAL THING!! Here's how:


Step 1

Go to your local county records office. Most counties in the US have all
their paper documents on Microfilm and the records are available for public
viewing. The records you want are Death Certificates. Here's what you need to
get:

-Name
-Date of Death before January 1, 1976
-Date of Birth Between 1970 and 1975
-Mothers Maiden Name
-Fathers Name


Step 2

After you get the information you need, (get as many names as you want to
sell) write the information of each person on strips of paper.

Step 3

Now here comes the fun part, You now have the completed product. Sell them to
your friends and collect the fee. The price can be $1 or $1000 but you'll
want to keep the price reasonable. Remember your selling to your friends and
other people your age who probably don't work and don't have a lot of cash! A
good price is $50.00. Give this next section to the people you sell them to.

                                            What to Do!

Step 1

     With the information you have you'll be able to get a real ID with your
picture on it. First go to the County Records Office and request a birth
certificate. Act like it's yours they don't ask for any ID to get it and
usually only pay about $13.


Step 2

     Go to a Department of Motor Vehicles. It's preferable not to use the one
in your state, because when you turn 21 you'll want one there and they'll
have your finger prints on file. BIG MISTAKE!!! Make sure that the DMV you go
to gives you your ID right away and not through the mail. Now pay the nice
man and get your new identity!!!!


Step 3

     I don't think you need me to tell you what to do next, I'm sure you
little party animals will be able to figure it out!!
