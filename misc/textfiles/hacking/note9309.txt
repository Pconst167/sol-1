  As most of you will realize, this month's issue was late again.  It seems
  that every time the release date rolls around, something happens to
  either my system or myself.  In this case, it was both - a system crash,
  immediately followed by a back injury.

  In any event, I have come to the conclusion that I can no longer hold to
  a strict release date for the report.  I have managed to keep it up
  almost every month for nearly the past two years, a record of which I am
  quite proud of.  However, my problems over the past few months are not
  only affecting me:  they are affecting those of you who have set up
  events to file request the report, and those who call from overseas to
  download it.

  I don't feel like I am being fair to you by promising to release the
  report on a specific date and then delaying the release.

  What I will do from now on is announce the release of the report in all
  of the major networks and echos in which it is distributed.  I will also
  try to notify all FidoNet Distribution Sites via NetMail when the report
  is released.  I will still try to hold to the same release date (i.e.,
  first Sunday of the month), but I can no longer guarantee this.

  If this causes any difficulty for any distribution site, and you wish to
  back out as a site, I understand fully.  I sincerely apologize for the
  problems, and I hope this won't cause much more inconvenience.

  Thank you for your continued support, your patience, and for helping to
  keep shareware clean!
