  INFO ON RAMPART SYSTEMS
  -----------------------

  RAMPART SYSTEMS ARE USED BY CO'S
SUCH AS METRO,MCI,SPRINT,ECT. WE HAVE
FOUND THAT THEY ARE USUALLY SET UP LIKE
WESTERN UNION'S EASYLINK SYSTEM. HERE
IS A EXMAMPLE FOR METRO...

YOU DIAL THE LDS SERVICE WHICH IN THIS
CASE IS 314/342-1130 THEN YOU WOULD
ENTER A CODE SUCH AS XXXXXX, THEN IT 
WOULD GIVE A CARRIER. YOU HAVE TO HAVE
1200BPS TO CONNECT WITH THIS SYSTEM.

  HACKING RAMPART
  ---------------

  FIRST OFF YOU'LL HAVE TO GET A ACCT.
OR CODE TO ACCESS THE RAMPART SYSTEM TO
DO THIS YOU'LL NEED TO WRITE A SIMPLE
PROGRAM THAT WILL WARDIAL THAT LDS AND
ENTER CODES EITHER SEQ. OR RAND., AND
DO NOT HAVE IT DIAL A CARRIER LIKE ON
A REGULAR CODE HACKER. IF IT IS THE
CODE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IT WILL GIVE A
CARRIER IMMEDIATLEY AFTER DIALING IT.
  IT WILL CONNECT 300 & 1200, BUT WILL
ONLY LET YOU ON THE MAIN SYSTEM 1200BPS
WHEN IT FINDS A CODE FOR RAMPART HAVE
IT CHECK FOR THE CARRIER DETECT, AND
RECORD THE CODE'S THAT GET THE CARRIER
DETECT.
