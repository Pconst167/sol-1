                     Becoming More Informed...

         It was Sunday, January 19th, 1992. I was sorting through the local
       News Journal Paper and I discovered an article of interest in the local
       section. "Hackers don't leave calling card" was the title of this
       article. It seems a man named David Jarinko recieved what he thought was
       a large bill of $291.05. Then to his suprise he received a second bill,
       a mamoth 69 page bill totalling $6,834.39! There were calls to all over
       the US, all from Kuwait City, Kuwait. It seems all the troops from
       Operation Desert Storm called home with this card, which they probably
       received from a European hacker. The guy then called At&t and only ended
       up paying for his original bill with the Phone Company taking a big
       loss.
        The real useful information about all of this is what the phone
       companies already know or claim to know about these crimes. In the
       article a higher up in AT&t stated many times the cards are stolen
       from the company data bases and or CBI accounts. Then when AT&T start
       seeing the card pop up all over the place they check with the owner
       and if they can not contact the owner they cancel the card.
        Another interesting follow up article had to do with information on
       how someone could avoid becoming a victim of the scam. They recommend
       such common known ideas as not letting anyone see your card numbers
       when you punch them in at a pay phone and to absolutely never give
       out your credit card numbers on the phone. The article closed by
       reminding everyone the credit card fraud is a serious crime and the
       penalties are getting more severe than in the past. Another point of
       interest was that it said there are special agencies in the phone
       company, FBI and secret service are established to bring to an end the
       unlawful theft of services. My thoughts are that if they know this
       much, why don't they stop it right now? But anyway this text was made
       to inform you and let you know exactly what the agencies know.
