I. INTRODUCTION

  THE EASY LINK SYSTEM, OPERATED IN
154 COUNTRIES BY WESTERN UNION IS A
WORLD-WIDE SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR THE
PURPOSE OF ELECTRONIC MAILING AND
CATERS TO SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND
IMPORTANT PEOPLE.
  THE EASY LINK SYSTEM HAS SYSTEM BRANCHES
IN EVERY STATE ALONG WIPH THE 153
OTHER COUNTRIES MENTIONED (MAKING
IT ECONOMICAL TO HACK).


II. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

  IN ORDER TO USE (OR HACK) THE EASY
LINK SYSTEM, YOUR TERMINAL MUST
BE CONFIGURED TO THE FOLLOWING PARA-
METERS -

    - 7 DATA BITS
    - 1 STOP BIT
    - EVEN PARITY
    - 110, 300 OR 1200 BAUD

  OBVIOUSLY, USING ANY OTHER CONFIGURATION
WILL NOT ENABLE YOU TO UTILIZE (OR
HACK) THE EASY LINK SYSTEM.


III. HACKING EASY LINK

  THE EASY LINK SYSTEM HAS A MEDIOCRE
SECURITY SYSTEM FOR PROTECTING ITSELF
WHICH INCLUDES A USERNAME (WHICH IS
NOT THE ACTUAL NAME OF THE SUBSCRIBER),
A PASSWORD, AND SEVERAL OTHER METHODS
OF PREVENTING PENETRATION. HOWEVER,
AS WITH ANY SYSTEM, IT IS NOT TOTALLY
SECURE FROL HACKING.

  THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF PROMPTS
THAT THE EASY LINK SYSTEM WILL GIVE
YOU ONCE A CONNECTION IS MADE (SEE
SECTION IV FOR NUMBERS). NOTE THAT
SYSTEM (EASY LINK) CHARACTERS ARE
[IN BRACKETS].


[PLEASE ENTER YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER]

  IF YOU ARE USING 300 OR 1200 BAUD,
TYPE "A".


[PLEASE LOGIN]

  THIS IS A TRICKY PART FOR THE HACKER
WHO IS A NOVICE TO THE SYSTEM, AT
THIS PROMPT YOU MUST TYPE CTRL-P AND
NO [RETURN]. YOU WILL NOT GET
ANOTHER PROMPT UNTILL TYPING "ESL"
AFTER YOU ENTER THE CTRL-P.


[ID?]

  THIS PROMPT SIGNALS THAT YOU
HAVE PENATRATED THE PRIMARY SYSTEM
OF SECURITY AND IS ALSO THE HARDEST
PART 4O HACK, ESPECIALLY TO THE
NOVICE. THIS IS TRUW BECAUSE THERE
ARE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH MUST
BE ENTERED IN THE CORRECT FORMAT
IN ORDER TO PENATRATE THIS FINAL
SECURITY STAGE.
  THE FOLLOWING IS THE FORMAT IN
WHICH THE FIELDS (TERMINAL IDENTIFIER,
IDENTIFICATION, USERNAME, AND
PASSWORD) ARE TO BE ENTERED -

ID?00 EID62#### USERNAME.PASSWORD

  THE SPACES INDICATED ARE ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY FOR THE CORRECT FORMAT!
  THE "00" SHOWN IS A TERMINAL
INDENTIFIER OF WHICH I ASSUME
"00" IS PRETTY MUCH THE STANDARD.
  THE SIX (6) NUMBER SIGNS THAT FOLLOW
THE "EID62" ARE FOR A 4 NUMBER ID
FIELD WHICH IS PARTICULAR TO EACH
SUBSCRIBER.
  THE "USERNAME" IS A USERNAME WHICH
IS N*O*T THE NAME OF THE SUBSCRIBER
(I HAVE FOUND THAT MOST USER NAMES
CONSIST OF 4 LETTERS).
  THE "PASSWORD" IS A PASSWORD THAT
IS ALSO PARTICULAR TO EACH SUBSCRIBER.
(I HAVE FOUND THAT MOST PASSWORDS
ARE 3 LETTERS IN LENGTH, BUT I AM
NOT SURE).

       *GETTING TO THIS POINT IS AN*
            *ACCOMPLISHMENT*

  ONCE INSIDE, YOU WORK PARTIALLY
OFF OF MENUS AND MOSTLY OFF OF
THE MANUAL AND YOUR OWN SKILL.


IV. N&Y.S. NUMBERS

  THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF EASY LINK
NUMBERS FOR NEW YORK STATE (LONG
ISLAND) -

      O  HEMPSTED    - 516-485-7422
      O  HUNTINGTON  - 516-420-1221
      O  MELVILLE    -  "   "   "
      O  MINEOLA     - 516-294-3120


V. CONCLUSION

  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THIS
GUIDE TO HACKING THE EASY LINK SYSTEM
AS COMPREHENSIVE AND "HELPFUL" AS
POSSIBLE AS A PART OF MY SERIES.
