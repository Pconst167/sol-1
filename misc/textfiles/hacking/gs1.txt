Introduction:
    I wouldn't consider myself the best of all hackers or phreakers, but I am
learning. During one of my learning endeavors on Telenet and other PSNs, I
discovered (for my first time), the GS/1 system. Being inexperienced at the
time, I knew about the great value of any private PAD, and began experimenting
with the system, determined that this system was some type of PAD and that I
would figure out how to gain full network access with a simple command.
    I was right. And today, I'll welcome you to the world of power
communications. In this file, I hope you will learn a bit on the uses and
potential abuses of the GS/1 system; this is in no way, shape, or form, a
complete manual on the GS/1 system, but a compilation of my experimentation
on my first GS/1 system. So, just kick back and enjoy the file...


What Is The GS/1 System?
    The GS/1 system is a combination of three major packet switching functions
bundled into one. The GS/1 system can operate as a private PAD, a X.25+
gateway, and/or a network (WAN) server. It is this combination that makes
this system so versitile. However, you should also note that NOT ALL GS/1
systems may have all three features "set up" for use; oh well, just make do
with what you have right now... scan tommorrow for more!


Logging Onto A GS/1 System:
    As of today, I have not encountered a GS/1 PAD which had any type of logon
security whatsoever to gain access to its network "utilities." I don't know
if it's the software or the system operaters that are lagging or what, but it
sure makes it a helluvalot easier on my (and I'm sure) and your end.
    When you logon from Telenet or whatever PSN you are originating from,
you will probably see a short welcome or warning about the system you are
gaining access to, and then a default prompt of "GS/1> " (This prompt can be
changed by the system operator, but usually isn't...). Well now, you're in.
Now, that was the easy part.


Inside The GS/1:
    Once inside the GS/1 system, there are many options you can do, similar
to most PADs, gateways, and servers. The following was captured & edited from
a GS/1 system after hitting "?" at the "GS/1> " prompt.

      Connect     <address>[,<address>] [ ECM ] [ Q ]
      DEQueue     ???
      DisConnect  <session>
      DO          <macro name>
      Echo        <string>
      Listen
      Pause       [<seconds>]
      REMoteSET   ???
      REMoteSHow  ???
      RESume      <session>
      SET         <param-name> = <value> ...
      SHow        <argument> ...
      SWitch      <session>
      Transmit    ???
      N...        Privileged Command
      U...        Privileged Command
      Z...        Privileged Command

    As you can see, the commands are quite simple. I don't know if I listed all
of the commands above, but if you type in a single letter at the prompt, and
there are more commands present on the system that start with that letter,
GS/1 will show you the commands that begin with that letter to clear any user
confusion up.


GS/1 Command Summary:
    Letters in CAPS are the only letters necessary to execute the given
command in GS/1! Also note that appending a '?' to the end of any FULL or
PARTIAL command will USUALLY prompt GS/1 to offer you some assistance in
summarizing the command/argument you are attempting to use.

    Connect     <address>[,<address>] [ ECM ] [ Q ]
        The Connect command is by far the most useful utility on GS/1 that
        I am aware of. Through proper formatting and usage, this command
        will allow you to access ANY NUA accessible through Telenet, as if
        you had entered an NUI. I will discuss a bit more on connecting
        to NUAs later. Also, GS/1 allows the use of "ClearingHouseNames"
        in the place of NUAs; sort of like how you can enter things on
        Telenet at the "@" prompt, like "PORTAL," "TELEMAIL," and the such.
        More on ClearingHouseNames later!

    DEQueue     ???
        I have no idea what this command does.

    DisConnect  <session>
        This command will disconnect the PAD from a session. The GS/1 PAD
        allows multiple connections (probably a max of 10-20) during the
        read-time. Each session is numbered from 1-x where x is the last
        session connected to. DC x will disconnect from session x, thus
        hang-up from the system which was connected to at session x.

    DO          <macro name>
        This command will allow you to execute a macro file on-line. On the
        GS/1, this could mean auto-logon to a private outdial system, a
        LAN, another WAN, or who knows. More on macros later.

    Echo        <string>
        This command re-prints whatever is placed in the <string> parameter.
        I believe this is for parity and data transmission verification, most
        similar to Telenet's ECHO CHAR and such...

    Listen
        Although this command says 'Listen,' it really is 'Logoff.' Hitting
        L will disconnect ALL current sessions under the port number you
        logged onto under, and disconnect you from the GS/1 PAD.

    Pause       [<seconds>]
        This command will pause your terminal for the specified number of
        seconds.

    REMoteSET   ???
        Sorry, I have no information on this command.

    REMoteSHow  ???
        Sorry, I have no information on this command.

    RESume      <session>
        If you have connected onto 1 or more systems and "broken" out of them,
        in likeness to breaking out of a system in Telenet by typing '@,' and
        you would like to RESume a session that is still currently connected,
        this command will allow you to do just that.

    SET         <param-name> = <value> ...
        The SET command allows you to change terminal and PAD characteristics,
        the following is a PARTIAL list of options one could change when under
        GS/1:

            BAud            BSDelay         BSPad           CRDelay
            CRPad           DataBits        DeVice          DUplex
            FFDelay         FFPad           InterAction     LFDelay
            LFPad           PARIty          PRIvilege       StopBits
            TabDelay        TabPad

        Most of those parameters should be obvious. Again, if you want to know
        more paramters available, just type SET x, where x is the first
        character to any parameter, and if that charachter is the first
        character to 2 or more parameters, those paramters will be listed to
        help "solve" any user confusion.

    SHow        <argument> ...
        This command will display the parameters under effect (similar to
        the SET parameters), and will also show you other prominent information
        you just might be interested in. Here are the SHow arguments available:

            SHow    ADDRess
            SHow    ClearingHouseNames [ <name> [ @ <domain> [@ <organ.> ] ] ]
            SHow    DefaultParameters [<param-name> ...]
            SHow    GLobalPARameters
            SHow    NetMAP [ Short | Long ]
            SHow    PARAmeterS [<param-name> ...]
            SHow    <param-name> ...
            SHow    SESsions [ P ]
            SHow    VERSion

        Most of the arguments should be obvious except the ClearingHouseNames
        argument, which will show you the ClearingHouseNames to several systems
        which are either defaulted to a connect macro to the specified system,
        or within a WAN. The format of the names are:

            SYSTEMNAME@LOCATION@ACCOUNT

        Where SYSTEMNAME is the name/description of the destination system, the
        LOCATION is the city of the SYSTEMNAME, and the ACCOUNT is usually the
        owner/operator of the GS/1 PAD. To connect directly to a
        ClearingHouseName, all you have to do is:

            Connect SYSTEMNAME

        And the GS/1 PAD will search the ClearingHouseNames database for the
        system and other pertinent network info for you, and connect you up to
        that system.

    SWitch      <session>
        SWitch will allow you to change to a different system if you are
        connected to multiple sessions (more than 1 system at a time).

    Transmit    ???
        Sorry, no information concerning this command; however, it appears
        to be some sort of utility similar to either 'UUCP' or the Telenet
        bulk data transfer ready command (DTAPE).

    N...        Privileged Command
    U...        Privileged Command
    Z...        Privileged Command
        The above are Privileged account commands; sorry, I haven't been
        able to secure any privileged passwords as of yet... but I'll be
        working on it.

Connecting To NUAs:
    One feature I really like about the GS/1 system (and it was not fun hacking
out the format to this one), is the -almost- unlimited network access this
PAD has. So, you wanna connect to some long distance NUAs, eh? Or you wanna
dial PC-Pursuit's outdial system direct and save yourself a few bux by
bypassing Telenet-PCP security? This is the one for you then.

    Syntax:

        Connect !xxx#DNICyyyzzzzz

        Where xxx is the port that will make the dial, (usually anywhere from
            00-99 or more), DNIC is the DNIC of the address without any
            leading 0's, yyy is the NPA or Prefix (if applicable), and zzzz
            is the suffix (if applicable).

    Example:
        We want to connect to 0311021200032, through port number 33:

        Connect !33#311021200032


What The Hell Is A PORT?
    A port on the GS/1 PAD is the address you have logged onto on the current
GS/1 system as well as addresses GS/1 uses to "call out" when you use any type
of Connect command. To find out what port number you are currently on, type:

    SHow ADDRess

    This will give some sort of a cryptic number with %'s and other symbols in
it, but we're looking for the PORT number here... Aha! The port number is the
NUMERICAL amount following the '!' in the string. There, you now have YOUR port
number (and like Telenet with local dialins, that port number may change if you
call back at a later date and someone/noone is on the system at the same time
as you).
    Big deal. You have your port number... Now what? Now you have a location
to work with. Suppose your port number is 55. GS/1 has ports numbered in
increasing order, so if you have port 55, you can try the "Connect" command
through port 56,54,57,53 or similarly numbered ports. Understand?
    What GS/1 does when you execute a Connect command to another NUA, GS/1
utilizes one of its ports to make the "call." Thus, when you enter:

        Connect !xxx#DNICyyyzzzzz

    The xxx (PORT number) you choose MUST be an open port. If a user is on
it, or you are on it, or it doesn't exist, you will either receive an error
message or a message stating that the port/address was busy. Try another port.


Other GS/1 Notes:
    Some comments on the GS/1 PAD, Gateway, Server:

    1) The PAD Delay when connected to MOST system through the GS/1 system
       is increased (pretty drastically), and might cause input from your
       terminal to appear sluggish and slow. However, incomming data is
       not hindered in that fashion.

    2) To access PRIvileged commands, type:

           SET PRIvilege

       You will be prompted for a password. If you get it right, good job. If
       not, I do not know whether or not the GS/1 system records any such hack
       attempts, but don't press your luck in hacking out the password if
       the GS/1 PAD you are hacking in is the only PAD you have access to!

    3) The GS/1 system usually does not send linefeeds and does not recognize
       destructive backspaces when connected at 8,N,1; however, linefeeds and
       destructive backspaces are compensated for at connections with E,7,1.

    4) A trick on some GS/1 systems is to type:

           SHow Macros

        Which will show you a bunch of macros for the DO command; however,
        on most GS/1 systems, this command has been edged out, EXCEPT to
        the privileged (of course).

    5) I don't know the charachter/control key that will "break" out of a
       session and place you back on the GS/1 prompt. I know this is possible,
       but... oh well... time to experiment some more.


Conclusion:
    Well, I hope you enjoyed reading this file on the GS/1 PAD, Gateway,
and Server as much as I enjoyed typing it (hahahaha...). Anyway, I am sick of
typing, I just want to say one thing: Future Transcendent Saga WINS....
