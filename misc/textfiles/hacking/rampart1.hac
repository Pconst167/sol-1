YOU HAVE TO HAVE1200BPS TO CONNECT WITH THIS SYSTEM.  HACKING RAMPART  ---------------  FIRST OFF YOU'LL HAVE TO GET A ACCT.OR CODE TO ACCESS THE RAMPART SYSTEM TODO THIS YOU'LL NEED TO WRITE A SIMPLEPROGRAM THAT WILL WARDIAL THAT LDS ANDENTER CODES EITHER SEQ.

IF IT IS THECODE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IT WILL GIVE ACARRIER IMMEDIATLEY AFTER DIALING IT.  IT WILL CONNECT 300 & 1200, BUT WILLONLY LET YOU ON THE MAIN SYSTEM 1200BPSWHEN IT FINDS A CODE FOR RAMPART HAVEIT CHECK FOR THE CARRIER DETECT, ANDRECORD THE CODE'S THAT GET THE CARRIERDETECT.  ] HACKING RAMPART ACCT [  OK AFTER YOU HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR ANDARE CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM, IT WILLGIVE YOU A '>' PROMPT.

USERTRUNK NUMBERS ALWAYS START AT ONE, ANDEND AT THE NUMBER OF TRUNKS IN THEGROUP. SYSTEM TRUNK NUMBERS ARE THENUMBERS USED TO ACCESS TRUNKS ON THESWITCH AND MAY RANGE FROM 0 TO 65000.FOR COMMANDS WHICH REQUIRE TRUNKNUMBERS,THE '/SY' SWITCH SHOULD BEADDED TO THE COMMAND LINE WHEN REFER-ENCING SYSTEM TRUNK NUMBERS.     ->DATABASE      RAMPART DATABASE OVERVIEWTHE RAMPART USER DATABASE IS COMPRISEDOF THE FOLLOWING TWO FILES:(1) CENTR.

AS COMMON LANGAUGE CODES,LITERAL CENTRAL OFFICE NAMES, ROTL TYPEAND ACCESS NUMBER, TESTLINE TYPES ANDACCESS NUMBERS,ECT.(2) TRUNK SOURCE FILE- THIS FILE   DESCRIBES THE TRUNKS LINKING <CO>INTHE <COD>FILE. IT CONTAINS SUCH INFO ASTRUNK GROUP ID, NUMBER OF TRUNKS INGROUP, LIMITS DATA, TRANSMIT LEVEL,SIGNALLING,ROUTINE TEST INTERVAL,ECT.THESE FILES CAN BE UPDATED BY THE USERSOURCE EDITOR (USE) PROGRAM (INVOKED BYTHE CMDS 'EDIT' & 'RUN USE'). [DATABASE SUB-CMDS]EXAMPLECOD        CEN-TRAL^OFFICETRUNK    ->DATABASE CODTHIS FILE CONTAINS INFORMATION ON THE EQPT.
