P H R E A K I N G
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not familiar with the term, it basically means ripping off the phone
company. ie Free Phone calls.  Australia is not as luck as the yank, because
CCITT #5 will not support the many gadgets the yanks use on their Bell system.
Basically the fiels you get on phreaking from the USA will not work.
There might be some light ahead when tone dialing is more universally used down
here and it will be a bonanza if and when telecom is privatised.
Although phreaking is not as easy, where there's a will, there's a way.
One can be absolutelly certain that a technitian here and there installed a
small circuit at the exchange to give him free calls.  The existance of such
gadgets at the exchange have been documented by British Telecom, so there is no
reason why they shouldn't be in use here.  I think an easy form of phreaking
is possible, it's just that we haven't looked hard enough. At the present,
these methods are available.

1 - The crude system of attaching physically to someone elses phone line.
    I wouldn't recomend this and I guess one has to be in great need to be
    crazy doing things like that.

2 - I guess you have heard of the calling card system. NO?  Well, salesman and
    people on the move who need to make calls from phones can get a TELECARD.
    They simply quote the telecard number and dial from any phone.  The bill is
    then credited on the card, not on the phone bill.  Yeah you got it. Borrow
    the telecard number from somewhere.

3 - Who said you can't make a call using a credit card ey?  Worth a try no?
    This is not my style, but if you are low enough to practice credit card
    fraud go for it.

4 - Simmilar to a telecard, the yanks have the same system.  Believe it or not,
    their cards can be used from here.  At the moment only MCI calling cards
    can be used from here and they are hard to get.  I have spoken to a sprint
    operator and I have been informed that they are negotiating with australia
    for the same capability and we all known how easy sprint codes are easy to
    get in the USA.   Anyway for MCI, just get number and add  1M in front of
    it and a sufix (1 digit i think) and one can use it from here. oh yeah,
    Thanx to TRADER for this info.

5 - This brings us to the PABX method.  A PABX or PBX as some call it is
    something I never understood too well, but the way I see it, it's something
    like a private phone system. Ie exchange and the works.  For a large
    company for example it is more economical to install a PABX then having
    all of the lines comming directly from a telecom exchange or having
    operators to switch the call within the company's phone network.
    This is more or less how it works.
     - One dials a number.  It should answer, and the company's dial tone
       should be heard.  Then by dialing a preset number a person can connect
       to any phone on the internal network.
     - By dialing a certain code usually a certain number of 3's ie 3333, one
       can get onto an out going line.  This can be used to dial
       Internationally etc.  You can bet that some sort of a id code will be
       required. Usually about 4 digits.  Some PABX's may have just the one
       code to get onto the out-going line, and as soon as you get on, you can
       dial to anywhere.
     Im still trying to find more on PABX's, but they have been used
     succesfully by Phreaks in the past.

I hope I don't need to remind you to use common sense. I think it would be
suicide to use a Calling card from anything by a phone box, so just take care.

What about the future?
Well, I think that a lot of research can be done in the field of satellites and
in the area of mobile phones and the new cellular network.  It should be
possible to make calls with a bit of hardware. After all, if one can crack the
code, how can telcum tell where the call is comming from?
As far as satellites go, if you ever have access to one, try tuning to the
8mhz range.  You'll be pleasantly surprised or so I'm told.  In this range,
it should be possible to pick up one way phone conversations and data carriers.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Well, I guess thats all from me for now.  There is more, but that is yet to
come.  I'm doing research at the moment and my aim is to write a series of
files few megs long covering everything I can think of in greater detail.
The FORCE FILES are not for general distribution, so be carefull where you
post them up.   Good hacking boards are fine, but that's where it should stop,
or the info will become useless. Till Next Time.
