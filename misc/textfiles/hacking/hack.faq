     IN STANDARD UNIX THE PASSWORD FILE IS /ETC/PASSWD.  ON A UNIX SYSTEM
      WITH EITHER NIS/YP OR PASSWORD SHADOWING, MUCH OF THE PASSWORD DATA
                               MAY BE ELSEWHERE.

                      02. HOW DO I CRACK UNIX PASSWORDS?
                                       
     CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, UNIX PASSWORDS CANNOT BE DECRYPTED.  UNIX
      PASSWORDS ARE ENCRYPTED WITH A ONE WAY FUNCTION.  THE LOGIN PROGRAM
      ENCRYPTS THE TEXT YOU ENTER AT THE "PASSWORD:" PROMPT AND COMPARES
      THAT ENCRYPTED STRING AGAINST THE ENCRYPTED FORM OF YOUR PASSWORD.
                                       
     PASSWORD CRACKING SOFTWARE USES WORDLISTS.  EACH WORD IN THE WORDLIST
        IS ENCRYPTED WITH EACH OF THE 4096 POSSIBLE SALT VALUES AND THE
      RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO THE ENCRYPTED FORM OF THE TARGET PASSWORD.
                                       
      THE BEST CRACKING PROGRAM FOR UNIX PASSWORDS IS CURRENTLY CRACK BY
        ALEC MUFFETT.  FOR PC-DOS, THE BEST PACKAGE TO USE IS CURRENTLY
                                 CRACKERJACK.
                                       
                                       
                        03. WHAT IS PASSWORD SHADOWING?
                                       
     PASSWORD SHADOWING IS A SECURITY SYSTEM WHERE THE ENCRYPTED PASSWORD
        FIELD OF /ETC/PASSWORD IS REPLACED WITH A SPECIAL TOKEN AND THE
     ENCRYPTED PASSWORD IS STORED IN A SEPARATE FILE WHICH IS NOT READABLE
                            BY NORMAL SYSTEM USERS.

      TO DEFEAT PASSWORD SHADOWING ON MANY (BUT NOT ALL) SYSTEMS, WRITE A
        PROGRAM THAT USES SUCCESSIVE CALLS TO GETPWENT() TO OBTAIN THE
                                PASSWORD FILE.

    NIS (NETWORK INFORMATION SYSTEM) IN THE CURRENT NAME FOR WHAT WAS ONCE
       KNOWN AS YP (YELLOW PAGES).  THE PURPOSE FOR NIS IS TO ALLOW MANY
      MACHINES ON A NETWORK TO SHARE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION, INCLUDING
      PASSWORD DATA. NIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO PROMOTE SYSTEM SECURITY.  IF
     YOUR SYSTEM USES NIS YOU WILL HAVE A VERY SHORT /ETC/PASSWD FILE WITH
                         A LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:
                                       
                                   +::0:0:::
                                       
        TO VIEW THE REAL PASSWORD FILE USE THIS COMMAND "YPCAT PASSWD"
                                       
                                       
    05. WHAT ARE THOSE WEIRD CHARACTERS AFTER THE COMMA IN MY PASSWD FILE?
                                       
      THE CHARACTERS ARE PASSWORD AGING DATA.  PASSWORD AGING FORCES THE
    USER TO CHANGE PASSWORDS AFTER A SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR SPECIFIED PERIOD
     OF TIME.  PASSWORD AGING CAN ALSO FORCE A USER TO KEEP A PASSWORD FOR
                 A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WEEKS BEFORE CHANGING IT.

     NOTE THE COMMA IN THE ENCRYPTED PASSWORD FIELD.  THE CHARACTERS AFTER

                THE FOUR CHARACTERS ARE INTERPRETED AS FOLLOWS:
                                       
       1: MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WEEKS A PASSWORD CAN BE USED WITHOUT CHANGING.
       2: MINIMUM NUMBER OF WEEKS A PASSWORD MUST BE USED BEFORE CHANGING.
      3&4: LAST TIME PASSWORD WAS CHANGED, IN NUMBER OF WEEKS SINCE 1970.
                                       
                     THREE SPECIAL CASES SHOULD BE NOTED:
                                       
      IF THE FIRST AND SECOND CHARACTERS ARE SET TO '..' THE USER WILL BE
      FORCED TO CHANGE HIS/HER PASSWD THE NEXT TIME HE/SHE LOGS IN.  THE

                                                             #hack FAQ (29/338)
     PASSWD PROGRAM WILL THEN REMOVE THE PASSWD AGING CHARACTERS, AND THE
       USER WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO PASSWORD AGING REQUIREMENTS AGAIN.
                                       
      IF THE THIRD AND FOURTH CHARACTERS ARE SET TO '..' THE USER WILL BE
    FORCED TO CHANGE HIS/HER PASSWD THE NEXT TIME HE/SHE LOGS IN. PASSWORD
     AGING WILL THEN OCCUR AS DEFINED BY THE FIRST AND SECOND CHARACTERS.
                                       
     IF THE FIRST CHARACTER (MAX) IS LESS THAN THE SECOND CHARACTER (MIN),
      THE USER IS NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE HIS/HER PASSWORD.  ONLY ROOT CAN
                          CHANGE THAT USERS PASSWORD.
                                       
    IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE SU COMMAND DOES NOT CHECK THE PASSWORD
        AGING DATA.  AN ACCOUNT WITH AN EXPIRED PASSWORD CAN BE SU'D TO
                 WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD.

                                1. CHANGE IFS.
                                       
      IF THE PROGRAM CALLS ANY OTHER PROGRAMS USING THE SYSTEM() FUNCTION

    CALL, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FOOL IT BY CHANGING IFS.  IFS IS THE INTERNAL
           FIELD SEPARATOR THAT THE SHELL USES TO DELIMIT ARGUMENTS.
                                       
             IF THE PROGRAM CONTAINS A LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:
                                       
                              SYSTEM("/BIN/DATE")
                                       
          AND YOU CHANGE IFS TO '/' THE SHELL WILL THEM INTERPRET THE
                              PROCEEDING LINE AS:
                                       
                                   BIN DATE
                                       
      NOW, IF YOU HAVE A PROGRAM OF YOUR OWN IN THE PATH CALLED "BIN" THE
           SUID PROGRAM WILL RUN YOUR PROGRAM INSTEAD OF /BIN/DATE.
                                       
                       TO CHANGE IFS, USE THIS COMMAND:
                                       
                    IFS='/';EXPORT IFS      # BOURNE SHELL
                       SETENV IFS '/'          # C SHELL
                     EXPORT IFS='/'          # KORN SHELL

                           2. LINK THE SCRIPT TO -I
                                       
        CREATE A SYMBOLIC LINK NAMED "-I" TO THE PROGRAM.  RUNNING "-I"
     WILL CAUSE THE INTERPRETER SHELL (/BIN/SH) TO START UP IN INTERACTIVE
                 MODE.  THIS ONLY WORKS ON SUID SHELL SCRIPTS.
                                       
                                   EXAMPLE:
                                       
                                % LN SUID.SH -I
                                     % -I
                                       #
                                       
                                       
                          3. EXPLOIT A RACE CONDITION
                                       
     REPLACE A SYMBOLIC LINK TO THE PROGRAM WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM WHILE THE
                          KERNEL IS LOADING /BIN/SH.
                                       
                                   EXAMPLE:

                       4. SEND BAD INPUT TO THE PROGRAM.
                                       
       INVOKE THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM AND A SEPARATE COMMAND ON THE SAME
                                 COMMAND LINE.
                                       
                                   EXAMPLE:

     FIND A SERVER THAT IS SPLIT FROM THE REST OF IRC AND CREATE YOUR OWN
     CHANNEL THERE USING THE NAME OF THE CHANNEL YOU WANT CHANOP ON.  WHEN

      CHARACTERS ARE.  ONE IS TO USE THE ARGUMENTS TO THE LS COMMAND THAT
                    CAUSE LS TO GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION:

     ON AN IBM-PC, YOU MAY ENTER THESE SPECIAL CHARACTERS BY HOLDING DOWN
       THE  KEY AND ENTERING THE DECIMAL VALUE OF THE SPECIAL CHARACTER
        ON YOUR NUMERIC KEYPAD.  WHEN YOU RELEASE THE  KEY, THE SPECIAL
      CHARACTER SHOULD APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN.  AN ASCII CHART CAN BE VERY

       DEVICE FOR PACKETS THAT INTEREST YOU.  WHEN YOUR SOFTWARE SEES A
      PACKET THAT FITS CERTAIN CRITERIA, IT LOGS IT TO A FILE.  THE MOST
     COMMON CRITERIA FOR AN INTERESTING PACKET IS ONE THAT CONTAINS WORDS
                          LIKE "LOGIN" OR "PASSWORD."

     AN INTERNET OUTDIAL IS A MODEM CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET THAN YOU CAN
    USE TO DIAL OUT.  NORMAL OUTDIALS WILL ONLY CALL LOCAL NUMBERS.  A GOD
    (GLOBAL OUTDIAL) IS CAPABLE OF CALLING LONG DISTANCE.  OUTDIALS ARE AN
              INEXPENSIVE METHOD OF CALLING LONG DISTANCE BBS'S.

  REBOOT AND WAIT FOR THE DATE/TIME QUESTION. TYPE ^C AND AT THE MCR PROMPT,
                  TYPE "ABO AT." YOU MUST INCLUDE THE . DOT!
                                       
    IF THIS WORKS, TYPE "ACS LB0:/BLKS=1000" TO GET SOME SWAP SPACE SO THE
                             NEW STEP WON'T WEDGE.
                                       
     TYPE " RUN $ACNT" AND CHANGE THE PASSWORD OF ANY ACCOUNT WITH A GROUP
                             NUMBER OF 7 OR LESS.
                                       
        YOU MAY FIND THAT THE ^C DOES NOT WORK. TRY ^Z AND ESC AS WELL.
           ALSO TRY ALL 3 AS TERMINATORS TO VALID AND INVALID TIMES.
                                       
      IF NONE OF THE ABOVE WORK, USE THE HALT SWITCH TO HALT THE SYSTEM,
     JUST AFTER A INVALID DATE-TIME.  LOOK FOR A USER MODE PSW 1[4-7]XXXX.
   THEN DEPOSIT 177777 INTO R6, CROSS YOUR FINGERS, WRITE PROTECT THE DRIVE
   AND CONTINUE THE SYSTEM.  THIS WILL HOPEFULLY RESULT IN INDIRECT BLOWING
          UP...  AND HOPEFULLY THE SYSTEM HAS NOT BEEN FULLY SECURED.

                 INSIDE IT.  WHEN AN AUTHORIZED USER PERFORMS THE APPARENT

    USE ATTRIB TO MAKE ALL OF YOUR EXE AND COM FILES READ ONLY.  THIS WILL
                 PROTECT YOU FROM MANY POORLY WRITTEN VIRUSES.

     SCAN ANY SOFTWARE THAT YOU RECEIVE WITH A RECENT COPY OF A GOOD VIRUS
    SCANNER.  THE BEST VIRUS SCANNER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR DOS IS F-PROT
     BY FRIDRIK SKULASON.  THE CURRENT VERSION IS FP-212C.  IT IS BEST TO

     ENCRYPTION.  AN ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IS CALLED CIPHERTEXT.  THE PROCESS
        OF TURNING CIPHERTEXT BACK INTO PLAINTEXT IS CALLED DECRYPTION.

     PGP(TM) USES PUBLIC-KEY ENCRYPTION TO PROTECT E-MAIL AND DATA FILES.
       COMMUNICATE SECURELY WITH PEOPLE YOU'VE NEVER MET, WITH NO SECURE
     CHANNELS NEEDED FOR PRIOR EXCHANGE OF KEYS.  PGP IS WELL FEATURED AND
       FAST, WITH SOPHISTICATED KEY MANAGEMENT, DIGITAL SIGNATURES, DATA
                    COMPRESSION, AND GOOD ERGONOMIC DESIGN.

     VAX/VMS, AND OTHER COMPUTERS.  PGP ALLOWS PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE FILES OR
    MESSAGES WITH PRIVACY, AUTHENTICATION, AND CONVENIENCE.  PRIVACY MEANS
          THAT ONLY THOSE INTENDED TO RECEIVE A MESSAGE CAN READ IT.
    AUTHENTICATION MEANS THAT MESSAGES THAT APPEAR TO BE FROM A PARTICULAR
      PERSON CAN ONLY HAVE ORIGINATED FROM THAT PERSON. CONVENIENCE MEANS
      THAT PRIVACY AND AUTHENTICATION ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT THE HASSLES OF
    MANAGING KEYS ASSOCIATED WITH CONVENTIONAL CRYPTOGRAPHIC SOFTWARE.  NO
    SECURE CHANNELS ARE NEEDED TO EXCHANGE KEYS BETWEEN USERS, WHICH MAKES
      PGP MUCH EASIER TO USE.  THIS IS BECAUSE PGP IS BASED ON A POWERFUL
               NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED "PUBLIC KEY" CRYPTOGRAPHY.
                                       
        PGP COMBINES THE CONVENIENCE OF THE RIVEST-SHAMIR-ADLEMAN (RSA)
     PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOSYSTEM WITH THE SPEED OF CONVENTIONAL CRYPTOGRAPHY,
        MESSAGE DIGESTS FOR DIGITAL SIGNATURES, DATA COMPRESSION BEFORE
     ENCRYPTION, GOOD ERGONOMIC DESIGN, AND SOPHISTICATED KEY MANAGEMENT.
       AND PGP PERFORMS THE PUBLIC-KEY FUNCTIONS FASTER THAN MOST OTHER
       SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS.  PGP IS PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY FOR THE
                                    MASSES.

     AN ANONYMOUS REMAILER IS A SYSTEM ON THE INTERNET THAT ALLOWS YOU TO
        SEND E-MAIL ANONYMOUSLY OR POST MESSAGES TO USENET ANONYMOUSLY.

                                                            #hack FAQ (71/2624)
      YOU APPLY FOR AN ANONYMOUS ID AT THE REMAILER SITE.  THEN, WHEN YOU
    SEND A MESSAGE TO THE REMAILER, IT SENDS IT OUT FROM YOUR ANONYMOUS ID
     AT THE REMAILER.  NO ONE READING THE POST WILL KNOW YOUR REAL ACCOUNT
     NAME OR HOST NAME.  IF SOMEONE SENDS A MESSAGE TO YOUR ANONYMOUS ID,
          IT WILL BE FORWARDED TO YOUR REAL ACCOUNT BY THE REMAILER.

       THE MOST POPULAR AND STABLE ANONYMOUS REMAILER IS ANON.PENET.FI,
         OPERATED BY JOHAN HELSINGUS.  TO OBTAIN AN ANONYMOUS ID, MAIL
     PING@ANON.PENET.FI.  FOR ASSISTANCE IS OBTAINING AN ANONYMOUS ACCOUNT

     THERE ARE TWO COMMON METHODS OF DEFEATING COPY PROTECTION.  THE FIRST
      IS TO USE A PROGRAM THAT REMOVES COPY PROTECTION.  POPULAR PROGRAMS
      THAT DO THIS ARE COPYIIPC FROM CENTRAL POINT SOFTWARE AND COPYWRITE

     MECHANISM.  WHEN IT DOES, CHANGE THAT PORTION OF THE CODE.  THE CODE
     CAN BE CHANGED FROM JE (JUMP ON EQUAL) OR JNE (JUMP ON NOT EQUAL) TO
     JMP (JUMP UNCONDITIONALLY).  OR THE CODE MAY SIMPLY BE REPLACED WITH

                            01. WHAT IS A RED BOX?
                                       
       WHEN A COIN IS INSERTED INTO A PAYPHONE, THE PHONE EMITS A SET OF
      TONES.  A RED BOX IS A DEVICE THAT SIMULATES THOSE TONES, WITH THE

                                                            #hack FAQ (71/2668)
      PURPOSE OF FOOLING THE PAYPHONE INTO BELIEVING YOU HAVE INSERTED AN
                      ACTUAL COIN.  THE ACTUAL TONES ARE:
                                       
                    NICKEL SIGNAL      1700+2200  0.060S ON
     DIME SIGNAL        1700+2200  0.060S ON, 0.060S OFF, TWICE REPEATING
      QUARTER SIGNAL     1700+2200  33MS ON, 33MS OFF, 5 TIMES REPEATING
                                       
                                       
                         02. HOW DO I BUILD A RED BOX?
                                       
      RED BOXES ARE COMMONLY MANUFACTURED FROM MODIFIED RADIO SHACK TONE
      DIALERS, HALLMARK GREETING CARDS, OR MADE FROM SCRATCH FROM READILY
                       AVAILABLE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS.
                                       
      TO MAKE A RED BOX FROM A RADIO SHACK 43-141 OR 43-146 TONE DIALER,
       OPEN THE DIALER AND REPLACE THE CRYSTAL (THE LARGEST SHINY METAL
    COMPONENT).  THE EXACT VALUE NEEDED IS 6.502457409MHZ.  UNFORTUNATELY,
      THAT CRYSTAL IS NOT COMMONLY MANUFACTURED.  A CRYSTAL CLOSE TO THAT
       VALUE WILL CREATE A TONE THAT FALLS WITHIN TOLERANCES.  THE MOST
        POPULAR CHOICE IS THE 6.5536MHZ CRYSTAL.  WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
    REPLACING THE CRYSTAL, PROGRAM THE P1 BUTTON WITH FIVE *'S.  THAT WILL
                SIMULATE A QUARTER TONE EACH TIME YOU PRESS P1.

                   03. WHERE CAN I GET A 6.5536MHZ CRYSTAL?
                                       
     YOUR BEST BET IS A LOCAL ELECTRONICS STORE.  RADIO SHACK SELLS THEM,
     BUT THEY ARE OVERPRICED AND THE STORE MUST ORDER THEM IN.  THIS TAKES
     APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS.  IN ADDITION, MANY RADIO SHACK EMPLOYEES DO
                        NOT KNOW THAT THIS CAN BE DONE.
                                       
     OR, YOU COULD ORDER THE CRYSTAL MAIL ORDER.  THIS INTRODUCES SHIPPING
    AND HANDLING CHARGES, WHICH ARE USUALLY MUCH GREATER THAN THE PRICE OF
      THE CRYSTAL.  IT'S BEST TO GET SEVERAL PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SHARE THE
     S&H COST.  OR, BUY FIVE OR SIX YOURSELF AND SELL THEM LATER.  SOME OF
                    THE PLACES YOU CAN ORDER CRYSTALS ARE:

       RED BOXES WILL WORK ON TELCO OWNED PAYPHONES, BUT NOT ON COCOT'S
                  (CUSTOMER OWNED COIN OPERATED TELEPHONES).

     BLUE BOXES USE A 2600HZ TONE TO CONVINCE TELEPHONE SWITCHES THAT USE
     IN-BAND SIGNALLING THAT THE CALLER IS ACTUALLY A TELEPHONE OPERATOR.

      THE CALLER MAY THEN ACCESS SPECIAL SWITCH FUNCTIONS, WITH THE USUAL
          PURPOSE OF MAKING FREE LONG DISTANCE PHONE CALLS, USING THE
                MULTI-FREQUENCY TONES PROVIDED BY THE BLUE BOX.

    BLUE BOXES STILL WORK IN AREAS USING IN-BAND SIGNALLING.  MODERN PHONE
       SIGNALLING SWITCHES USING ESS (ELECTRONIC SIGNALLING SYSTEMS) USE
      OUT-OF-BAND-SIGNALLING.  NOTHING YOU SEND OVER THE VOICE PORTION OF
                       BANDWIDTH CAN CONTROL THE SWITCH.

      A BLACK BOX IS A 1.8K OHM RESISTOR PLACED ACROSS YOUR PHONE LINE TO
    CAUSE THE PHONE COMPANY EQUIPMENT TO BE UNABLE TO DETECT THAT YOU HAVE
     ANSWERED YOUR TELEPHONE.  PEOPLE WHO CALL YOU WILL THEN NOT BE BILLED
          FOR THE TELEPHONE CALL.  BLACK BOXES DO NOT WORK UNDER ESS.

     AN ANAC (AUTOMATIC NUMBER ANNOUNCEMENT CIRCUIT) NUMBER IS A TELEPHONE
      NUMBER THAT PLAYS BACK THE NUMBER OF THE TELEPHONE THAT CALLED IT.
     ANAC NUMBERS ARE CONVENIENT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TELEPHONE NUMBER
                              OF A PAIR OF WIRES.

                         HOW TO FIND YOUR ANAC NUMBER:
                                       
    LOOK UP YOUR NPA (AREA CODE) AND TRY THE NUMBER LISTED FOR IT. IF THAT
      FAILS, TRY 1 PLUS THE NUMBER LISTED FOR IT.  IF THAT FAILS, TRY THE
     COMMON NUMBERS LIKE 311, 958 AND 200-222-2222.  IF YOU FIND THE ANAC
                   NUMBER FOR YOUR AREA, PLEASE LET US KNOW.

               HANG UP.  YOU WILL BE CALLED BACK SECONDS LATER.
                                       
                                       
                 12. WHAT IS THE RINGBACK NUMBER FOR MY AREA?
                                       
    AN 'X' MEANS INSERT THOSE NUMBERS FROM THE PHONE NUMBER FROM WHICH YOU
    ARE CALLING.  A '?' MEANS THAT THE NUMBER VARIES FROM SWITCH TO SWITCH
         IN THE AREA, OR CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME.  TRY ALL POSSIBLE
                                 COMBINATIONS.
                                       
      IF THE RINGBACK FOR YOUR NPA IS NOT LISTED, TRY COMMON ONES SUCH AS
     954, 957 AND 958.  ALSO, TRY USING THE NUMBERS LISTED FOR OTHER NPA'S
                       SERVED BY YOUR TELEPHONE COMPANY.

         THIS FAQ ANSWER IS EXCERPTED FROM: TONELOC V0.99 USER MANUAL

     LOOPS ARE A PAIR OF PHONE NUMBERS, USUALLY CONSECUTIVE, LIKE 836-9998
     AND 836-9999.  THEY ARE USED BY THE PHONE COMPANY FOR TESTING.  WHAT
      GOOD DO LOOPS DO US?  WELL, THEY ARE COOL IN A FEW WAYS.  HERE IS A
       SIMPLE USE OF LOOPS.  EACH LOOP HAS TWO ENDS, A 'HIGH' END, AND A
     'LOW' END.  ONE END GIVES A (USUALLY) CONSTANT, LOUD TONE WHEN IT IS
      CALLED. THE OTHER END IS SILENT.  LOOPS DON'T USUALLY RING EITHER.

                                                            #hack FAQ (77/3114)
      WHEN BOTH ENDS ARE CALLED, THE PEOPLE THAT CALLED EACH END CAN TALK
        THROUGH THE LOOP.  SOME LOOPS ARE VOICE FILTERED AND WON'T PASS
      ANYTHING BUT A CONSTANT TONE; THESE AREN'T MUCH USE TO YOU.  HERE'S
    WHAT YOU CAN USE WORKING LOOPS FOR:  BILLING PHONE CALLS!  FIRST, CALL
      THE END THAT GIVES THE LOUD TONE.  THEN IF THE OPERATOR OR SOMEONE
     CALLS THE OTHER END, THE TONE WILL GO QUIET.  ACT LIKE THE PHONE JUST
      RANG AND YOU ANSWERED IT ... SAY "HELLO", "ALLO", "CHOW", "YO", OR
    WHAT THE FUCK EVER.  THE OPERATOR THINKS THAT SHE JUST CALLED YOU, AND
      THAT'S IT!  NOW THE PHONE BILL WILL GO TO THE LOOP, AND YOUR LOCAL
    RBOC WILL GET THE BILL!  USE THIS TECHNIQUE IN MODERATION, OR THE LOOP
     MAY GO DOWN.  LOOPS ARE PROBABLY MOST USEFUL WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK TO
           SOMEONE TO WHOM YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

        MANY OF THESE LOOPS ARE NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL.  IF YOU ARE LOCAL
      TO ANY OF THESE LOOPS, PLEASE TRY THEM OUT AN E-MAIL ME THE RESULTS
                               OF YOUR RESEARCH.

     CNA STANDS FOR CUSTOMER NAME AND ADDRESS.  THE CNA NUMBER IS A PHONE
      NUMBER FOR TELEPHONE COMPANY PERSONNEL TO CALL AND GET THE NAME AND
    ADDRESS FOR A PHONE NUMBER.  IF A TELEPHONE LINEMAN FINDS A PHONE LINE
      HE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE, HE CAN USE THE ANI NUMBER TO FIND IT'S PHONE
      NUMBER AND THEN CALL THE CNA OPERATOR TO SEE WHO OWNS IT AND WHERE
                                  THEY LIVE.
                                       
     NORMAL CNA NUMBERS ARE AVAILABLE ONLY TO TELEPHONE COMPANY PERSONNEL.
       PRIVATE CITIZENS MAY NOW LEGALLY GET CNA INFORMATION FROM PRIVATE

                             19. WHAT IS SCANNING?
                                       
      SCANNING IS DIALING A LARGE NUMBER OF TELEPHONE NUMBERS IN THE HOPE
             OF FINDING INTERESTING CARRIERS (COMPUTERS) OR TONES.
                                       
        SCANNING CAN BE DONE BY HAND, ALTHOUGH DIALING SEVERAL THOUSAND
     TELEPHONE NUMBERS BY HAND IS EXTREMELY BORING AND TAKES A LONG TIME.
                                       
       MUCH BETTER IS TO USE A SCANNING PROGRAM, SOMETIMES CALLED A WAR
      DIALER OR A DEMON DIALER.  CURRENTLY, THE BEST WAR DIALER AVAILABLE
                       TO PC-DOS USERS IS TONELOC .99B8.
                                       
      A WAR DIALER WILL DIAL A RANGE OF NUMBERS AND LOG WHAT IT FINDS AT

       EACH NUMBER.  YOU CAN THEN ONLY DIAL UP THE NUMBERS THAT THE WAR
                      DIALER MARKED AS CARRIERS OR TONES.
                                       
                                       
                           20. IS SCANNING ILLEGAL?

                                     -BQ-
      IN SOME PLACES, SCANNING HAS BEEN MADE ILLEGAL.  IT WOULD BE HARD,
    THOUGH, FOR SOMEONE TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU FOR SCANNING SINCE
      THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO CALL EVERY NUMBER ONCE AND ONLY ONCE.  IT'S
     NOT LIKELY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS HARASSMENT BY ANYONE WHO GETS A SINGLE
     PHONE CALL FROM A SCANNING COMPUTER.  SOME CENTRAL OFFICES HAVE BEEN
    KNOWN TO REACT STRANGELY WHEN PEOPLE START SCANNING.  SOMETIMES YOU'RE
       UNABLE TO GET A DIALTONE FOR HOURS AFTER YOU START SCANNING.  BUT
    THERE IS NO UNIFORM POLICY.  THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO FIRST FIND OUT
        IF YOU'VE GOT SOME CRAZY LAW SAYING YOU CAN'T DO IT.  IF, AS IS
    LIKELY, THERE IS NO SUCH LAW, THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS IS
                               TO GIVE IT A TRY.

      IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A LAW MAKING SCANNING ILLEGAL WAS RECENTLY
      PASSED IN COLORADO SPRINGS, CO.  IT IS NOW ILLEGAL TO PLACE A CALL
            IN COLORADO SPRINGS WITHOUT THE INTENT TO COMMUNICATE.

   LINE AT THE PROPER TIME, ONE COULD GET AWAY WITH ALL SORTS OF FUN STUFF.

        STEP TOWARDS EXPLORING THE NETWORK.  IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL AT
         GETTING A TOLL CALL TO DROP, THEN BILLING WOULD STOP AT THAT
        POINT BUT THERE WOULD BE BILLING FOR THE NUMBER ALREADY DIALED
         UP UNTIL THE POINT OF SEIZURE.  800 NUMBERS AND LONG DISTANCE
       INFORMATION WERE BOTH FREE IN THE PAST AND RECORDS OF WHO CALLED
         WHAT WERE EITHER NON-EXISTENT OR VERY OBSCURE WITH REGARDS TO
         THESE NUMBERS.  THIS, NATURALLY, MADE THEM MORE POPULAR THAN
           NUMBERS THAT SHOWED UP ON A BILL, EVEN IF IT WAS ONLY FOR
        A MINUTE.  TODAY, MANY 800 NUMBERS GO OVERSEAS, WHICH PROVIDES
           A QUICK AND FREE WAY INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY'S PHONE SYSTEM
                   WHICH MAY BE MORE OPEN FOR EXPLORATION."

        THINK 2600 SHOULD BE IN THE BOOKSTORE.  BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE
                         BOOKSTORES NAME AND ADDRESS.
                                       
                                       
    05. WHY DOES 2600 COST MORE TO SUBSCRIBE TO THAN TO BUY AT A NEWSSTAND?
                                       
                        A NOTE FROM EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN:
                                       
       WE'VE BEEN SELLING 2600 AT THE SAME NEWSSTAND PRICE ($4) SINCE 1988
       AND WE HOPE TO KEEP IT AT THAT PRICE FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN GET AWAY
        WITH IT. AT THE SAME TIME, $21 IS ABOUT THE RIGHT PRICE TO COVER
       SUBSCRIBER COSTS, INCLUDING POSTAGE AND RECORD KEEPING, ETC. PEOPLE
       WHO SUBSCRIBE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FINDING AN ISSUE SOMEPLACE,
         THEY TEND TO GET ISSUES SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THE NEWSSTANDS GET
          THEM, AND THEY CAN TAKE OUT FREE ADS IN THE 2600 MARKETPLACE.
                                       
       THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY.  THE NY TIMES, FOR
     EXAMPLE, COSTS $156.50 AT THE NEWSSTANDS, AND $234.75 DELIVERED TO YOUR
                                      DOOR.

     FOR A CARD WITH AN EVEN NUMBER OF DIGITS, DOUBLE EVERY ODD DIGIT AND
      SUBTRACT 9 IF THE PRODUCT IS GREATER THAN 10.  ADD UP ALL THE EVEN
      DIGITS AS WELL AS THE DOUBLED-ODD DIGITS, AND THE RESULT MUST BE A
       MULTIPLE OF 10 OR IT'S NOT A VALID CARD.  IF THE CARD HAS AN ODD
     NUMBER OF DIGITS, PERFORM THE SAME ADDITION DOUBLING THE EVEN DIGITS
