                             The Basics of TELENET
                                     Part I

  This Bulletin is the first in a series to cover the general procedures of the
major data networks:

Telenet
Tymnet
Autonet
Arpanet
[More to be added]


                                   BACKGROUND
                                   ----------
  Telenet connects many large computers to itself through dedicated telephone
lines, each of these 'host computers' is assigned a node address(ie.:NPAxx).
Telenet is an international data network, connecting to computers around the
world.See the International telenet bulletin for more on this.

                                   CONNECTING
                                   ----------
  Telenet is probably the most 'user friendly' network of the four listed.  A
normal logon looks like this:  [NPA=Area code,xx=node address] You hit <CR>
<CR> [2 Returns] Telenet respnds with:TELENET NPAxx

TERMINAL=(Here you type your terminal identifier) (See the bulletin section for
       the list)

             @

  The '@' is Telenet's promt to you to go ahead.

                            Things to do on telenet
                            -----------------------
  To connect to a node type:
                        @C NPAxx
  Telenet will atempt to connect to the computer at the node given.
  A few of the things that Telenet will say are:


NPAxx CONNECTED (You are connected to a computer)
ILLEGAL ADDRESS (Not a working node)
NPAxx NOT REACHABLE   (The computer at that node is 'DOWN')
NPAxx REFUSED  COLLECT CONNECTION(Needs a paid ID [More later]
NPAxx REJECTING (Computer is 'UP' but not available)
NPAxx NOT RESPONDING (The computer at that node is 'DOWN')

  These are most of the things that Telenet will tell you

                               MORE THINGS TO DO
                               -----------------
  Typing an @ while in a host computer will return you to Telenet You will
still be connected to the other computer, you may:  D (to disconnect from that
computer) or TAPE (Unknown, possibly records your actions so that) (you may
look at them later)

  If you type either of the above, while not connected to a node telenet will
respond with NOT CONNECTED

                                     MISC.
                                     -----
RESET (Returns Telenet to the beggining,you must start again (with the
      <CR><CR>)

SET (Unknown)

MAIL (To connect to GTE Telemail) It will ask for User?  and Password?


                                     NOTES
                                     -----

  In addition to the normal area codes in NPAxx there are also other NPA's used
in Telenet, 909 and 311, for instance.

  Telenet hangs up after three disconnections from host computers, this
unfortunately is quite a PAIN in the ___ There is no way to get around this as
far as I can tell.

  The ID command in Telenet is to Identify users to the host computers.  You
must type ID (your ID#) (your password).  If you just type ID, telenet will
tell you that your ID is cleared, which means nothing.  To recieve a paid user
ID on telenet call them at:  Telenet customer service:800-336-0437 800-572-
0408(In Virginia)


                                    HACKING
                                    -------
  Telenet is very convinient for hackers as it connects many computers to your
terminal, without having to find and dial many numbers.  Start your Telehacking
by picking an areacode and then trying all the nodes in that NPA.  You will no
doubt find many interesting computers 'to work on'.

   Here are instructions for using TELENET.  There are some very basic things,
which most people already know, and some other things, which even the most
dedicated hackers have probably never even heard of.  This includes things such
as international access, etc.  Well, have fun.


                    THE TELENET CONNECTION
      INTERNATIONAL ADDRESSING/INTERNATIONAL ACCESS PROCEDURES


I.  TELENET INTERNATIONAL ADDRESS FORMAT

    ---------------------------- Data Network
    |                       Identification Code (DNIC)
    |
    |
    |
    |      ------------------- Area Code
    |      |
    |      |
    |      |    ------------- DTE Address
    |      |    |
    |      |    |      ----- Port Address
    |      |    |      |
    |      |    |      |
  DDDD    AAA  HHHHH   PP
                       |
                       ----- Optional Subaddress
                            Field for Packet Mode DTE


Example:  Telenet        International
        -------         -------------
        212 141         3110 21200141
        909  84         3110 90900084



II.   ACCESS TO OVERSEAS PUBLIC DATA NETWORKS

1.  Turn on the terminal and coupler.
2.  Dial the nearest Telenet access number (See Telenet Public Dial listing).
    When you hear a high-pitched tone, place the telephone
    receiver in the coupler.

     For Data Sets (Bell 103 or 113 type), depress the data button.

3.  Type Two carriage returns (CR).
4.  Telenet will give you a port identification number and ask you
    to identify your terminal type in the two or four
    character id for your terminal followed by a carriage
    return (CR) or type carriage return (CR).

      (EX.)   TELENET
             202 DL9
             TERMINAL = AJ63(CR)

5.  After Telenet prompts with a '@' type 'ID', skip a space (SP)
    and type your password followed by a carriage return.  (Contact
    your GTE Telenet Representative to obtain a required caller
    paid ID.)

      (EX.)   @ID(SP);INTL(CR)

    Type in your password.

      (EX.)   PASSWORD = 123456(CR)

6.  After Telenet prompts with an @, type a C. skip a space and
    type the network address of the computer you wish to access,
    followed by a carriage return (CR).

      (EX.)   @C(SP)023411234567890(CR)

    Note:  Your International address will follow a format such as:

         020801234567890 for France/Transpac
         023421234567890 for United Kingdom/British Telecom
         026241234567890 for Germany/Datex-P

7.  Telenet will respond with a connection message.  You are now
    ready to begin your conversation with the host computer.

      (EX.)   (ADDRESS)CONNECTED

8.  To disconnect from your computer, log off as usual.  Telenet
    will send you a disconnected message.

      (EX.)   (ADDRESS)DISCONNECTED

    Hang up to disconnect from Telenet.

(CR) = Carriage return
(SP) = Space
