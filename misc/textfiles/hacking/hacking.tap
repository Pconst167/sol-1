Many of us out there think of ourselves as hackers but what is a REAL
hacker....Well for those of you out there that play with college computers
and local schools.... you are nothing !!  The making of a real hacker is
being able to find a 'virgin' system and breking in and really doing
someting to it...Hacking is not a term to be used lightly....Not only
that but hacking is also something not to be taking lightly and
flagrently....The reason for hacking....Well you don't hack into a
computer just to wreck it or to destoy it even though it is phun, the
reason to hack into a computer is to learn from it and conquer it... The
idea of actually entering a system, without authorization is life line
of hacking....those out there who know what hacking is knows what to do and
what not to do but what are the basic rules......Well... here's a short
more or less complete list of do's and don'ts on hacking:

I. Do not purposely destroy a system -- What's the use of destorying a
   system anyone....after it's destruction a system is no good and can
   serve you no real purpose

II. Do not leave real names or real handles anywhere on a system -- This is
    the most important thing to remember....you might want to be recognized
    for breaking a system but a signature or trademark can only mean your
    apprehension

III. Do not under no circumstance hack a system directly -- If you really
     plan on hacking a system by running a program or script doing it
     direct could be dangerous if someone see's you attempting to hack
     your call be CAN be traced...The best thing to do in this situation is
     to use a PBX or a outdial of some sort

IV. Do not mess with accounts or defaults -- No matter what kind of urge
    you get , by messing with someones account or messing with the system
    defaults will let the business notice the intrusion of an outside
    presence which more or less means a termination of your access

V. Do not mess with anything you don't know -- Don't go around the system
   trying junk you don't understand cause this can only lead to you messing
   up the system or getting caught

VI. Hack during the out of work hours -- By hacking late at night or early
    in the morning to can escape the chances of someone watching you

VII. Do not post your findings on local boards -- Do not post up new stuff
     you find unless you really want swarms of people at it....A very
     important thing to control is the urge to brag about systems you find
     but this could lead to an abuse of the system which in turn leads to
     the system shutdown....Don't get me wrong about not sharing knowledge
     but you don't want to send something public unless you have made sure
     that you have done all you wanted to do with the system

That's more or less what you don't what to do....things you might want
to do is:

I. Set up a account for yourself -- By setting up an account for yourself
   it will elimanate the chores of finding a backdoor to the system

II. Leech files -- Another thing that should be done if possible is to
    get as many 'interesting' files as you can since they could be useful
    in later hacking quests

III. Fix the security -- If you get a system that has a 'drop' password
     you should really try to fix it so there is none to make life easier
     for the following hackers who attempt to infiltrate the system

IV. Keep track of the system -- No matter how dumg the system might be
    or how impossible the security is you should always keep track of
    all numbers you have

V. Look for interestin items in the system -- Keep an eye for stuff that
   resembles passwords or other numbers since this could lead to new
   systems or usable passwords

That more or less covers that....BUT how do you find 'virgin' systems? Well
this is a part of hacking that all hackers most do....scanning...Scanning
or wardialing was brought to life by the popular hacker movie 'Wargames'
which inspired the war games wardialer....what a wardial or scanner does
is it goes thru all the numbers in a specified prefix.....A good wardialer
or scanner should be able to go thru numbers and be able to store them in
a file which you can go thru later when you're bored....The idea is to find
system beloning to companies and business....it's a good idea to find out
a prefix to lets say your downtown area...

Another thing that most companies also have is frequecies hooked up to
computers... This is a lot tuffer to scan for since you would nee to set up
a HAM radio to go thru frequencies and collect infomation on what
frequencies have carriers on the other ends...This is a fairly difficult
thing to do but he rewards could be great....the most importan thing to
remeber is to scan with the HAM in you car or something.....scanning from
a fixed location will only cause police and FBI to show up at your doorsteps..

When you've located a system don;t get discouraged if you get no response...
many system think that if they set it up to connect at wierd parity's or
stop bits and baud rate it's all the security so it is very important to
find a communication program that will allow to do wierd things such as
connecting at 1100 bauds and 1800 bauds....also to be able to set the parity
to mark and space...

Well I hope this phile helps you starters...I'm going to crash now I've
done my good deed for the day....well keep hacking but remember to hack
safe!
