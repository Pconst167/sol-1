 The following information is from the AUSTPAC character
terminal manual. 
 Austpac is available all the time except (currently) 11pm Thu
- 7am Fri. This is their maintainance window. (Melb. time).
When you don't include an NUI in a call request it will perform
reverse charges, if the called system allows.
 ADDRESSING : There are 2 formats of this in call requests,
long and short.
o Long format address: Used in international destinations and
some national ones.
           DNIC
     ---------------
     I             I
 P     DCC     R       NTN     SS
            I---------------I
DNIC = data network identifier code (X.121) (5052 for austpac)
DCC  = data country code (X.121)
NN   = national number (X.121)
R    = network identifier (2 for austpac)
SS   = optional sub address (0,1 or 2 digits)
NTN  = terminal identifier (8 digits)
P    = international prefix (0 for austpac)
  In the long format the total number of digits i the called
address field must be <= 15.      .....cont next mesg.
o Short form addressing : This is only used for national
destinations
    R       NTN     SSSSSS
  I---------------I
        NN
 The constituent fields of the national number (NN) are the
same for the long format except for the subaddress field:
 SSSSSS Optional subaddress (0-6 digits)
 The length limitaions of the field is <=15 (same for long)
INTERNATIONAL PACKET SWITCHING NETWORKS which may be called
from austpac.

PAD (packet assembly/disassembly) is used because char terms
(us) can't handle packets. There are currently 18 parameters.
#1    PAD recall using a character. This is the char to change
      from transfer to command mode.
      0  not possible

#2    Echo of characters by PAD
      0  no echo
      1  echo
#3 Selection of data forwarding signals. This is the char(s) 
   that when received take chars in PAD buffer and assembles
   it into a packet.

   terminal x-on/x-off.
   0  no use of x-on (DC1,CTRL Q) & x-off (DC3,CTRL S)
   1  use x-on/x-off
#6 Control of PAD service signals. Determines whether PAD 
   indecations are sent to char term.

      are transmitted.
#7 Selection of operation of PAD on receipt of break signal
   from the char term.
   0 nothing
   1 interrupt
   2 reset

#12 Flow control of PAD. Determines whether char term can
    suspend output with x-on/x-off
    0 no use of x-on/x-off (CTRL Q & S)
    1 use of x-on/x-off
#13 LF insertion after CR.
    0 no LF
    1 insert LF after CR
    4 insert LF after echo of CR to char term
    5 insert LF after transmissionto the char term and after
      echo of CR
    6 insert LF in data stream after CR from char term and
      after echo of a CR to the char term
    7 insert LF in data stream to and from char term and after
      echo of a CR to char term
#14 Padding after LF
    0 no padding after LF
    1-7 # of padding chars inserted after LF (applies only to
        data transfer mode)
#15 Editing.
    0 no use of editing in data transfer mode
    1 use of editing in data tranfer mode
#16 Character delete.
    0-127 one char from IA5
    8 char <BS> (default)
#17 Line delete.
    0-127 one char from IA5
    24    char <CAN> (default)
#18 Line display.
    0-127 one char from IA5
    42    char <*> (default)
--------------------------------------
IA5 = CCITT international alphabet # 5 (approx ASCII)
char term = C-DTE (officially) = out computer terminal
 The above parameters are changable by the user. If you have
an NUI then the default can be different to normal. A profile
is a snap-shot of all the params. There are 18 I won't type
them all out take too long. PSTN (us) customers are usually
assigned profile 0 (up to 300 or 1200 bit/s). Videotex
(1200/75) use profile 9.
Profile #                   Param #
          I 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15

If you look and think you'll realize that param 11 (speed)
cannot be set by the user.
COMMANDS :
  The PAD is either in command or data transfer mode. To get
from data to command you use the pad recall char (CTRL P unless
you changed it!) or in some circumstances a BREAK signal is
used.
 COMMAND     FUNCTION
--------------------------
STAT   to request info about a virtual call with char term
       (FREE or ENGAGED)
CLR    to clear a virtual call (CLF CONF or CLR ERR)
PAR? <list of params> Request values of all params in list
                      and requst current value (no list=all)
SET? <list of params&value) Requst setting of param to new
                            value.
PROF identifier      Use profile to set params.
RESET       reset the virtual call
INT         transmit an interrupt packet to the correspondent
SET <list of params&value> As above except doesn't request 
                           current values.
CALL REQUEST (see later)   set up a virtual call.
-------------------------
In the previous command list the ones above PROF need a
response. PROF and below the only response is the
ACKNOWLEDGMENT indication of <CR><LF>
examples of these commands would be :
PROF 10
SET 2:0,5:4
SET?3:0
PAR?1,5,8 or PAR?
STAT
 Normal access numbers are
 01921 - 110,150,200,300 bit/s    profile 0
 01922 - 1200 bit/s               profile 0
 01923 - 1200/75 bit/s videotex   profile 9
*profile 9 is not available to user accessing with # 01921 or
01922.
 Videotext users : call requests may be preceeded by <?> or <*>
and all commands including call request can be terminated by
<CR> <+> or <#>
 
In the next couple of messages network responses and call
requests!
O.K for those who have access to
minerva and dont know how to access
telenet , tymnet .....ect...ect
well try this
at the @ prompt type this....
@ C :0311030100055 -FCTY
got it now.......
check ya!!
Network responses and error messages.
-------------------------------------
CLR OCC  called number occupied
CLR INV  invalid facilty requested
CLR ERR  a local procedure error has been detected
CLR PAD  PAD has cleared the call at the invitation of the
         remote char term
RESET(cause)  reset of the virtual call
CLR NA   network congestion
CLR NA   access not permitted
CLR NP   called number not assigned
CLR DER  called number out of order
CLR RNA  called number does not subscribe to reverse charging
CLR RPE  a procedure error has been detected at the remote DTE
         network interface
CLR ID   the call is not compatible with the remote destination
CLR CONF clear command from the local char term acknowledged
CLR DTE  remote DTE cleared the call
AUSTPAC  terminal connected to austpac PAD
COM      call connected
 The number which often follows the above is a diagnotic code
used when finding faults.
Before I continue there is a small error in the last message
the first CLR NA in the list should be CLR NC.....sorry
CALL REQUEST FORMATS
--------------------
call request to austpac customer (automatic reverse charging
request)
?<austpac number><CR>      eg. ?288888888 <CR>
call request to austpac customer using NUI
?N <NUI> - <austpac> <CR>    where NUI is your own 12 char
                             alpha-numeric code.Chars after N
                             are not echoed until the -
eg. ?NUSERIDENTITY-288888888 <CR>
call request to a user in another country
?N <NUI> -0 <international #> <CR>
eg. ?NUSERIDENTITY-0888888888888888 <CR>
2 other command which may be used in call requests are R and
Gnn where R is for reverse charging and Gnn is a closed user
group and nn being the local reference number.
eg. ?G03,R,NUSERIDENTITY-236021234PSECRET99<CR>
A user data or password field may follow the address
the password is prefixed with P and the data is prefixed with D
by the user (you). You cannot have data and password and the
information is passed on to the destination system (I think)
eg. ? G03 , R, N USERIDENTITY - 236021234 P SECRET99<CR>
    ? G03,R, N USERIDENTITY -23602123 D ANYTHING<CR>
the data or password length may be up to 12 alpha-numer chars
As you would have seen spaces may be included for clarity.
These have no effect.
 
Well that wraps up all the info (summary) in 'Asynchronous
Character Mode Service (X.28) User Guide' it is an AUSTPAC
manual which is plastic spiral bound. If you don't want all the
parameter trash I recommend you read the first message or two
and messages 12 and 13. Well that's it. If you read it all or
downloaded/printed it, drop me a line, I'd like to know how
many people were interested. Until next time this is Captain
Hack signing off. Have fun and happy hacking AUSTPAC.
