     AS MOST OF YOU ALREADY KNOW, TYMNET IS AN INFORMATION SYSTEM ACCESSABLE
BY COMPUTERS WITH MODEMS FROM ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.  TYMNET
INCLUDES MANY SUB-SYSTEMS OF INFORMATION WHICH CAN BE USEFUL FOR BUSINESSES
OR JUST PHUN.  ONE SUB-SYSTEM WHICH I WILL WRITE A SEPARATE ARTICLE ON IS
THE ATP CO'S ELECTRONIC TARIFF SYSTEM.  BUT FOR NOW, I'LL MAKE ALL OF YOU
EXPERTS IN TYMNET SO YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH PHUN AS YOURS TRUELY.
 
 ACCESS NUMBERS
 --------------

     FOR YOUR LOCAL ACCESS NUMBER YOU COULD CALL THE NICE PERSON AT
800-336-0149 AND REQUEST IT FOR YOUR AREA.  IF YOU LIVE NEAR A METROPOLITAN
AREA ASK FOR THAT AREA CODE SINCE THEY RARELY HAVE ACCESS NUMBERS FOR
OUT-OF-CITY AREAS.  FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE 914 AREA YOU CAN USE:
 
 POUGHKEEPSIE : 914-473-0401
 WHITE PLAINS : 914-684-6075
 
 LOGGING IN TO TYMNET
 --------------------

1. WHEN YOU HAVE CONNECTED WITH THE NETWORK, THE FOLLOWING REQUEST WILL BE
   DISPLAYED:
 
PLEASE TYPE YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER
 
ENTER YOUR TERM. IDENTIFIER ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING CHART:
 
KEY: IDENT  = IDENTIFIER
.    ASC    = ASCII
.    EBCD   = EBCD CORRESPONDENCE
.    <R>    = CARRIAGE RETURN
 
     SPEEDS ARE GIVEN IN CPS (CHARACTERS PER-SECOND). TO TRANSLATE TO BAUD
RATE JUST MULTIPLY BY 10.
- More (Y/N/NS)? 
 
IDENT  CODE  SPEED   TERMINAL TYPE
-----  ----  -----   -------------
. A    ASC   30,120  PERSONAL COMP.
                     WITH CRT
 
[MOST EVERYBODY AT HOME WILL USE THIS OPTION SO IF YOU AREN'T SURE USE A]
 
. B    ASC   15      ALL TERMINALS
 
. C    ASC   30      IMPACT PRINTERS
 
. D    ASC   10      ALL TERMINALS

            30 OUT
 
. G    ASC  30,120    BELT PRINTERS
.                     G.E. TERMINET

. P<R> EBCD 14.8      SELECTRIC-TYPE
.                     TERMINALS
.                     (E.G., 2741)
 
 
     IF THE MESSAGE DOES NOT APPEAR JUST WAIT A FEW SECONDS THEN ENTER IT.
NOTE THAT ONLY P IDENTIFIERS NEED A <R> THEM BUT SINCE MOST OF YOU WON'T BE
USING P FORGET IT.
 
2. TYMNET WILL THEN DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF THE REMOTE ACCESS NODE TO WHICH
   YOU ARE CONNECTED, FOLLOWED BY THE NUMBER OF YOUR PORT ON THE NODE, AND
   WILL DISPLAY THIS REQUEST:
 
.  -NNNN-PPP-
.  PLEASE LOG IN:
 
3. TYPE YOUR USER NAME AND <R> THIS USER NAME SEEMS TO BE THE ABBREVIATION
   FOR THE COMPANY WHO OWNS THE SUB-SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR ELECTRONIC
   TARIFF THE USER NAME IS ATP WHICH STANDS FOR AIRLINE TARIFF PUBLISHING,
   THE COMPANY THAT RUNS THE ELECTRONIC TARIFF.
- More (Y/N/NS)? 
 
4. TYMNET WILL THEN REQUEST:
 
.  PASSWORD:
 
   TYPE YOUR PASSWORD AND <R>. THE PASSWORD MAY NOT BE DISPLAYED ON YOUR
   SCREEN.
 
5. TYMNET WILL THEN DISPLAY SOME CHARACTER OR MESSAGE INDICATING THAT YOU
   HAVE LOGGED ON.
 
     SINCE BUSINESSES DON'T REALLY GET COMPLICATED WITH PASSWORDS AND THE
SUCH, JUST ENTER VALID USER NAMES AND FOR PASSWORDS YOU CAN FORGET
CTRL-CHARACTERS. PASSWORDS HAVE A LENGTH OF 8 CHARACTERS (AS FAR AS I KNOW).
 
 TYMNET CONTROL CHARACTERS
 -------------------------
 
 CTRL-CHAR    OPERATION
 --------     ---------
 . H         HALF-DUPLEX

 ACCESSING DATAPAC
 -----------------

     THE STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR ACCESSING A HOST ON THE DATAPAC NETWORK IS
DESCRIBED BELOW.  TYMNET'S INFORMATION DIRECTORY INCLUDES FILES OF MATERIAL
ABOUT DATAPAC AND TYMNET'S INTERNATIONAL SERVICES.
 
 LOGGING IN TO DATAPAC
 ---------------------

1. DIAL-UP TYMNET (SEE ABOVE)

2. ENTER YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER
 
3. AT THE "PLEASE LOG IN:" PROMPT, ENTER THE LOG-IN COMMAND, SPECIFYING:
   THE DATAPAC NETWORK (DPAC), A SEMICOLON (A SECOND SEMICOLON WILL ECHO AT
   YOUR END) , THE DATAPAC NETWORK IDENTIFICATION CODE (3020), THE 8-DIGIT
   HOST ADDRESS AND <R>.
 
E.G., DPAC;;3020HOST ADDRESS <R>
 
   IF YOU NEED TO ENTER FUTHER USER DATA ENTER A COLON AFTER THE HOST
ADDRESS THEN A <R>.
 
E.G., DPAC;;3020HOST ADDRESS:USER DATA
.     <R>
 
5. DATAPAC WILL THEN DISPLAY A MESSAGE OR CHARACTER TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE
   ON-LINE.
 
     THIS LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION SHOULD GET SOME OF YOU GOING.  MY
