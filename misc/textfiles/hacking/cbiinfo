CBI is a credit referral service, similar to TRW (though rather inferior).  
Basically, with the advent of large-scale credit use for high-end purchases, a 
need arose for a service which various businesses, banks, lending agents etc. 
could quickly and easily get a complete credit history on a potential customer.
Thus, these establishments can have at their beck and call your entire credit 
history: all your credit cards, their limits, any mortgages you have and their 
current status, as well as various other tidbits such as loans, car reposses-
sion defaulted extensions of credit, and the like.  Some peoples credit files 
are quite extensive, while others are surprisingly incomplete.  This, I sup-
pose, reflects the ammount of credit usage the individual in question has 
employed.  To make these credit referral services quickly and easily accessi-
ble, these companies have been kind enough to place all their records in an 
online databasewhich can be called and referenced by a legitimate account-
holder via modem.  Forutunately for us, the hacker community, this wonderful 
database can also be  called and accessed illegally.  THAT is where the phun 
begins.

PART 3: Okay, how do I get on?
To make the lives of the various legal users of their system easier, CBI has  
established numerous access points to their database. Unfortunately, at the 
timeof the writing of this phile, I only have two working dialup for CBI. They 
are: 1-713-591-8100  Houston, Texas
     1-804-466-1619  Norfolk, Virginia
Also, the voiceline for CBI's 'Equifax Credit Information Services' is 
1-201-842-7500. Call it and social engineer yourself a dialup or six.  Once 
you're ready to call, TAKE PRECAUTIONS. NEVER call a CBI dialup directly, or 
just through a code. ESPECIALLY if you're trying to hack out an account. 
Rather, use an outdial, or better yet, use several outdials. Make it HARD for
them to track you down. ATTHEVERY LEAST, use a diverter. I usually use a single
outdial, which seems to be safe enough for simply accessing the system.  
As I said, for hacking, a more 'layered' approach is advisable.  Okay, so now 
you've dialed the number from your cheesy outdial. The system connects. But, 
nothing appears on your screen. CBI does not recognize the standard 'carriage 
return' generated by your 'return' key. Rather, CBI accepts [cntrl-s] (^s) as 
a return. So, to awaken the system, hit cntrl-s (you may need to follow this 
with a return sometimes). Wait a few seconds and you'll see:(LA)PLEASE SIGN-ON:
The system has no echo, so you may want to call with half duplex for some 
visualre-assurance. You now enter your account. Accounts appear in two formats:
613bb2114-c2    OR    613bb2114-c2,az,p.
The system will accept either one (ie, the 'az,p.' is not necessary). After you
finish typing in the account, hit [cntrl-s] again. There will be a few seconds
brief wait, and if the account you entered is valid, the system will say:
Blammo. You're in.

PART 4: How to pull files
Once you're in, there are 2 BASIC commands that you need to know to pull      
peoples files. There are various other commands for more powerful accounts, but
as a low end user, you need not worry about these, and if you area a more
experienced user, then you don't need ME to tell them to you!
The files in the CBI database are referenced by either name and address or    
social security number. If you know either of these for your prospective 
target,you're in business. First, the easy one: To pull a persons credit file 
with their SS number, enter this command:         
id-sss-###-##-####.[cntrl-s]
Where #'s are the digits of the SS #. Do not forget the period at the end of 
thecommand, it IS necessary. Also, remember to enter the command with controls,
NOT return.
Next, the more useful method of pulling a file. Enter the following:
nm-first,last.ca-house #,streetname,streettype,town,state,zipcode.[cntrl-s]
As for the name, you MUST have the full last name, but you only need to enter
the first initial or a partial name. For the address, spelling the streetname
and town correctly are important. Also, the zipcode is NOT NECESSARY. You can
just put the period after the state and hit ^s. Streettype refers to blvd, st,
rd, ln, ct...etc, you get the idea...you can either spell it out or use the
common abbreviation. For towns or streets with 2 words, ie 'Seaside Heights'
enter it exactly as is, for example:
nm-lamer,joe.ca-666,wanker,ln,seaside heights,nj.^s

PART 5: What's this weird number shit?
When you successfully pull a file, you'll see something like this:            
*WAD,DICK   SINCE 08/24/85  FAD 07/09/90          FN-300
72B,WOMBAT,BV,SCROTUM,SD,01010,TAPE RPTD 07/85
223,DERF,DR,TESTICLE,TX,43524,TAPE RPTD  09/87
BDS-09/14/58,SSS-121-32-1234                                                  
01 ES-,DERFLINK INC,HOSEHEAD,CA                                                
02 EF-,SELF EMPLOYED,SCROTUM,SD                                                
03 E2-,ADMIN,BEVCO ELECTR.,NJ                                                  
So what the hell does this shit mean? Well, obviously, it begins with the
person's name. 'SINCE' refers to the first time Equifax generated a file on 
thisperson, while FAD is the last time the file was updated. Next is listed the
person's places of residence, both present and past. (RPTD is the last date 
thatthey were still listed as being at that address). The 'BDS-' line contains 
the  person's birthdate and social security number, and sometimes their age as 
well.   The following '01 ES' type lines concern the person's employers, again 
both   present and past, with addresses for them.
Next, you'll see the following:
 *SUM-08/85-07/90,PR/OI-NO,FB-NO, ACCTS:3,HC$0-25000, 2-ONES, 1-FOUR.
 *INQS-OCEAN NATL 444bb952   11/23/90
Okay, this is a little more complex. The SUM indicates the period during which
this person has had credit of any kind. I do not know what PR/OI and FB indica
te ACCTS: is the number of entries on the list about to follow, ie, the amount 
of credit extensions this person has ever had. HC$ is the span on the values 
of these credit extensions. That is, he has been extended as much as $25,000 
at onetime. The 'ONES, FOURS, FIVES, NINES, ZEROS' etc indicate the TYPE of 
credit    accounts the person has. I am still in the process of deciphering 
what each one means. INQS is self explanatory. Listed are all the firms which 
have recently   pulled this person's file, and the date they did so.
Next comes the good part:

*   FIRM/ID CODE       RPTD  OPND  H/C TRM  BAL P/D CS MR ECOA  ACCOUNT NUMBER
SEARS      *906DC29    08/90 07/85    0      523     R4 01 J  8764-5648374612846
CITIBK-MC  *906BB40    08/90 11/88 5000     1234     R1 34 S  542412345678
GMAC       *906FA34    07/90 10/87  25K 10Y  10K     I1 17 A  192-123456789
END OFREPORT     CBI AND AFFILIATES  -  11/26/90                              

Okay, broken down, this shit means:
FIRM/ID CODE: The creditor and its CBI account code. RPTD: Last time that entry
was updated, either due to purchase or change in credit extension. OPND: Date
the account was first opened. H/C: Ammount of credit. In the case of actual
credit cards, this is the card limit. TRM: Length of time the credit is extend-
ed for, in weeks. If followed by a 'M', it is in months, and if followed by a 
'Y' it is in years. BAL: Ammount still owed on the card as of the last update.
P/D, CS, MR, ECOA: beats the shit outta me!!! ACCOUNT NUMBER: Self-explanatory.
VISAS begin with a 4, MASTERCARDS begin with a 5, DISCOVER with a 6, etc. If 
you are uncertain as to whether an account is a card or not, run it thru your
friendly credit checker to check. Many entries will have helpful explanatory
footnotes like:  CLOSED ACCOUNT, CARD STOLENORLOST, REDEEMED REPOSESSION
REALESTATE MORTGAGE, AUTOLOAN, ACCOUNTCLOSEDBYCONSUMER

PART 7: Safe use/abuse of CBI
Okay, so you have an account and you know how to use it, right? So, what 
next?Well, firstly, you'd better cover your ass. As I said earlier, be sure to 
call  CBI through some sort of number-diverting system. To preserve the life of
your  account and protect your ass, you should also take the following precau-
tions.  First, try to call CBI dialups only during normal business hours 
LOCALTOTHE  DIALUP (based on whatever time zone it's in). That is, Monday-
Friday from 9:00amto 6:00pm if at all possible. Try NOT to call ATALL after 
12:00 midnight, as   this is extremely suspicious. Secondly, never pull files 
sequentially from your phone book (more on this later). Skip around as far as 
last names go. Thirdly,  don't be greedy...don't pull 100 files per 
call...stick to 10-20, no more that  30. Lastly, don't bother pulling the file 
of the President. We already tried pulling ole' George's file, but all we
got was his social security # and a message stating that that file was 'not
available'.

PART 8: Who do I pull?
It's essential that you never waste time on CBI, as accounts are valuable and 
not to be trifled away. So, don't spend all your time pulling your friends 
filesor your neighbor's. Go for the BIGBUCKS. Get out your local phone book and
run through it looking for names with 'attorney', 'MD', 'DDS' and such after 
them.  Then pull THOSE files. Also, its not a good idea to only pull files from
your local area...so...run down to your local library. All libraries have phone
directories for major cities nationwide. (Don't bother with the Manhattan guide,
as none of those addresses are residential ones, all offices and such).  Again,
try to pull the files of affluent folks. When you take an address from a phone
book, always try to make sure it isn't an office address.  Many directories will
list both office and 'res' ie residential numbers and addresses. You must have
the person's BILLING address to pull his/her file.  There are various other ways
to get peoples names and addresses, so be creative and have fun.

PART 9: Getting an account
This is the REAL hard part. Most people simply trade away their hard-earned
info for a CBI account. Frankly, the fact that few people know how to get new
ones is the reason why there are so few in circulation. SO, its time for all 
youhacks to start getting them YOURSELF. How, you may ask? There are two ways. 
The most commonly used way is to social-engineer them. Flip thru your local 
phone book and find a small car dealership. Call them up. Pretend you are a
CBI or Equifax employee. Again, be creative. If you sound like a 14yr old,
or if you can't lie to save your ass, don't try this. You'll only phuck things
up for the rest of us. Design your own scams. Be convincing. Leave them a number
to call   you back at...a loop, or a BBS #, or better yet, find a number thats
always busy. Or, if you have one, set up a VMB to issue a greeting as the office
of the person who you are impersonating. In short, be devious. After all, you're
a hacker!
Method two is a bit more tough. All CBI accounts that I've ever run into so far
take on a simple format, presented above. Now, you'll notice that the beginning
of an account (613bb2114) looks remarkably like the IDNUMBER presented in the
files you pull (ie 906dc29). The reason for this is that they are ONEINTHESAME.
Yes, thats right, CBI is nice enough to give you an extensive listing of partial
accounts for all of its subscribers. All accounts take on this format:
[3 DIGITS][2 LETTERS][2-5 DIGITS][a dash][2 CHARACTERS, EITHER NUMBER ORLETTER]
Quaint, yes? Now, since the company codes provide parts one thru three, all you
need to figure out is the 2-character code after the dash. In all cases I've
seen so far, this has been a letter followed by a number, but I am not certain
that this is ALWAYS the case.
So, in short: HACK AWAY.
