             How to get a free account on CompuServe

 **---------<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>---------**



CompuServe: Bastards who charge a RIDICULOUS amount of money for
            a limiting source of old PD files and trick you with
            hidden charges and taxes and don't even have Zmodem.



I dislike CompuServe, therefore, I will prove them to be idiots
with loose security. This file is a created simply as an insult
to CompuServe, I do not encourage anything written in this text
and it is all a joke file as far as I'm concerned.





Steps to Getting a free account on CS:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Get a rebate check. (buy some oil or batteries and wait for the
   $1 rebate check and save it)

2. Log onto CompuServe as new, follow the procedures with a fake name
   and when it asks for payment process, select CHECKFREE.

3. The take your rebate check and enter the numbers that CS ask for
   from the check, answer 'yes' to "Is your name on this check?"

4. Your all set, you have an account and it usually takes 3 business
   days for the account to be caught but you have 3 days online to
   go into the CB and sware all you want at the gay people on channel
   13 or whatever turns you on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE #1: Try to log on on a Friday and usually you'll have access
         until about Monday - Tuesday.

NOTE #2: Check out the stock market! go ahead, Open that bank account!
         Make that cruise reservation! (GO TRAVEL)

NOTE #3: WRITE DOWN THE FAKE NAME YOU USE BECAUSE YOU'LL NEED IT TO
         LOG ON TO THE DIFFERENT AREAS IN COMPUSERVE!!


----------------------------------------------------------------------

TIP ON NOT GETTING CAUGHT!
    \
     ------> Use a system like Telenet or Tymnet or whatever you
             can use to call CompuServe with: EX.


             YOU -------> Tymnet(whatever) -----> Compuserve
                                   \                  /
                                    ----trace line----


If CompuServe traces the line, it will go to the service you use
to call through and tracing back to you usually won't be done
because it is too costly. (The service will bill you through
CompuServe so no acct for the service is usually needed)



This is a fairly risk free method.
