destruction, and electronic banking. 
     And Famous Hackers' School offers something that no other 
school offers: backup career guidance.  This special course 
module will show you how to turn your eventual arrest into a 
media event, a bestselling book, and a secure position as a 
computer security consultant!

     * A collection of timed viruses for your personal use 
     * Official FHS membership card, recognized by bail-bondsmen 
       the world over

       obsolete operating system manuals

throw in our famous "Build-a-Virus" kit, complete with two-page, 
illegible photocopied instruction sheet, at no extra charge!
