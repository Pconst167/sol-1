Most auto teller machines require an
ID card to retrieve money.  The circuit
ry inside the machines has been made mo
re sophisticated year after year. After
 the 3 highschool kids got $92,000 from
 a machine in California in 1983, the F
BI investigated and found out how they
used  cracked account numbers to gain a
ccess, the California Trade Commision i
mposed stricter regulations regarding t
he protection of bank teller machines.
The all-plastic ID cards which could be
 easily forged with the right account n
umber and codes were replaced with undu
plicatable ones which had a special mat
erial only sensitive sensors in the mac
hines could detect.  When faulty cards
were inserted in the machines, alarms w
ent off and guards were summoned. Lots
of good hackers were taken out of busin
ess this way.  Now, not only is therea
 special coating on the IDcards, but t
he codes also indicate social security
# and name, age and address of the owne
r.  The computers were impenetrable, be
cause those carrying ID numbers and inf
o were unreachable by conventional phon
e lines.  Codes were shipped via  armor
ed car.
   The phone line #'s used by the ID re
cords computers are all on the military
 exchange, and an automatic tracer is a
lways included.  My friend tried hackin
g this one with a sandbox attached, and
 although he wasn't traced, the securit
y traced his hacked ID number. He told
me in a note he slipped me in the juvey
 he's been put in.  The security caught
 him when they checked his ID number ag
ainst the backup copy at the supposed b
ank.  If this isn't hard enough, the ba
nk's files are also checked against har
d copy backup files, unaccessable to yo
u know who (us!).
     If anyone has any info that can he
lp us with this dilemma, please call!
