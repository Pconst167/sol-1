MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION ON SELECTED COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


BATCH                                        Displays Batch information
~~~~~

    BATCH {-DISPLAY}
          {-STATUS}

-DISPLAY, -DP
    Provides information on jobs being processed by the Batch subsystem.
    Information includes the number of jobs waiting, deferred, and held
    in each queue, and the user id, job id, user number, and queue for
    each currently executing job.

-STATUS, -ST
    Provides a one-line summary of the status of all batch jobs.

Other options to the BATCH command can be used only by the System
Administrator or operator to control the processing of users' jobs.

To submit, manage, and monitor batch jobs, use the JOB command.

For more information, see the Operator's Guide to the Batch Subsystem
and the Operator's Guide to System Commands.


LON                                Controls Phantom Logout Notification
~~~

    LON  [-ON]
         [-OFF]

LON -ON, the default, switches on phantom logout notification so
that PRIMOS notifies the initiator of a phantom process when the
phantom is logged out.

LON -OFF defers logout notification messages.  PRIMOS then stores
these in a buffer until you issue a LON -ON command.  Accumulated
phantom logout messages are then displayed at your terminal.

For further information, see the PRIMOS Commands Reference Guide.



ADD_REMOTE_ID                        Sets up user id for remote systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abbreviation:  ARID

   ADD_REMOTE_ID user-id [password] -ON nodename [-PROJECT project-id]
                         [-PROMPT]

    user-id             =  id user wishes his phantoms to use on
                           the specified remote system

    password            =  password for that id

    -PROMPT             =  requests that ARID prompt the user for
               (           his or her password, rather than requiring
                           the password to be entered on the command
                           line.  When ARID prompts for the password,
                           the password is not echoed.

    -ON nodename        =  specifies name of system on which id is
                           is to be used

    -PROJECT project-id =  project with which user is to be
                           affiliated on the remote system

Within a Primenet network, some or all sites may have been configured
to require validation of users attempting remote file access. The
ADD_REMOTE_ID command allows a user to set up an identity to be
validated for such access.  This identity, "user-id", must already
exist at the remote site "nodename" before the ADD_REMOTE_ID command
is used.  Remote IDs may be established for up to 16 remote sites.
The ID established by this command persists until the user logs out,
until the user deletes it with the REMOVE_REMOTE_ID command,
or until the user gives a new ADD_REMOTE_ID command with the same
nodename.

For further information, see the PRIMOS Commands Reference Guide
or the PRIMENET Guide.

PRIMOS OPERATOR'S TRICKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When hackers establish themselves in a system, a warfare between them and the
operators breaks out.  They have a number of tricks they can use. On MINERVA
DIALCOM SYSTEM 08, accounts had a habbit of dying rather suddenly if the
command OFF was used to log of the system.  If however a person used the LOG
command which does the same function, they no longer died by themselves.
Could have been a coincidence, but it has happened so many times to me, that
there must be something in it.
When we use the NETLINK facility, the OPS discovered that there is a pattern
to the systems we use.  For example outdials and chat systems like ALTOS who
everyone called.  All they did was monitor the users with Watchdog and kill
the account that happened to connect to one of the suspect NUA's. The solution
to this problem is to send a few hundered messages to regular users to come
for a chat to one of the systems.   As soon as they start killing real users
accounts, they'll sure think twice.  An easier way is to simply put different
Pads between you and the host as a bridge. This can be another dialcom,
primenet etc.
By far the dirtiest and the most low down thing they do, is sit there and watch
you hack into the system, with great amusement. Then some time later as soon
as you get in, you get a FORCED OF FROM PRIMOS message and the account goes
dead.  Meanwhile you see your imediate future collapse before your blood shot
eyes.   Well, not to worry.  Either use a bit of social engineering since they
will expect the real user to call to get the account re-ativated, or make sure
that watching you hack is not enjoyable. By what I mean is set up a sprinting
program, which you can have running 24 hours a day.  Get it to try a password
and then just sit there for a minute, trying the next five and so on.  It makes
things lot harder for them to pick up your scent and if they do catch on, they
can't afford to wais the time so the kick you off and you haven't lost much.
If you have an autodial modem, and you wish to hack minerva for example, then
you have nothing to worry about.  Just hang up after lets say 10 attempts and
re-dial the number. You will placed onto a different MIDAS port and the ops
have virtually no chance in hell of telling you from the real users.


THE LATEST HACKER WEAPON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a beauty which I came across only weeks ago. What can be easier than
having the system change the password back to its original after the operator
or the user has change it?    This is another bit of info I can't describe in
this file, but I'll tell you the principle, so if you are familiar with primos
in a little way, you can set it all up.
All you have to do is get the system to change the password to the original,
once it was killed. The new password will be replaced by the old so that you
can get back on. Once back on, you will find a file with the very password the
operator used to kill the account.  Reset it to this password and all is well
once more and no one will be the wiser.  You can't leave new files in the UFD,
since that would be a giveaway. Any output data can be stored in another
directory or just attached to the ends of existing files.


OUTDIAL SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I haven't heard of a public outdial provided by austpac for austpac users, but
there is no reason why there shouldn't be one somewhere out there.
A lot of overseas networks provide this service.
An OUTDIAL is a modem connected to the PACKET SWITCHING NETWORK,
which allowes the network users to call computers outside the network, on the
PTSN.  It only seems free to use, but infact the NUI subsribers pay for its
use in the form of online charges for connect time.  That's more or less why a
lot of outdials tend to go dead if used by overseas users rather frequently.
For calling up Bulletin boards anywhere in the world, a decent outdial is a
must.   Here is one which I found two days ago, but which unfortunatelly
may have passed away by the time you get to this file.  This outdial has bee
around for a while now, but only recently they got around to updating the
software and hardware. In other words, it works now.

ok, try this:   NUA:  03106005566    to login, type OUTDIAL

A while back I wrote a rather large file on OUTDIAL systems, but as I was
looking through it recently, I was amazed how I managed to put so much
garbage into a file of such size.  I guess there are still some interesting
points there, but there are so many different outdials now, its not very
accurate.

CANADIAN OUTDIALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Canadians are a very starnge race of people.  That is reflected in the
type of outdials one finds on DATAPAC. There is between two to ten outdials
in each area, and each one serves a particular area and baud rate.  It's a
rather starange system, but it works if your computer is in Canada. Calling
international like to the USA, one encounters a few problems. It is believed
that the outdials service only the local area, but I have managed to connect
to a few US systems. The next assortment of NUA's you are about to see is a
never before published list of Canadian outdials. Most of them are not
present in any publication which lists outdials, so there might be some
capable of international connections.  I have never tried a majority of them,
so I can't tell you which do what and to who.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you encounter a system, you need to know what you are up against, if you
are going to hack in.   This will help you identify the manufacturer and type
of system:

HP-3000    -  Quite easy to identify, by the typical ":" prompt.  also gives
              errors such as  (cierr 1402) and often says:
              Expected Hello, Job, Project ID - (cierr 1402) or something
              simmilar

VAX        -  Quite straight forward. The typical vax responces are:

              Username:
              Password:
              User Authorization Failure!

              You get 3 attempts at a password/username pair.

UNIX       -  This one can be tricky but most systems come up with:

              login:         or     systemname login:
              password:             password:

              You can get anything from 1 to infity attempts before the system
              disconnects.

TOPS - 20     They usually say TOPS - 20 Monitor when encountered.  They have
              a typical '@' prompt and have various help commands before login.

HONEYWELL     Most of them would have this responce:

              $$ Device Type Identifier:

IBM VM/370    These will give you a responce such as:

              Username not in cpl directory!  when you try to login under a
              non existent username. the often have a prompt such as '.' or '!'

PRIMOS        Most system running Primos, ie PRIMENETS, with the exception of
              Dialcoms will give you this prompt.  'OK,'  or 'ER!'

DIALCOMS      They have a habbit of stating which System the are, ie
              BT-GOLD Gold System 81. They give the '>' prompt and a typical
              responce would be.

              Please login
              >
              Illegal Login!
              Please Login
              >

DG AOS/VS     These systems can be mistaken with VAX's since they do have a
              prompt simmilar to a vax, however the often say something like

              R05F07D55A Enter new line to login:

              Then it comes up with statistics and either VCONx or CONx on the
              right line of the line.

CYBER         Usually comes up with the NOS SOFTWARE SYSTEM>


These are the major ones I guess.  I'll have a complete rundown on all the
systems in use in the future, with a lot more detail on each.

If you ever need any sort of information on any particular system, NUA etc in
any country, the best way is to go directly to the source.  The following is a
list of addresses where you may inquire and will most probably get the help
you need.
