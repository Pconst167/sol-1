So...  My file on Sprintnet...  how do I start?
ok.
Sprintnet is a nifty little huge network of computers around the world, all
connected to dial-ins correspondingly placed.  The computers connected to this
net are all types of systems... YooNiKz, Primos (yeah!), VMS/VAX, etc.  These
all belong to major companies, or, at least, most of them.  These juicy beasts
are just sitting here waiting to be hacked up by young, angry, pimply-faced,
masturbating adolescents.  These systems are very easy to access, and, with a
little persistence, can be hacked right in half.  So, you say...  What about
getting traced by these people?  Well, here is where I start a new line...

-Sprint/Telenet's-crappy-tracing-systemz-

The people who designed SprintNet aren't very smart...  You see, they have very
odd ways of networking their computers, and security is second-hand.  The only
phone connexion that the higher-level systems (dial-outs) have are to the 
dial-in (your local dial-in, that is).  And the trace stops there.  It's 
amazing how simple some people can be.  The system is just too powerful.  Too 
big.  Traces can't get through.  This provides anyone with hours of risk-free 
phun.

-How-to-access-Sprint/Telenet-

It's easy...  Just dial 1-800-546-1000 (2500 for 9600 baud up), press "@", <CR> twice, and your get a 
"TERMINAL=" prompt.  Type "D1", and press <CR>.  Then you will get a "@".  
Type "MAIL", and press <CR>.  It will then ask you for a Username and 
Password.  Type "PHONES"<CR> for both.  From there, follow the prompts to 
find your local (or closest to local) dial-in.  Press Alt-H, or, if you feel 
lucky, try to access a few connex from the in-WATS.  Right.  Blah.
That's all right there..  One more thing, at the "@" prompt in your local 
dial-in, type in an area code followed by a 3-6 number address, and, if you 
are lucky, you will have found a dial-out.  A list of these addresses will be 
printed later.

My phingers are getting tired, so, See-Ya!
