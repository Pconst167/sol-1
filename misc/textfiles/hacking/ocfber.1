                     Bylaws of the OCF.







1.   The  General  Manager  and  the  Site  Managers  cannot
     appoint directors except when the OCF is not in session
     and the Board of Directors cannot make a quorum because
     there are fewer than five directors in town.

2.   The OCF Board of Directors shall meet weekly.

3.   Any  Director   missing   two   consecutive   regularly
     scheduled  meetings  will  be  removed  from the Board,
     regardless of whether the meetings achieve quorum.

4.   OCF Board meetings must be announced to  all  Directors
     at least twenty-four hours in advance.

5.   Resolutions by the Board of Directors can be put  to  a
     vote  electronically.  When putting a resolution to the
     Board  in  this  manner,  all  Board  members  must  be
     included  in  the  request for votes.  To pass an issue
     this way, at least half of all the Board  members  must
     agree.   If  the  motion  fails  to  achieve a majority
     within seventy-two hours of  being  called  to  such  a
     vote,  the  motion fails.  The results of the vote will
     be posted in role call form.

6.   Attendance lists and minutes for all OCF meetings shall
     be  maintained  for the decisions of that meeting to be
     valid.
