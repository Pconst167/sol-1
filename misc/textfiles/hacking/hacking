         It may be a great mystery to most, but, what really
 os Hacking?? Is is like caughing violently, or like whittling
 a small piece of wood. Lets find out.............



 Lately there has been considerable attention paid in the mass media to
computer hacking.  Unfortunately, the media considers hacking to be
equivalent to vandalizing computer systems.  This form of electronic
terrorism has nothing whatsoever to do with real computer hacking.
 A computer hacker is someone who:
. programs quickly and programs well
. enjoys what s/he is doing
. is knowledgable in the field
 Such a person has little or nothing to do with computer vandals, who
tend to show off simple stunts to overly-impress the ignorant general
public.  If you think that breaking into various computer systems shows
how smart you are, think again.  I can assure you that there is absolutely
nothing that these various punks have thought of that hasn't already been
thought of years before.  A real computer hacker doesn't need to break
into a computer system, just as a real locksmith doesn't need to carry
keys.
 There are much more profitable endeavors to get into than breaking into
computer systems...and they have the advantage of being legal.  I seriously
suggest that you think again before engaging in illegal activities which
only make a nuisance out of yourself.
 If you want to find out more about REAL computer hacking -- an old and
honorable profession -- read "The Hacker's Dictionary: A Guide to the World
of Computer Wizards", published by Harper and Row.  Believe me, it is much
more satisfying being a computer wizard than a computer vandal.
