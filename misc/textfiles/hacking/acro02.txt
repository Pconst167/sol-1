
        It's amazing that my first Acronym's text file went over so well!
So, here's the second and much larger companion to it...Acro 2.  Yeah, I
know 2 days is a long, long wait for a file.  <G>  If I keep this up, I will
probably have more numbers than I know what to do with.  Anyways, my list
of numbers keeps growing and circulation for these text files is ever-
increasing!  Of course, I could always use more numbers and more people
to help me spread this rather small series.  Hey, what's 2 or 4k for some of
you runners?  Anways, I don't mind the file going around, as I don't feel
there's anything illegal about telling What certain letters stand for what!
If I'm wrong, someone tell me...By the Way, if I leave your group out or just
haven't put it in yet.  Send me e-mail as to EXACTLY how you would like it
to appear.  I don't do ads..so, no full screen ANSI/ASCII folks.  But I would
like contributions to the series.  Such as my group is "Lame0 Cracker's of
America" and we go by LCA!  That's about all I need.  Don't really need a
history or anything..just what ya stand for.  So, here's your chance to get
your group famous!  You know me..you know where to find me!

        Welp, so much for another issue of Acronyms!  I'm sure I will have
a ton more for you next time.  The file looks like it's gonna get bigger
each and every time I put one out.  After I have done every acronym I can
think of I MAY put out a complete guide to acronyms with the entire list in
one file.  This is a slight chance right now, as I have too much backed up
on other fronts.

        Well, as usual, I have my Howdy's!  Hey goes out to all the royal
513/606 home front!  Especially to Insanus Maximus, Lestat, and Akira to
name a few.  On the Long distance side, hey to my friends in 415, 416, 818,
904, and especially those in 619!  {Yeah, I get around!} On the Looong, long
far off front, I want to say hi to all the cool folks I found in 011+81+1,
and those in 001+46+8.  You'll be hearing from me soon!

        Now for a new section!  The Booos!  Boos go out to Pirate Inc for
Copying the name of Pirate Mag and Phrack INC at the same time.  9600 lamer
boards that lock out 2400 callers just cuz they are slower!  {I don't care
HOW much you paid for your stupid modem!  I've seen 2400 baud callers post
more and that have more files than you can wet-dream about!}  People that
crash the Net!  And last but not least..those rotten Narc's {not the group!}
