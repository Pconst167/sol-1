                        Thanx: The Hacker & Bonker Pee

_______________________________________________________________________________

     This file is on the general basics of hacking into TRW to find a credit check on some guy you know.  Useful for checking on teachers, people who log on your board, or any other use.  TRW is not the greatest place to try and hack at.  The people on the system watch very carefully for 'hackers'.  Use your common sense.  

________________________________________________________________________________
     TRW is a database in which companies and banks can run credit checks on customers or in other words people coming for a loan of some type.  If you go in for a loan at a rather computerized bank the lady taking your loan request will have a terminal in front of her.  In a few seconds she will have your whole life's credit history on her monitor showing all of your late pac-bell bills, other banks account numbers, and the best thing of all; your credit cards.  It will show everything from Diners Club to Mastercard.  This is the greatest for sending stuff to peoples homes like say a hundred toilets or something, I will discuss that later.
     TRW is a dangerous source in the recent days.  As I remember several people from Homestead (a high school near me) got there asses hung out to dry for trashing at some loan center then calling up TRW and fucking around with it.  TRW is an instant trace now, so be extra careful when hacking it.  If at all possible take your setup out to a fortress (pay telephone for all you Gimps).  TRW is a powerful source, for the sake of others do not abuse it, just like everything else.
     In the recent days TRW now expanded to everyone in the whole United States of America who is a citizen is now in the TRW database.  To log on to TRW Credit Union dial your local access port. I will list them at the end of the file.  After you log on press a few <return>s.  Then it will say "TRW ^G".  You either type I or ctrl-G.  Then TRW will say "Circuit Building in Progress", and wait for a few seconds then clear the screen.  Now you have to type what geographical location you are in.  So what you do is type T then the states intials you are looking for and a 1 or a 2.  So if you are looking for someone in San Jose, CA it would look like this Tca2.  These also work:
 
_______________________________________________________________________________

Tca1
Tca2
Tca3
Tca4
Tca5
Tnv1
Taz1
Tnj1
Tnj2
Ttx1
Ttx2
Tfl1
Tfl2


_______________________________________________________________________________

     After you do the geographical location you will type in the subscriber information number and a password along with basic information on the person you are trying to get credit info on.  It would look like:

Subscriber Number   Password  Last Name of Person Firstname of Person ..., House Number   First Letter of Street Name   ZIP CODE

     Below is an exact copy of a conversation with TRW:

________________________________________________________________________________
 
TRW ^G

I

Circuit building in progress

Tca2

9999999-cd7 Moore Ian ...,12009 C 95070
^s ^q ^q

_______________________________________________________________________________

     It will then wait for a few seconds and then print out a complete file on him.  Now to obtain passwords is fairly easy.  You need to locate a Sears Store, Citicorp Loan or a Bank.  Sometimes loan or mortgage places have them also.  You look for a print out of a person and at the very top of the page there is a seven digit subsriber code.  You need to get that code then hack out the five, four, or three digit password.  Then you are in business.

    After years of reading 800 Extender lists I have been fully dissatisfied with the lack of quality, amount and accessibilities of the list.  That is why I have decided to write my own list of available 800 Extenders.  
    The phone number is exactly that, the phone number to dial.  Since all of these are 800s there is no charge.  The code is the format.  If it is in paranthesees that is how many digits the code is, everthing else is what you dial.  The # means the phone number in which you wish to call.

                                  File #2

                            By: Type A' Maniac

                Thanx: Bonker Pee, The Hacker & White Dragon

_______________________________________________________________________________

     In the past years the 950 exchanges became very popular within many big cities and suburban areas of the nation.  This was about the time that all of the "other" long distance carriers came into the world of communications.  AT&T no longer took the spotlight.  Now there was ITT, MCI, US Telecom (Sprint), Allnet, Lifeline, Skyline, and many others.  950s were a step towards the future bringing all the long distance companies into one dialup that could be accessed by all phones within the area.  This was good and bad for phreaks. 
     For one thing it brought all these companies into an available area that was mostly the same dialup for the entire nation.  So if you were talking to someone in New Jersey and you lived in California it meant that you might have to find the dialup for let's say Sprint in New Jersey or whatever.  With 950's the Sprint dialup in most areas of the nation, a few exceptions, is 950-1033. This meant a new era for phreaks with the easibility to give codes to people across the nation with very easy dialups.  
     There was one draw back, these 950s were found to be relatively unsafe as found by such people as The Fugitive (619) got fined several thousands of dollars when caught using the allnet 950.  Other people such as The Guy (213), Smart Ass (415), and many others have been caught using 950s for numbers of reasons.  950s are relatively safe though, especially when compared to Company owned 800s.
     Unlike the AT&T 102880 long distance operators (which are not voice) the 950s are not insta-trace.  AT&T is almost completely phreak free in the recent days.  To use AT&T codes you must use fortress.  As soon as you connect with the operator at AT&T the little tramp has your phone number plus id code on her computer screen.  The computer then saves your phone number until the AT&T calling card bill has been paid with no complaints.  So it would be very unwise to even attempt to use AT&T codes from your home.  Which now leaves you with the other guys, the 950s.
     I will tell you about some of the various 950 dialups within the 408 area. Some of these may vary within your area so do not rely on this as a dialup sheet.  Look for 408 Alliance 950 dialups.  It will list them all for all of the area codes.
     Allnet has two dialups:  950-1044 or 950-1444.  950-1044 is a six digit code with a code about ever thousand tries.  950-1044s codes last only two weeks so by the time you scan them out and start using them they rarely lastd more than a half day or two days.  950-1444s codes last only one week so by the time you scan them out and start using them they do not last more than a half day or two days.  Allnet is a company designed on people who travel alot on business all over the nation and to get in touch with other employees carry the cards.  The codes are usual a business code and not a personal account. 
     MCI codes are the hardest to phreak.  They are set up so you dial 950-1022 then dial 0 + Number you want to dial+card number.  The card number is usually your phone number + four digit code.  So if you had a code it would look like 408-371-0000-9933.  MCI requires a special scanner preferably The Code Infiltrator.  MCI is a personal company more than a business company.  Some people use them as a relatively business card but are mainly used for personal uses.
     Sprint is set up as either a sprint FON card or as a regular code.  They are set up so you dial 950-1033 then dial 0 + Number you want to dial + card number.  The card number is usually your phone number + four digit code.  So if you had a code it would look like 408-371-0000-9933.  Sprint requires a special scanner preferably The Code Infiltrator.  950-1033 then dial code + number you want to dial. The code is a 8 digit code.  Sprint is a personal company more than a business company.  Some people use them as a relatively business card but are mainly used for personal uses.
     Skyline is a company like jointly owned by IBM/ITT.  It is a 6 digit code. 950-1088 then dial code + number you want to dial.  Skyline is precautious of users so generally people stay away from it.  IBM is full of jews who like to protect there money and do not put up with scanners.  Be careful.  Skyline is a option available only if you are a employee of ITT or IBM.  
     Lexitel is set up as a 7 digit code.  950-1066 then dial code + number you want to dial.  Lexitel is a company that operates buy selling cheap codes to people to save money on long distance charges.  Lexitel does not work in the 408 area.
     Here is a list of the 950s for the 408 area code.  This may or may not work in your area:

                  950-1022 MCI (14)
                  950-1033 Sprint (8) (14)
                  950-1044 Allnet (6)
                  950-1087 Unknown (6)
                  950-1088 Skyline (6)
                  950-1099 Unknown (6)   
                  950-1444 Allnet (8)
                  950-1999 Unknown (6)

________________________________________________________________________________
     To start off I would like to say that do NOT try to card something if you don not sound  very mature.  The people at the ordering place are not very smart but are not completely stupid, especially to be faked out by an eleven year old kid.  Carding is not for everyone, only for those that get a thrill about ripping off American Express, Mastercard or Visa.
     In this file I will discuss how to get carbons or card numbers, how to get the address of the lucky cardholders, how to order and then finally the end result; how to pick up the goodies.
     Carbons are very easy to get. For one thing never search for carbons in the middle of a busy alley or back street since "trashing" is very illegal.  If you do get caught "trashing" ditch the carbons immediately.  Carbons are a black sheet with imprinted numbers on them.  Make sure that it has the cardholder's phone number on it.  If it is a mastercard try to get one with a driver's license number on it.  I will discuss later how to tell the difference between the three major types of cards.
     Now you should have at least 10 carbons, otherwise it is a waste to go any farther.  Now you need to dial up the telephone number on the carbon and ask for the cardholder.  Then say you are from United Cashiers of America and ask if he/she would like a free $50 value coupon book.  Take down the lucky guys/gals address and there you have it.  If it is a Mastercard and you don't have the drivers license call back in a few days and say, you are from Department of Motor Vehicles.  Say that some of the drivers licenses have been misprinted and ask for there drivers license number.  Most of the idiots will do it.  Now do this for every carbon you have.
     What you need is a few places to order the goodies from.  I will list some computer stores at the end of this file.  Look through magazines like A+, Incider, Apple Review, Family Computing, MAC World, PC World, etc.  If you are looking for stereos or electronics look in Stereo Review, Best catalog, DJM Electronics, Markline, etc.  Okay now write out all the information on a blank piece of paper.  It should be a complet speech of what you are going to say to the little bitch on the telephone.  It should look somewhat like this:

________________________________________________________________________________

California Computer Discount
408-555-1212
Talk "Hello, I read an article in Incider and saw your add for the phasor card.  How much is it?"
     "Oh, that's a pretty good price, ummmm I think I will order it."

                       Card Information
        John I. Doe
        5424 1800 1234 5678
        Mastercard
        Bank Id: 1234
        Address: 199999 Winter Lane, San Jose, NY  95000
        Home Phone: 408-555-1212
        Work Phone: 408-555-1212
        Driver's License: 1234C1234-1234

And if you are going to sendd to another address (not recommended) write that down also.  Rememeber to give the person a telephone number that just is always busy or rings on forever.

________________________________________________________________________________
     When using American Express never ship to another address, but you do not need a bank id, and you can give fake telephone numbers for both work and home.  If you are using Mastercard you can ship to another address but you need a bank id, and you need a driver's license but can give fake telephone numbers for both work and home.  If you are using Visa you can ship to another address but you need real telephone numbers for the home phone.
     Remember some of this information may vary.  Now if you shipped to another address be careful, steak outs are common with computer equipment.  Watch for any movement in the bushes or cards with US Government plates.  If there are either just walk on by, DO NOT RUN. If you did it to the cardholder's address call right before you go to pick it up.  If nobody answers jam on over, if someone does answer, your order is history.
     Identifying a Mastercard, Visa, & American Express is easy:

     This is a file about the basics you NEED to know before you go looking in those local drug stores for carbons, the local bell offices, the credit unions, the banks, realtors offices, schools, long distance companies, computer companies, and any other dumb shits that actually throw away good stuff.
     
_______________________________________________________________________________

     After you have found a decent can, make sure that you are not around ANYONE that might get a positive ID on you.  As many of you probably know, I use to go down to the local Hallmark shop and pick the lock off (discussed in file #7) then steal all of the carbons.  One day, I did that and a half hour later there were four cop cars and a Federal scum-mobile.  Can't guess what they were lookin' at.
     If the can you are wanting to get into has a lock on it, like ALL the ones around me do, you'll either have to pick the lock off or get some lock cutters (Refer to file #7 "Lock Picking").  Once you have managed to get into the can, remember what you are looking for.  If you are looking for carbons, make sure that they have phone numbers on them.  If you are at a credit union then you are very lucky.
     Credit Unions are a hacker's/carders DREAM!  If you actually have got into a credit union can without the video camera on you then you will have to look very hard for the one thing you are after:  the credit union password.  Each credit union has a bunch of nice goodies in cans but one main thing is there TRW Password and Account Numbers (Reder to file #5 "TRW Hacking").  Sometimes the idiots at the credit unions print out the whole entire list of credit cards they issue and expir. dates, along with phone numbers, addresses and zips. If you are ever lucky enough to get a hold of that two-hundred page list, you are probably going to have a lot of fun.
     Phone companies are A LOT of fun.  I remember the days of going across the street when I lived in Utah and going into Mountain Bell (now USWest) and grabbing booklets from the trash.  I personally never found anything worth a shit but I know a few in other states that have.  One person in New Jersey found a book telling how to use loops, what they are and all of them in the continental United States.  At AT&T we found over seventy printed out Calling Card Numbers.  Bunch of fucking idiots.  
     Banks are fun too.  At banks you can grab all sorts of things.  There are the TRW Accounts (as talked about in file #5 "TRW Hacking"), and the infamous bank account receipts.  Collecting these are fun, and then using them is even funner.  After you get some, make sure they have the Bank Holders Account Number and Name on the receipt.  If it does, go in the next day and get a withdrawl slip, fill the shit out and fill out the signature.  The people won't ask for I.D. if you are a minor.  Only withdraw about a hundred dollars, anymore and they will not do it.
     Schools sometimes have the grades, tardies and booklets thrown away.  This way you can find out the schools dialup for there shitty computerized grades and usually the password to it.  Allmost all high schools have a modem and computer, even my school which is one of the smallest in the state has a mini-computer.  

________________________________________________________________________________

     The easiest way to get good stuff is to get a hold of a car, either by borowing it from a friend or borowing it from an enemy (if you get what I mean).  Go to the can and grab three garbage bags.  Take it to the local school parking lot and start looking through it.  After you have grabbed all of the carbons out of it, take the bag and beam it on the top of the roof of the school.
     Remember that trashing is a Federal Offense.  If you get caught in a can you better come up with a fucking good excuse.  Try one like I am a poor kid looking for some food.  Think of some bullshit.  But if they catch you with carbons your ass is up the river.
