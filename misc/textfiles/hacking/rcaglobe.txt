                     THE RCA NETWORK:PART I
                               BY THE TELEX TROOPERS
 
     THE RCA NETWORK IS A SERVICE PROVIDED TO MANY COMPANIES FOR
THEIR@TELEX, AND TELEGRAM NEEDS.  THEY CAN COMUNICATE OVERSEAS,
SHORE-TO-SHIP, SHIP-TO-SHIP, AND DOMESTICALLY. ALSO OFFERED IN
THIS NETWORK IS A SERVICE KNOWN AS FYI.  FOR YOUR INFORMATION IS
A NEWS NETWORK ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LOOK UP CURRENT STOCK QUOTES,
WEATHER REPORTS, BEST-SELLER LIST, HOROSCOPES, AND MANY OTHER
HUMAN INTEREST THINGS, SUCH AS SENDING A MAILGRAM OF A GET-WELL
CARD, OR A BIRTHDAY CARD.
 
      THE SECURITY OF THIS SYSTEM IS RATHER LOW.  IT USES THE
ANSWERBACK OF THE COMPANY FOR IDENTIFICATION AND VALIDATION.
THEY DO THIS BY RANDOMLY SENDING A ^E, OR INQUIRE CHARACTER TO
THE ACCESSING TERMINAL.  IF THE TERMINAL DOES NOT ANSWER, IT WILL
DISCONNECT, OR IF THE PASSWORD IS NOT CORRECT, IT WILL HANG UP AS
WELL.
 
      ALL THAT NEEDS BE DONE IS TO HAVE A TERMINAL PROGRAM THAT
CONTINUALLY CHECKS FOR ^E'S AND SENDS A PRE-PROGRAMMED MESSAGE TO
THE HOST.  WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, YOU CAN ACCESS ONE OF THE LARGEST
DATABASES/SERVICES IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES, AND EVEN THE
WORLD.
 
     THE ANSWERBACK OF ANY COMPANY USING RCA NETWORK IS USUALLY
IN THE FORMAT SHOWN BELOW:
 
                      ####### ABCDEFGHIJ UR
 
                                           ######=TELEX#
                                       ABCDEFGHIJ=COMPANY ABBREV.
                                               UR=STANDARD SUFFIX
 
     TO UTILIZE RCA, SET YOUR TERMINAL AS ABOVE WITH THE ANSWER-
BACK OF A COMPANY THAT UTILIZES THE RCA NETWORK.  THEN CALL THE
RCA COMPUTER, AND YOU WILL RECEIVE A MESSAGE:
 
                             RCA GA
       AT THIS POINT YOU TYPE IN YOUR CHOICE, FOLLOWED BY A +.  FOR
THE HOTLINE (FYI) YOU WOULD TYPE 12+ WITH NO CARRIAGE RETURN.
THEN THE HOST WOULD SEND A ^E AND CHECK THE IDENTIFICATION OF
YOUR TERMINAL. IF IT WAS CORRECT, IT WILL CONTINUE INTO THE
SERVICE, PROMPTING YOU ALONG THE WAY.  TO SEND A STANDARD TELEX,
YOU WOULD MERELY TYPE IN THE TELEX NUMBER YOU WERE SENDING TO
FOLLOWED BY A +. WHEN DONE TYPING THE TELEX MESSAGE, YOU MERELY
TYPE 4 PERIODS IN A ROW, AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN CHARGABLE TIME.
AND BE DISCONNECTED FROM THE RCA SERVICE.
 
     THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH RCA IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A
300 BAUD CONNECTION TO THE PHONE NETWORK, THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE MODEM AND THE CENTRAL COMPUTER IS 50 BAUD.
 
     WHEN SENDING A TELEX TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY, YOU MUST USE A
COUNTRY CODE, AND THESE ARE AVAILABLE FROM YOUR NEAREST TELEX
DIRECTORY.
 
     TO SEND A TELEGRAM WITH THE RCA SERVICE, MERELY ENTER 11+ AT
THE RCA GA PROMPT.  FROM HERE YOU MAY SEND A TELEGRAM ANYWHERE ON
LAND, FOR A MARINE TELEGRAM, ENTER 13+. ALL PROCEDURES FOR MARINE
TELEGRAMS AND STANDARD TELEX MESSAGES WILL BE COVERED IN A FUTURE
FILE, BUT FOR NOW, THE HOTLINE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE TO USE WHILE
YOU ARE WAITING, SO VISIT YOUR LOCAL HACK, AND HE WILL INSTRUCT
YOU HOW TO USE THE FOLLOWING PHONE NUMBER:
 
                         1-800-526-3714
                               OR
                         1-800-526-3881
 
     FIRST NUMBER IS FOR DIRECT CONNECT, AND THE SECOND IS FOR
STORE AND FORWARD MESSAGES.
