IN THIS VOLUME, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE
OPERATORS OF MA BELL AND LOOK INTO AREA
CODES. ONE MORE THING, I WOULD LIKE TO
GIVE SPECIAL THANXS TO THE FOLLOWING
PEOPLE FOR THERE SUPPORT:

JUDGE DREDD
THE WOLF
MYSTIC WARRIOR

---------------------------------------

NOW ON WITH IT. THERE ARE BASICALLY 7
TYPES OF OPERATORS. SOME CAN BE VERY
USEFUL FOR INFORMATION, LIKE LITTLE
HINTS FOR SPRINT AND MCI CODES! ANY
WAYS, I WILL EXPLAIN IN DETAIL THE7
OPERATORS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.

TRAFFIC SERVICE POSISTION OPERATORS
=---------------------------------=

THIS OPERATOR IS THE OPERATOR YOU
USUALLY HEAR WHEN YOU CALL FROM A PAY
PHONE. SHE IS IN CHARGE OF GETTING ALL
BILLING INFO FOR CALLING CARDS AND
THIRD NUMBER CALLS. MAKING SURE YOU GET
THE RIGHT PERSON ON 1 TO 1 CALLS.
MAKING SURE THE PERSON ON THE OTHER
WILL PAY FOR THE COLLECT CALL. AND
LAST BUT NOT LEAST VERIFYING CALLING
CARDS, AND MAKING SURE YOU AREN'T
USING A CALLING CARD YOU AREN'T SUPP-
OSED TO BE USING. DON'T FUCK WITH THESE
OPERATORS, FOR THEY ARE DANGEROUS. THEY
ARE KNOWN TO HAVE THE CAPABILITIES OF
KNOWING IF YOU ARE CALLING FROM A
FORTRESS PHONE.

INWARD OPERATORS
=--------------=

THIS OPERATOR IS BASICALLY THE "0"
OPERATOR. SHE ISN'T MUCH OF USE. SHE
CAN JUST TELL YOU THINGS LIKE L.D.
INFORMATION. SHE CAN BE QUITE HELPFUL
FOR SPRINT NUMBERS. I KNOW ONE GUY WHO
SAID HE WANTED TO KNOW THE LOCAL SPRINT
NUMBERS TO CALL HIS GRANDMA, AND SHE
WAS RETARDED ENOUGH TO BELIEVE HIM.
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THESE RETARDS
THOUGH, IT IS PERFECTLY LEGAL FOR THEM
TO LISTEN IN ON YOUR PHONE CALLS IF
THEY THINK AN ILLEGAL ACT IS GOING ON.
ALSO, THEY HAVE THE POWER TO MONITOR
YOUR PHONE AT ALL TIMES (MODEM OR NO
MODEM!).

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE OPERATORS
=----------------------------=

THIS OPERATOR IS NOT MUCH OF A HELP IN
THE WAY OF HACKING, BUT SHE CAN BE
HELPFUL FOR PREFIXES. I ASKED HERE ONCE
FOR THE OTHER SURROUNDING PREFIXES OF
SEATTLE, AND SHE GAME THEM TO ME. IT
CAME IN VERY HELPFUL FOR GETTING MCI
NUMBERS. BASICALLY, YOU PHONE THIS
OPERATOR AND YOU GET PHONE NUMBERS OF
HER. NO BIG DEAL!

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEAF
=-------------------------------=

THESE OPERATORS ARE VERY, VERY HELPFUL,
FOR HACKING THAT IS. MOST DEAF PEOPLE
HAVE TELETYPEWRITER TERMINALS. SHE
TALKS TO THEM LIKE I WOULD TALK TO YOU
VIA A MODEM. IN FACT, THAT IS BASICALLY
WHAT A TELETYPEWRITER IS, A MODEM. HERE
IS A HELPFUL HINT FOR USING THIS
OPERATOR. PLAY DUMB, AND YOU WILL GET
ANYTHING OUT OF HER. ONE MORE THING,
ALOT OF MODEMS CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH
TELETYPEWRITER BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T
SUPPORT BAUDOUT. THE MODEMS I KNOW THAT
SUPPORT BAUDOUT, ARE AWESOME APPLE CATS
AND COOL PROMODEMS!

CN/A OPERATORS
=------------=

THESE OPERATORS ARE PROBABLY THE BEST
OPERATORS FOR HACKING! THEY CAN GIVE
YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT. THE TROUBLE IS,
 HOW DO YOU GET IT. ANYWAYS, THESE
OPERATORS WILL GIVE YOU UNLISTED
NUMBERS IF YOU HAVE A CALLING CARD.
THEY ARE VERY SECRETIVE, AND DON'T
LET PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.
BUT IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE BEUTIES
AS FRIENDS, YOU'VE GOT IT MADE!

INTERCEPT OPERATORS
=-----------------=

 THESE OPERATORS ARE IN CHARGE OF
SECURITY. IF YOU ARE REPORTED TO THE
COPS, FOR USING DIALERS OR HACKERS,
CHANCES ARE, IT WAS THESE BITCHES WHO
NARKED ON YOU. THEY FLIRT THEIR TRASERS
AND ARE QUICK WITH ONE. GET CAUGHT BY
ONE OF THESE OPERATORS AND YOU'LL
BE WAISTED!

OUTER OPERATORS
=-------------=

THESE OPERATORS ARE IN CHARGE OF
CONNECTION YOU TO ELECTRONIC SWITCH-
BOARDS. THEY CAN BE VERY USEFUL
OPERATORS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
DOING. MORE ON THESE OPERATORS IN
RAMBUG'S HACKING VOLUME #2.



WELL, THAT BASICALLY COVERS THE
OPERATORS. AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE
BITCHES CAN BE USEFUL.

NOW TO SHOW YOU HOW AREA CODES WORK.
THE FIRST NUMBER OF THE AREA CODE IS
A NUMBER FROM 2 - 9. THE SECOND NUMBER
IS 0 - 9. THE THIRD NUMBER IS FROM
0 - 1. USUALLY AN AREA CODE CAN'T ROSS
OVER A PROVINCES/STATES LINE. THI
MEANS, YOU CAN'T HAVE THE SAME AREA
CODE FOR VICTORIA AND TORONTO. BUT,
I REPEAT BUT, HERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS:

510 - TWX (USA)
610 - TWX (CANANDA)
700 - RESERVED FOR LATER USAGE
710 - TWX (USA)
800 - WATTS LINES
810 - DIAL-IT SERVICES
910 - TWX (USA & CANADA)

EXPLANATIONS ON THESE SERVICES ON
WILL BE MORE EXPLAINED IN RAMBUG'S
HACKING VOLUME #2. WELL, THIS WRAPPES
UP THIS VOLUME. I HOPE THIS FILE HELPS
YOU MORE ON THE WORLD OF HACKING.
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE, YOU CAN
REACH ME ON ANY OF THE BOARDS I
MENTIONED IN THE TITLE. WELL, BY FOR
NOW, AND REMEMBER, KEEP HACKING!

---===---===---===---===---===---===---

IN THIS VOLUME, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE
OUTER OPERATORS, THE MOST IMPORTANT
OPERATORS, AND MOST INFORMITIVE BY
FAR. ALSO, LIKE I PROMISED IN THE LAST
VOLUME, WE WOULD TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE
AREA CODE EXCEPTIONS. JUST BEFORE I GO
ON, I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY THANXS
ONCE AGAIN TO THE FOLLOWING FOR THERE
SUPPORT:

JUDGE DREDD
THE WOLF
MYSTIC WARRIOR

---------------------------------------

NOW LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE ISSUE.
AS I WAS SAYING IN VOLUME #1, OUTER
OPERATORS ARE IN CHARGE OF CONNECTING
YOU TO ELECTRONIC SWITCHBOARDS. YOU
KNOW, LIKE SAY YOU WANT TO CALL THROUGH
*SPRINT* OR *MCI*, YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN
YOUR 6-8 DIGIT CODE, AND IF YOU JUST
CALLED ANY OLD NUMBER AND PUNCHED IN
YOUR A CODE, THEY OPERATOR WOULD THINK
YOU BELONGED TO A MENTAL INSTITUTE!
NOW, WHEN YOU CALL A SPRINT NUMBER OR
MCI NUMBER, YOU ARE GOING THROUGH AN
OUTER OPERATOR, EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY NOT
KNOW IT. WHEN YOU DIAL THE SPRINT/MCI
NUMBER, YOU ARE REALLY CALLING THE
OUTER OPERATOR, WHO IN TURN CONNECTS
YOU TO THE SWITCHBOARD. YOU SAY, HOLY
SHIT, SHE CAN SEE WHAT I AM DOING, AND
WILL KNOW I AM PHREAKING VIA THE
SPRINT/MCI SWITCHBOARDS THAT A COMPANY
IS RENTING! MY ANSWER: NOPE, SHE CAN'T
SEE NOTHING YOU TYPE OR DO, IN FACT,
SHE DOEN'T EVEN KNOW THE NUMBER YOU
ARE CALLING FROM. THEY YOU SAY, I HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. WRONG! THE
OUTER OPERATOR CAN'T TRACE YOU, BUT
THE SWITCHBOARD CAN! THAT IS WHY THERE
IS A RISK CALLING AND HACKING AT
SPRINT/MCI CODES. HERE ARE A FEW HINTS
SO YOU DON'T GET CAUGHT USING
SPRINT/MCI WHEN YOU FINALLY (SIGH) GET
A CODE.

[1] TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT COMPANY'S
    CODE YOU HAVE. THAT WAY, YOU KNOW
    WHAT TO CALL. FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU
    HAVE THE CODE FOR SHOPPERS DRUG
    MART, YOU WOULDN'T CALL SAFEHOUSE
    BBS IN NEW YORK! BUT IF YOU HAD
    THE CODE FOR NATIONAL TELEWORKS
    CORPORATION, IT WOULD MAKE SENSE
    CALLING A BBS.

[2] CALL AT ONLY THE BUSINESS'S HOURS
    OF OPERATION, IT WOULD LOOK STUPID
    AND SUSPICIOUS CALLING AT 3:00 AM
    WHEN THE COMPANY'S OFFICE BUILDING
    IS CLOSED.

[3] NEVER CALL SOMETHING THAT IS
    CONNECTED TO A PHONE COMPANY.
    THAT COULD PROVE TO BE DARING
    AND VERY DANGEROUS.

[4] NEVER CALL FROM A FORTRESS PHONE,
    BECAUSE IF YOU DO, THE VERY TIME
    YOU CONNECT, IT WILL COME UP ON
    AN INTERCEPT OPERATORS COMPUTER
    (READ ABOUT THESE IN VOLUME #1.)


WELL, THAT IS BASICALLY IT ON HINTS,
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER, NEVER DO STUPID
THINGS WHEN CALLING THROUGH SPRINT OR
MCI. YOU WOULD BE PUTTING YOUR
PHREAKING CAREER ON THE LINE.

NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE AREA CODE
EXCEPTIONS I MENTIONED IN VOLUME #1.
HERE IS A DETAILED DEFINITION OF EACH
OF THE AREA NUMBERS THAT I MENTIONED
WERE USED IN ALL STATES AND PROVINCES:


AREA CODE: 510   TWX    (USA)
=---------------------------=

TWX IS A WATTS SYSTEM, USED MOSTLY
BY MA BELL ITSELF. NOT MUCH USE TO US,
UNLESS YOU ARE TOTALLY INTO FINDING
OUT LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE RATES
TO OTHER COUNTRIES. EXCEPTIONALLY
BORING IN MY OPINION. GTE IS A WATTS
SYSTEM, IF YOU WERE WONDERING.

AREA CODE: 610   TWX    (CANADA)
=------------------------------=

SAME AS U.S.A.'S TWX, EXCEPT IT IS
OR CANADA.

AREA CODE: 700   RESERVED
=-----------------------=

UNKNOWN TO ME. ALL I KNOW, IT IS
NOT USED PRESENTLY, AND IS RESERVED
BY MA BELL FOR LATER USAGE.

AREA CODE: 710   TWX   (USA)
=--------------------------=

ANOTHER STUPID WATTS LINE. NOTHING
TO GET HYPER OVER.

AREA CODE: 800   WATTS LINE
=-------------------------=

THIS WATTS LINE IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
KIND OF WATTS LINE. IT IS USED BY
BUSINESS'S FOR THERE OWN CHAINS OF
STORES TO CALL FREE. ALSO, THEY CAN
BE RENTED FOR PUBLIC USAGE, AND ARE
TOLL-FREE. I AM SURE YOU ALL HAVE SEEN
COMERCIALS SAYING CALL: FRED'S HOOKER
SUPPLY, CALL TOLL-FREE 1-800-XXX-XXXX,
OR SOMETHING TO THAT AFFECT.

AREA CODE: 810   DIAL-IT SERVICES
=-------------------------------=

SAME AS 800 LINES EXCEPT IS COST 50
CENTS THE FIRST MINUTE AND THEN 35
CENTS AFTER THAT FOR EACH EXTRA MINUTE.
NOT MUCH ON THIS. IS ONLY IS U.S.A.
I THINK.

AREA CODE: 910   TWX   (USA)
=--------------------------=

UGH, ANOTHER DUMB WATTS LINE. SAME AS
ALL THE OTHER ONES EXCEPT 800,910.



WELL, THIS WRAPS UP ANOTHER VOLUME.
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THIS ONE, AND
LEARNED SOMETHING. THE VOLUMES WILL
GET MORE TECHNICAL AS THEY INCREASE.
HAPPY HACKING, AND LATER....

IN THIS VOLUME WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW
MA BELL WORKS. BUT, BEFORE I GO ON, I
WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY THANXS TO:

THE HIGHWAY MAN
JUDGE DREDD
MYSTIC WARRIOR
THE WOLF

---------------------------------------

OKAY, SO YOU SAY YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW
MA BELL WORKS EH! WELL, IN THIS VOLUME
I WILL TRY AND COVER ALL KEY POINTS AND
ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. NOW ON WITH
IT.....


BASICALLY, MA BELL IS YOUR LOCAL PHONE
COMPANY (NO KIDDING!). THEY ARE IN
CHARGE OF YOUR PHONES AND LINES RUNNING
FROM YOUR HOUSE OR BUSINESS. YOU ARE
RENTING YOUR PHONE FROM THEM AND THEY
HAVE THE POWER TO TAKE IT AWAY, NO
QUESTIONS ASKED. THEY ARE YOUR LINKS
TO OTHER PLACES LONG-DISTANCE (UNLESS,
YOU'RE USING SPRINT,MCI, OR AT&T).
NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT MA BELL IS, I
WILL GO ON AND EXPLAIN WHAT KIND
OF JUNK THEY DO AND HAVE.

LONG DISTANCE CALLS
=-----------------=

THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE KIND OF LONG
DISTANCE CALLS: A DIRECT DIALED CALL,
OPERATOR-ASSISTED STATION-TO-STATION
CALL, AND OPERATOR-ASSISTED PERSON-
TO-PERSON CALL.

A DIRECT DIALED CALL: A CALL YOU DIAL
DIRECTLY WITHOUT OPERATOR ASSISTED.

OPERATOR-ASSISTED STATION-TO-STATION
CALL: A CALL THAT MAY REQUIRE OPERATOR
ASSISTANCE FOR COMPLETION. YOU WILL
TALK TO ANYONE WHO ANSWERS, BUT YOU
MAY NEED AN OPERATOR'S AID TO REACH THE
NUMBER OR FOR ANY OTHER REASONS.
EXAMPLES OF SUCH CALLS ARE: CALLING
CARDS, COIN CALLS, COLLECT CALLS,
BILLED TO THIRD NUMBER CALLS, HOTEL/
MOTEL CALLS, AND TIME OR CHARGES.
CHARGING BEGINS WHEN THE CALLED TELE-
PHONE IS ANSWERED.

OPERATOR-ASSISTED PERSON-TO-PERSON
CALL: FOR THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WOULD
LIKE TO TALK DIRECTLY TO A PERSON,
TELEPHONE, DEPARTMENT, OR OFFICE
REACHED THROUGH A CUSTOMER'S SWITCH-
BOARD (PBX). PERSON-TO-PERSON CALLS
MAY BE COMBINED WITH CALLING CARDS,
COIN, COLLECT, BILLED TO THIRD NUMBER,
HOTEL/MOTEL, AND TIME AND CHARGES
CALLS. CHARGING STARTS WHEN CONVER-
SATION BEGINS.

CALLING CARDS
=-----------=

A CALLING CARD, YOU MAY PLACE CALLS
FROM TOUCH-TONE PHONES AND CHARGE THEM
TO THEIR CALLING CARDS. THESE CALLS ARE
MORE CONVENIENT THAN "COLLECT" AND
"BILL TO THIRD NUMBER" CALLS.

BILL TO THIRD NUMBER
=------------------=

THIS IS AN INTERESTING FEATURE THAT
MA BELL HAS FOR US. YOU CAN PLACE A
CALL FROM A PHONE AND CHARGE IT TO
YOUR OWN PHONE. WHAT A LITTLE NICE
TRICK TO DO IS, GO TO A PAY PHONE
AND CHARGE THE LONG-DISTANCE PHONE
CALL TO THEM. IT WORKS, CAUSE THE
OPERATOR, THINKS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
MONEY, OR SOMETHING, AND IF YOU ASK
SHE/HE HAS TO GIVE IT TO YOU. TRY
IT. IT CREATES ALOT OF HAVOC...

CONFERENCE CALLS
=--------------=

YOU CAN TALK WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE IN
DIFFERENT PLACES AT THE SAME TIME.
A SPECIAL CHARGE IS MADE FOR THESE KIND
OF CALLS.


WELL, THAT BASICALLY COVERS THE KINDS
OF MAIN CALLS YOU CAN MAKE. OTHER KINND
OF CALLS INCLUDE: TIME AND CHARGE
CALLS, RADIOTELEPHONE CALLS, INTER-
NATIONAL CALLS, 800 SERVICE, 900
SERVICE.

NOW, TO END THIS FILE, I WILL TALK
ABOUT THE THREE TYPES OF SWITCHING
SYSTEMS.

STEP BY STEP SWITCHING SYSTEM
=---------------------------=

IT WAS THE FIRST SWITCHING SYSTEM TO
EVER BE USED BY MA BELL. IT IS A LONG,
AND CONFUSING BUNDLE OF SWITCHES. IT
IS A VERY SUCKY SYSTEM. ITS DISAD-
VANTAGES INCLUDE: SWITCH TRAIN MAY
BECOME JAMMED BLOCKING THE CALL. NO
TOUCH-TONE DIALING. BREAKS DOWN ALOT,
AND USES ALOT OF ELECTRICITY. AND LAST,
BUT NOT LEAST, THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS
HARDWIRED. YOU CAN TELL IF YOU ARE
CALLING THROUGH A STEP-BY-STEP SWITCH-
ING SYSTEM BY JUST A FEW SIMPLE THINGS:
NO PULSING DIGITS AFTER DIALING OR
DTMF. IT SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF TYPE-
WRITERS. THERE IS NO SPEED CALLING,
CALL FORWARD, AND OTHER SERVICES. PAY
PHONE WANTS MONEY FIRST BEFORE DIALING.

CROSSBAR SWITCHING SYSTEM
=-----------------------=

CROSSBAR SWITCHING HAS BEEN MA BELL'S
PRIMARY SWITCHING SYSTEM AFTER 1960.
THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF CROSSBAR
SWITCHING THAT EXIST: #1 CROSSBAR
(1XB), #4 CROSSBAR (4XB), AND #5
CROSSBAR (5XB). A SWITCHING MATRIX IS
USED FOR ALL THE PHONES IN AN AREA.
IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN SOMEONE CALLS, THE
ROUTE WHERE THEY ARE CALLING FROM IS
DETERMINED AND IS MET UP WITH THE OTHER
PHONE. THERE IS REALLY NO DEFINATE RE-
MARKED FEATURES OF CROSSBAR SWITCHING.

ESS SWITCHING
=-----------=

WITH ESS SWITCHING (YUCK!), ANYTHING
YOU PRACTICALLY DO, BELL KNOWS ABOUT
THE TIME YOU PICK UP THE PHONE, TO
THE TIME YOU HANG-UP. WITH ESS MA BELL
KNOWS THE FOLLOWING:

[1] EVERY DIGIT DIALED

[2] WHO YOU CALLED

[3] WHEN YOU CALLED

[4] HOW LONG YOU WERE CONNECTED

[5] IN SOME CASES, WHAT YOU TALKED
    ABOUT!

ESS IS PROGRAMMED TO PRINT OUT PEOPLE
WHO MAKE EXCESSIVE CALLS TO WATT LINES
OR DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE. THIS IS CALLED
"800 EXCEPTIONAL CALLING REPORT" OR
KNOWN EVEN BETTER AS "800 ECR". TRACING
IS DONE VERY QUICKLY AND IS PRINTED OUT
ON THE COMPUTER'S MONITOR OF THE
OPERATOR IN CHARGE. ESS CAN ALSO PICK
UP FOREIGN TONES ON THE LINE, LIKE
BLUE BOX TONE'S (2600 HZ). YOU KNOW
IF YOUR LOCAL PHONE COMPANY IS USING
ESS BY THE FOLLOWING CLUES: SUPPORTS
911 FOR EMERGENCIES. DIAL TONE FIRST
BEFORE PUTTING COIN IN ON PAY PHONES.
CALLING SERVICES LIKE CALL FORWARDING,
SPEED DIALING, AND CALL WAITING.
ANI, (AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION)
FOR LONG DISTANCE CALLS.


WELL, THIS PRETTY WELL WRAPS UP ANOTHER
VOLUME. I HOPE THESE THREE VOLUMES HAS
GIVEN YOU THE BASICS OF THE WICKED WAYS
OF MA. IN MY NEXT VOLUME, I WILL
DISCUSS PHREAKING WITH BOXES. UNTIL
THEN, TTYL......
